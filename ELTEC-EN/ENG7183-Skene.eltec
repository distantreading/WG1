<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p><hi>THE</hi> life of almost every human being is governed by one master
    thought—the life, we say, of human beings, not human vegetables, of which many
    flourish in our soil, making a very goodly show, notwithstanding their
    respectable unconsciousness of all but their material existence. Every thinking
    mortal has a sovereign thought, to which all others are subservient. Sometimes
    its nature causes it to be as a guardian angel to the man, one that walks,
    serene and bright, side by side with his soul through the tempests and the
    turmoil of life; on through the dark valley where the<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7183-003"/> great shadow lies, and beyond it, perhaps, where our
    eyes follow not.</p>
<p>Sometimes its mission seems to be that of a demon, and its foul presence follows
    the spirit through the glittering joys and the sunshine of life on to the dark
    valley—and—with what a dread power beyond it, perhaps!</p>
<p>Now, the thought which had ruled the life and soul of John Forde for many years
    past, looked very like an angel, not only long ago when it was clothed with the
    beauty and brightness of hope, but even now when it came in its mourning
    garments to brood over his heart that was as the grave of a dream long dead. It
    was angel‐like still—for what is so bright or so fair of all the fair things of
    earth, as sweet human love? and it was all the more lovely to his soul that it
    had been so vain. We know how much more beautiful in death the treasures seem to
    grow which we have cherished for their living beauty. Yes, the deep love which
    was the master thought of<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7183-004"/> his existence, had
    ever seemed to him an angel, but had he looked a little closer, he would have
    found that the demon’s mark was upon it—for had it not taken his life and made
    it as sad, and useless, and aimless as though it were a gift but given to be
    squandered away; and had it not absorbed every higher faculty, and feeling, and
    desire of his mind so entirely, that he lived exactly like a man who had never
    heard that there was any other world than this, or any other existence save that
    which was passing for him in such a dull, cold apathy.</p>
<p>What a strange, dreamy‐looking individual he seemed as he sat there gazing
    intently on the fire which he had forgotten to replenish, and watching how the
    flame appeared to feed even upon the ashes. There was a strong likeness between
    himself and his Newfoundland dog, who was also engaged in a meditative manner in
    looking at the dying embers; the expression and the colour of their eyes was at
    least precisely the same, and the resemblance was height‐ <pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7183-005"/> ened by the long, black hair which hung in much
    disorder round John Forde’s plain, but not inexpressive, countenance.</p>
<p>He was very tall and ungainly, his great ill‐shaped hands and feet seemed not to
    fit him properly, and his head was set uncomfortably on his shoulders. He was
    wont to go about the world as if he could not conceive for what reason he had
    been brought into it. He lived quite alone, holding no intercourse with any one,
    and seeking the acquaintance of none: to all appearance he had no occupation
    whatever, and he seemed always half asleep. In reality, however, he had a most
    engrossing employment, which absorbed him entirely. From morning till night did
    he sit day‐dreaming, weaving golden visions of an impossible joy—none knew
    better than himself how impossible it was; but that bright ideal was all that
    life could give him of happiness now, and he learnt to lose himself in these
    glowing fancies so completely, that he had well nigh forgotten the truth of his
        existence.<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7183-006"/> The reality was cold and
    objectless and dark, for he had known no other sunshine save the light of one
    sweet smile, and that had passed away, and therefore he ever fled from it to the
    visionary world he had made, where he could call back that vanished brightness
    from the far vista of the past, and in the inner chambers of his soul he had
    built, as it were, a dwelling for the fair image which was his idol, and there
    night and day he communed with her.</p>
<p>It was strange to what an extent his abstraction from the things of sense had
    arrived; he was scarce conscious of external circumstances, and long habit had
    so increased his power of imagination, that he would carry on the same series of
    ideal scenes for days together, living over again in his dreams by night what he
    fancied in his visions of the day, and only waking from them to give a sort of
    sobbing sigh for their untruth, and then straightway relapsing into their false
    enchantment.</p>
<p>He had lived for the last ten years in his<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7183-007"/>
    present abode, which was a small and comfortable house, placed in one of the
    quietest streets in London. It had come into his possession, along with a
    moderate fortune which he had inherited from an uncle, whose death had thus
    rendered him independent, and had saved him from the life of toil and drudgery
    to which he seemed destined.</p>
<p>Previously to this event, John Forde had been private tutor in a family of much
    respectability.</p>
<p>The night was chill and dark, for it was late in the month of October, and wild
    gusts of wind and rain drove past the windows, whilst the decaying light upon
    the hearth served only to render the room more cheerless; but although the great
    dog occasionally looked wistfully round when the blast howled with increasing
    violence, John Forde seemed unconscious of all that was passing; his bodily
    presence was there, but his soul was far away. The song of summer birds was in
    his ears, the scent of summer flowers in the air,<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7183-008"/> the light of a laughing eye was shining on Ms spirit, and his heart was
    beating high with the ardour of a long‐departed youth. An old, well‐worn Latin
    Grammar lay open on his knees, and from its pages he had been gleaning with the
    strange power of association many a record of the bright days when he had
    studied that same book with his young pupil; now in the deepening shadow the
    lines had grown indistinct, and he had abandoned himself to a fair vision where
    she who had looked with him upon. those pages was seated by his side once more,
    and the holy bonds of an indissoluble union had melted away in his day‐dream as
    though they had never been, while the wife and mother listened as a young girl,
    fancy free, to his own pleading voice.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as he sat there, the bell of the outer door was rung, apparently by an
    impatient hand; for it sent a quick, sharp peal through the house. John started
    involuntarily; he had literally not a friend in the world, so far as he knew at
    least, and it was<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7183-009"/> an unusual hour for any
    tradesman to have left his home. He did not move, however: it could be nothing
    to interest him, for whom life had no interest, and he listened quietly. He
    heard the door opened;—after a few minutes’ parley, in which he distinguished
    only his servant’s voice, it closed again; and then there came a sound of steps
    upon the stair: they fell heavily, but rapid and hurried, as of one upon an
    urgent errand, yet at intervals they ceased entirely, as though the person were
    unable to proceed.</p>
<p>What was there in that step, so heavy and uncertain, that brought back to him
    with vivid startling power the remembrance of a day—one of the gladdest in his
    life—when bounding along the green grass with feet light as the fleetest fawn,
    he had seen a bright form come dancing towards him, and the sweet ringing voice
    that now for ever was echoing deep in his soul, called him gaily to come with
    her far into the woods, where she feared to stray alone? What was there in the
    footfall on the stairs that night which<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7183-010"/> made him
    think of this?—why did he grow pale, and shiver from head to foot, as though
    something unearthly were at hand?</p>
<p>His hands grasped the table for support; his head turned round mechanically, his
    eyes fixed themselves upon the door; some one had paused behind it; he could
    hear the quick breathing, the deep‐drawn sigh, as if the person were utterly
    exhausted; a hand was placed upon the lock; he verily expected to see a ghost
    come in, and was it not a ghost which entered? The ghost of youth, and hope, and
    beauty, the ghost of a life that had been so full of promise, and now was
    perishing in such dark night. It was a woman of some thirty years of age. She
    looked as if she had just arisen from her dying bed; and so in truth she had.
    Her face was ghastly livid, the fever spot burning on her cheek, and the cold
    dew gathering on her brow. It seemed extraordinary that she should have had
    strength to come there. She had been beautiful—how beautiful the throbbing heart
    of poor John Forde could<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7183-011"/> best have told, but it
    was all gone now. The large eyes were sunk in their hollow cavities, the
    features so thin and sharp, the mouth so drawn and distorted with continued
    pain.</p>
<p>Yet he knew her at once. It was more than ten years since he had looked upon that
    face, but still had he not seen it in his dreams every day, nay, every hour? He
    saw no change in her; he only felt it was herself; he saw not that some terrible
    disease was killing her—that some strange event must have brought her there at
    such an hour—that some great agony must have nerved her to leave her couch of
    sickness and come hither through the dark night with the tempest raging round
    her; he thought nothing of all this; he forgot all, save that he saw before him
    the living reality of that fair image which was the star of all his visions.</p>
<p>He forgot who she was, and what he was himself, and all the changes which these
    ten years had wrought for her, if not for him. He forgot that his dreams were
    dreams, and he thought that the truth had<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7183-012"/> been
    a falsity, and that his own dear falsehood was the truth. He thought that she
    had come to realize it all now, to reward him for his deep, long, patient love;
    he wondered he had never seen it must end thus, and that none could love so well
    and be for ever hated,—his heart grew faint with joy, he stretched out his
    trembling hands towards her, his voice faltered like that of a child when it
    proffers some request which it desires intensely—but he murmured only,
    “Millicent, my Millicent, have you come at last?”</p>
<p>And she answered with her sobs, deep, bursting sobs, that seemed as if they would
    have carried away the little life that still was lingering in her sinking frame.
    She wept for that faithful love, so despised and so rejected—for her own past
    scorn in the pride of her happiness. She wept for the days that were to come no
    more, when her heart was so full of hope she had no thought for his despair,
    when the love she had chosen from the many hearts offered to<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7183-013"/> her seemed so pure and so true; she wept for the
    memories that crowded upon her—how she stood a happy bride and cared naught for
    his anguish—and now, like the stricken bird with the vulture pursuing, she came
    mourning to him for pity and help. Oh, her youth and her bloom, her hope and her
    joy, where were they! The friends that were round her had vanished away, and the
    husband that was more than the world together, what had he become! She wept so
    bitterly she could not stand,—all this time she had held in her arms a child,
    who was peacefully sleeping,—she staggered towards a sofa, and laid it down;
    when he saw her movement, he thought that she was going to leave him, that, as
    she had ever done in the unreal visions where he had dwelt with her, she was
    about to pass suddenly from before his eyes, and abandon him to his waking
    reality of hopeless solitude.</p>
<p>He bounded towards her, but his feet were powerless to support him, so bewil‐<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7183-014"/> dered and overcome was he with intense
    emotion; he fell down, and grasping her dress, he clung to it as an infant
    terrified to be left alone in the darkness clings to a mother’s hand;—truly, it
    is a very awful thing, as well as a deadly sin, for an immortal soul to deliver
    up its whole self to such love as this for any earthly being.</p>
<p>“Do not leave me!” he gasped out. “Oh, you know not what days and nights I have
    passed waiting for this hour—you know not the chill and the gloom of this world
    without you. I deserve that you should stay with me, if ever patient, longing,
    and bitter watching by the grave of the past where your image lay entombed, and
    such faithfulness of heart as chose this solitude with one deep thought of you,
    rather than all the pleasures life could give, deserved compassion! Do not leave
    me! It cannot be that any human heart should be so cruel as thus to come and
    thus to pass away.” His words were incoherent, as he poured forth his
    entreaties, but<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7183-015"/> still with his clinging hands
    he held her frantically.</p>
<p>She bent over him with a look intensely mournful, and murmured soothingly, “My
    poor John—my poor, faithful friend!”</p>
<p>She did not remember that once before she had uttered these words in his heating,
    these very words. It was on the morning of her wedding day;—as she came down the
    stairs in her bridal dress to enter the carriage that was to take her to the
    church,—her eye caught a glimpse of the pale, tear‐stained face of the poor,
    despised tutor, whose mad and pertinacious attachment to herself had hitherto
    only called forth her scorn and even ridicule. He was cowering down amongst the
    crowd of servants and dependents who had assembled to see her pass; he had hid
    himself behind them, that, unnoticed in this his bitter hour, he might look for
    the last time on the face of his worshipped idol—<emph>his worshipped
        idol</emph>! What words are these to be used from human clay to human clay!
    Who shall say what judgment they will not<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7183-016"/> call
    down? who shall say what curse they will not carry on to the third or fourth
    generation? yet will any affirm that no such feeling was ever cherished for a
    fellow mortal? Let men look to it who would so scorn the making of graven images
    and the exalting of carved idols to worship them!—let them look to it whether
    the love of any earthly thing hath not set itself up supreme in their
    affections, so that their spirit bows before it, forgetting all other
    adoration.</p>
<p>He was there shivering from head to foot, his hands clasped tightly over his
    heaving breast, his head bent forward, and his eyes, through gushing tears,
    fixing on the young bride their most wistful gaze; for the first time she was
    touched. She had ever treated him with the utmost haughtiness and contempt, but
    she could not look unmoved on this extremity of anguish. Perhaps some
    sympathetic chord was wakened by the latent power of suffering not yet developed
    in her own young heart; but whatever prompted her, as she passed him walking
    over the<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7183-017"/> flowers they had strewn beneath her
    feet, she held out her hand to him, and said, “My poor John—my poor faithful
    friend.” He could not touch her hand. he trembled too much; so she passed on,
    and he saw her face no more; but the words rang on his ears with an
    indestructible sound; they had lived with him through these ten long years; he
    had heard them in his dreams last night, and now he heard them again in actual
    reality.</p>
<p>They brought back the truth to his bewildered mind; the mists and the clouds
    which his long habit of visionary life had gathered on his spirit, seemed to
    clear away as that voice came sounding on his ear; the utter confusion which her
    sudden appearance had caused in his thoughts, passed suddenly from him. He knew
    and remembered all. He raised himself up, and with a shaking hand brushed the
    tears from his eyes, and then he looked on her; he saw and understood who she
    was. These many years she had been the wife of another man, of one whom she had
    loved as he loved her!<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7183-018"/> and yet more,—had none
    other ever come to gain the precious gift of her dear love, it had availed him
    nothing. Those conventional, unrighteous laws which men have made as barriers,
    raised to ward off from them their kind, had placed a gulf between the proud,
    beautiful heiress and himself. He knew and felt it all; he had boldly won her to
    himself in his sweet dreams; he had chosen to forget that ever she was other
    than the fair, young girl of his early days, but in actual life he knew how it
    must be—the requirements of the world’s code of virtues exacted from him an
    outward conformity to the circumstances of their outward position; this it
    required, that in appearance he should seek no part in the existence of that
    wedded wife, but with this much it would be well content;—it would ask no reason
    of a ten years’ longing for an unpermitted lot, of a ten years’ coveting of a
    happiness denied; of a ten years’ cherishing of an unauthorized affection. It
    was enough if, in the sight of men,<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7183-019"/> he had
    resigned himself to his appointed destiny; if outwardly he had made no murmuring
    for the treasure taken from him; if he had never so much as sought to look again
    on that which never could be his; not only would men say this was enough, but
    they would talk with admiration, possibly, of his long, patient, silent,
    hopeless love. They would say it was a noble thing to see how true a human heart
    could be, how constant, even in despair! Oh, false teaching of a most unholy
    world! And was the love permitted? And what availed the conformity of outward
    seeming when the heart was thus rebellious; and because John Forde had never
    breathed a word or moved a step to gain the idol of his life, was it less in him
    a heavy sin so to crave for a happiness refused, and not alone refused by
    distinct and high decree, but made a thing he had no right to crave for? and
    because he was so patient and so humble, and so quiet, was he less an arrogant,
    presumptuous rebel who gave the soul and heart<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7183-020"/>
    that should have worshipped nought on earth, to be an offering to such human
    dust! Ah! that fair outward veil of a world’s virtue—veiling what
    hideousness!—it may serve right well to clothe the flesh until we reach the
    grave‐door, but there, where the flesh itself must be stripped off; woe to the
    soul that has no better garment for the covering of its unholiness than this!
    But John Forde remembered with the words she had uttered, what the Millicent of
    his early love was to him in the world’s sight, and mechanically he drew back
    and murmured, hesitatingly, “Mrs. Grey.”</p>
<p>She sighed heavily. “Yes, it is even so, it is I—myself; but the hour is passing,
    and my time is short, how short, alas! alas! in every way. I came here with an
    earnest purpose, and it must be fulfilled, and I have little strength, and much,
    so much to say; will you listen, patiently, my good, dear, John, as in that
    happy, olden time?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Millicent, Millicent!” he said, and trembled violently.</p>
<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7183-021"/>
<p>“Do you remember,“ she went on, with a smile more sad than ever dying sunbeam on
    a fading autumn sky, “you called me your queen in those bright days! and all I
    ever wished for was done by you, almost before I knew my own thoughts had
    desired it.”</p>
<p>“And so it shall be still,” he said. “All that I was to you when we last met, I
    still must be, not now alone, but ever while I live and breathe. I am unchanged,
    most miserable that I am, unchanged!”</p>
<p>“I knew it,” she answered, sadly; “some instinct told me so, but I must tell you
    why I came, and my strength is failing. There is One waiting for me who will
    admit of no delay. And Death himself must not stop the words upon my lips till
    you have heard my one petition and granted it, if for the dying woman you indeed
    can feel what once was felt for the blooming girl; sit there,” she continued,
    “and I must be at your feet, for I am come a suppliant.”</p>
<p>He took the chair to which she pointed, apparently scarce knowing what he did,
        for<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7183-022"/> he was stunned by the events of the
    last half hour, and truly such an interview, breaking in upon the solitude and
    silence of so many years, might well have bewildered a stronger mind than his;
    he seemed now to have no power but to look upon her face and listen to her
    voice. She took a low seat and placed herself upon it at his feet.</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7183-023"/>
            <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><hi>THE</hi> firelight gleamed on the face of the dying woman as she sat there,
    and showed how very near death she really was. She had fortified herself with
    some powerful stimulant for this exertion, but it was clear that its effect
    would not last long; she had taken off her bonnet, and her hair falling loosely
    round her denoted that she had risen in much haste from her sick bed. The large
    cloak with which she had sought to screen herself from the wind and rain was of
    some coarse material, evidently<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7183-024"/> chosen as a
    disguise; she held it with one hand folded over her breast, that rose and fell
    with the convulsive heavings of fever. What a contrast she was to the bright and
    joyous bride John Forde last recollected her! Then she stood so radiant and so
    blooming in her fair white robes, on the threshold of a life of promise, with
    sunny hope and joy as handmaids at her side,—now she stood on the threshold of
    another life unto whose promise she dared not look, and her attendants were in
    mourning garments—deep penitence and deep remorse.</p>
<p>She sat leaning her head on her hand; looking up into his face with her mournful
    eyes—mournful as are only the eyes of the dying, or of those who, living, weep
    that they have not died more utterly to all the evil they abhor. The sight of
    John Forde seemed to have recalled so many memories of her happy youth, that
    when she spoke it was musingly, as though she were but communing with
    herself.</p>
<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7183-025"/>
<p>“How true it has all proved, how strangely, sadly true—your words have proved,
    dear father! You said we had no right to take our life into our own hands and
    say, ‘I am free; I will make of it what I please. I will play what game with it
    I will—it is for myself alone. I will seek happiness in my own way, and if I
    fail I alone shall suffer.’ You said, one might perhaps with impunity risk
    suffering, but not sin,—and I risked both and have escaped from neither; poor
    father, you strove to struggle then with my heart’s deep love—you might as well
    have striven to fathom or to stem the wild waters of the sea. You said that
    noble, talented, fair to all eyes, as was my lover, William Grey, it never would
    prosper me to be his wife; for that he was one who scoffed at holy things, who
    only sought to drink deep draughts of this life’s pleasure, whose heart was full
    of idols—and himself unto himself the chief. You said that none could touch the
    burning flame and<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7183-026"/> be unscathed—none be wedded
    to corruption and remain unsullied; and I said that because he scoffed I need
    not scoff—because he sinned I need not sin—but rather I would lead him right.
    Alas, alas! and where has he led me!” She bowed her head upon her hands for a
    few minutes, and then suddenly looked up.</p>
<p>“John, I would not have you think I love him, my husband, less than in that hour
    when I told my poor, fond father, in all the pride of my rebellious, selfish
    will, that I would be his wife, or never that of mortal man. No, I will say, as
    you said even now, I am unchanged, most miserable that I am, unchanged; nor yet
    would I have you think he led me wilfully to any evil. My outward life has been
    unstained and bright; the world will tell you I have been a blameless wife and
    mother, most assiduous in my little pleasing duties, most courteous, most
    benevolent; and it is very true—I have been all this, and more—I never injured
    any, I<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7183-027"/> have striven to relieve and comfort
    some; I never murmured when he slighted and neglected me; but if you would know
    the crime for which I suffer now in bitter penitence, it was but this—I forgot
    there was a heaven or a hell. He loved the world so fondly, he taught me to love
    it fondly too; and it is a jealous world, it must have the whole heart or none
    at all—it had all mine! He arranged our plan of life, that it should be one ever
    varying scene of pleasure and amusement. We had wealth at our command,
    surrounding us with every luxury, making us forget that there was suffering or
    evil anywhere. Ah, that prosperity, how terrible a snare it is!”</p>
<p>She had spoken these last sentences in a dreamy, musing tone, rolling herself to
    and fro as if in pain, and John Forde sat listening to her with large tears, of
    which he was all unconscious, stealing down his cheeks; her voice was so very
    sad, so like to the rise and fall of the sighing wind on<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7183-028"/> a dreary night, none could have heard it unmoved—how
    far less could he! Suddenly the little child who lay sleeping on the sofa, moved
    in its slumber, and slightly moaned.</p>
<p>The mother started at the sound, as if a voice had called her angrily; her pale
    cheek crimsoned; her eye sparkled with a sudden energy; she clasped her hands
    like one who asks forgiveness.</p>
<p>“My child, my child! that any thought of other days, that any memory of departed
    hope, sweet though it be, should lead me to forget how on this hour hangs your
    whole life’s destiny! Alas, to think that one could be so weak as thus to sit
    dreaming by the side of her own yawning grave!” She turned and raised herself so
    that she was almost kneeling before him.</p>
<p>“John, I need not tell you that I am sinking under a mortal disease—that the
    grasp of death is tightening on my heart most rapidly—that a few days must
    terminate my life. It is therefore the petition of a dying woman that I beseech
    of you to<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7183-029"/> grant—of one who never will live to
    ask another. Listen, then, while I tell you briefly, as those must speak for
    whom the worms await, what is my heart’s desire—the desire you alone can grant.
    To explain it, you must know that my husband, not content with luxury and
    dissipation, and a life wherein no master was acknowledged but his own corrupt
    and lawless will, soon passed to deeper shades of crime. There is no standing
    still, no passive inaction for the soul! On, on, by the steep ascent and the
    toilsome path, from a longing after purity unto the purity itself, or downward
    by the smooth alluring way from indifference to forgetfulness, from
    forgetfulness to hate; and it was so with him. He hates now all that is not
    evil. Gambling, revelry, and the allurements of sin in every shape, have gotten
    him in their possession. My house from day to day is filled with those who live
    but for the pleasures of the world; and there is one among them with a face as
    fair as her hidden soul is black, to whom he will<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7183-030"/> give my place when I am gone. I know it—know it well.” She bowed her head,
    and the deep sobs burst forth again; but soon driving back the burning tears,
    she went on:</p>
<p>“I took pleasure in that society; I made my joy and my delight in that brilliant
    life of gaiety for many years; I never thought of looking what depths might be
    beneath that sparkling surface; I never thought of saying to my spirit, Is all
    well with thee? art thou ready when the dark‐winged angel comes? But at last he
    did come whose office is to strip the covering of beauty from all deceitful
    things. Death came, and then I learnt to know what I had been so long, and am. I
    must not tell you of myself—he leaves me not the time. I must not tell you all
    that I would give to stand once more beside you as I stood upon my wedding
    morning, a bride, not yet a wife; knowing so little evil, an innocent girl in an
    honourable, quiet home, with that good old father warding off unhallowed things.
    How would I tear away the bridal veil, and fling aside the<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7183-031"/> bridal robe, and betake me to the sackcloth and the
    ashes, if beneath them I could keep my heart in purity. No, I must tell you only
    of one deep thought that came as it were hand in hand with death, and that has
    eaten into my very soul since then. It is for my child—my little angel
    child—pure as the stainless lily, guileless and sportive as the tender lamb—it
    is for her—that she may never, never live as I have lived, and never come to be
    what I now am. But I am dying. Who will watch her?—who will guard her?—who will
    save her—save her from her father!—yes, from him! Do you know what he once said?
    It was one day after I knew that I was going fast where the soul can make to
    itself no fair deception, that suddenly my love for him, unquenchable, came
    swelling so strongly through my heart, I could not bear that he should risk such
    perishing, and I flung my arms round him, and besought him, with many an
    imploring word and truthful argument, to think on all that was to come; but oh!
    with what<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7183-032"/> bitter anger did he fling me from
    him, and ask if I were mad, to speak such hateful folly in his ears; and then—he
    well knew how best to be revenged on me. He took my child, my little child, and
    held her in his arms, as though for a witness to his oath, and swore that in
    her, at least, he would have no canting hypocrite, that she should never so much
    as hear the things that were so odious to him. A merry life should she lead—no
    fear of aught before her eyes! And <emph>she</emph> to whom he will give my
    place when I am gone, she, too, was there, and said, with such a smile, it were
    well, in truth, for once to educate a child free from the foolish trammels and
    the needless burden of a faith and a required duty;—and I helpless in my shroud,
    what should I do?</p>
<p>“Oh, John, dear John, my agony was very great for many days, and then the thought
    of you came like a sunbeam to my soul—of you, my faithful, truest friend; for
    you must save her, you must take her,<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7183-033"/> you must
    guard her from her father. Yes, my child must be stolen from her father; there
    is no other means. Whole days and nights I have lain and thought upon it,
    racking my very soul to find a method of escape for her—and there is none save
    this. I know not if it be not in itself a crime to steal a child from its
    surviving parent—I have no power now to discern between right and wrong; I only
    know she must not stay with him, he would fulfill his impious oath! for his
    soul’s ease he would,—that none might ever warn him. Oh, she must not stay with
    him; she must never breathe the atmosphere of that unhappy house, my most
    unhallowed home; she must be taken now in her young innocence, and reared as the
    spotless snowdrop in some hidden nook, where no polluting breath shall ever
    stain my snow‐white flower; and you must take her, John, dear John,—there is
    none other who could conceal her from her father. I have arranged it all—you
    shall have no trouble<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7183-034"/> —my fortune is secured to
    her—and I will leave a letter for her aunt, a letter to be given when I am
    buried,—for none refuse the dead who cry to them,—telling her all the truth, and
    praying her to watch, though at a distance, over my sweet child, and never to
    reveal her residence until her father’s death—then she will take her from you,
    John, and you shall be free again,—only that my spirit will continue still to
    bless you. Oh, I scarce can speak with the intensity of my desire; say that you
    will grant my prayer, dear John, my dying prayer, speak peace to my poor aching
    heart; you know not how I love that child. They say the dead will rest whatever
    be; I think that I could rest whatever passed on earth, excepting it were that
    little one in danger. Ah, tempt me not to take her with me, to brand my soul
    undying with the stain of murder, and thus to save hers from contamination;
    tempt me not to this, but take her, take her now this night—to‐morrow, go
        with<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7183-035"/> her across the sea, to some far
    distant country, where her father and her father’s wife shall never hear of her.
    There guard her in innocence, in holiness, in peace, and such blessings as a
    mother’s heart alone could conceive in recompense shall, with my dying breath,
    be yours.”</p>
<p>She had spoken with such exceeding vehemence, her abrupt and rapid utterance had
    gained such energy from the fever raging in her veins, that now the false
    strength went from her utterly: she sank down breathless, panting, and
    exhausted.</p>
<p>As for John Forde, his whole frame was shaking with emotion; that she should have
    been so wretched, that she should come praying to him for succour, that she
    should doubt his willingness to die for her—all these thoughts filled his heart
    to bursting, and he could not speak. At length she lifted up her face; she knew
    not what his silence meant, and the anguish of suspense was most unbearable. Her
    countenance showed that the exertions of<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7183-036"/> this
    night had greatly shortened her brief remaining life; her eyes had brightened as
    though all the soul had gathered there, but the pale lips could scarcely
    articulate.</p>
<p>“Speak—say—will you—will you grant my prayer, and save my child?” She joined her
    hands, and lifted them in supplication; “for the sake of the dear love wherewith
    you loved me in brighter days!”</p>
<p>The look which he gave her was describable; there was in it such a world of
    unutterable affection, of mournful reproach, of anguish for her suffering most
    intense, but because of the very depth and strength of the feelings struggling
    in his heart, his answer was very simple, “Are you not, Millicent?”</p>
<p>It was enough, quite enough; she rose at once, and going to the sofa she knelt
    down beside her child and laid her pale brow, damp with the dews of death, upon
    the little, soft hands folded in that sleep of guilelessness; and then no sound
    was heard<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7183-037"/> save the infant’s gentle breathing,
    that sounded not as if this life could ever make it swell out to a bitter sigh.
    When she rose she was very calm, but spent and worn, she spoke with
    difficulty.</p>
<p>“I am so feeble, I think death is at hand, and the little strength I have, must
    now be given to take me home; they must not know I ever left it. I said I would
    be alone, that I wished to sleep a few hours quietly; I bade them come again at
    midnight, and so they went, and I stole softly out and came on wandering hither.
    Thankful I am I came to find such peace—oh, thankful as no words can say; but
    now I must return, that they may find me when they come—her they will not find,
    and never shall. Oh, joy unspeakable!—Her old nurse is below, a faithful
    creature, whom I trust entirely; she loves me well, and she will go with you
    wherever you may take my child. She will tell you all, better far than I can
    now. My words must be few, for he is devouring the breath upon my lips; say once
        again,<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7183-038"/> dear John, that you will take her
    from this city and this land to‐morrow.”</p>
<p>And he answered at once, “To‐morrow!” but as he saw her raise those eyes so
    peaceful, now that they were beautiful once more, with a long, fixed gaze of
    thankfulness, and then move slowly to depart, he suddenly rose with convulsive
    energy from his place. His breath came thick and fast from his labouring chest,
    his eyes were wild with their look of terror. The concentrated anguish of that
    moment could scarcely find vent in words; he only said, “Millicent, do not go,”
    but he grasped her arm at the same time with a strength of which he was
    unconscious. She saw at once, that unless she had power to overcome his
    overwhelming emotion, a scene would ensue which must kill her; gently she took
    his hand, calmly she looked into his face, and the mild gaze of her dear eyes
    soothed him. Softly she spoke in a low, sweet voice, “John, I know it is a sad
    thing for you that I should go, very sad that I should die, but you have<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7183-039"/> deepest comfort in knowing how strangely happy
    you have made that death, and you can make it happier still, you can brighten
    yet more the dark way for me—you will, I know you will, when I have told you
    how. Dear John, when we last parted I went with a smile and you with tears, and
    often since, those tears of yours have fallen on my spirit very bitterly; their
    recollection filled me with remorse, and now, to‐night, I have wept many such,
    and your kind hand has wiped them all away; let me see you smile then as I go
    forth. Let me think no more with vain regret upon your bitter weeping for my
    scorn and cruel neglect; let me carry with me the remembrance of your smile,
    because to‐day I have acknowledged all your faithfulness and truth, and thanked
    and blessed you for it; it will lighten the shadows deepening round me in
    mysterious gloom, if I can remember the last look of your face in gladness.
    Smile on me, good, dear John, and so shall be our kind farewell,”</p>
<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7183-040"/>
<p>He had never disobeyed her, nor did he now, but there are no words to say what
    that obedience cost him. He looked on her and smiled; her own face brightened
    strangely as she met his gaze—she stooped till her cold lips touched his hand,
    then pointed to the sleeping child, and so going forth she left them both and
    went her way. He never looked upon her face again.</p>

<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p><hi>A SUMMER’S</hi> evening in Provence—what a bright, sweet vision these words
    bring up before the memory of those who know that smiling land! such a
    breathless, cloudless beauty over earth and sky, such a softness in the breeze
    that steals along, wandering to find the orange flowers and rob them of their
    fragrance; such a brightness in the lingering of the sunset and in the dawning
    of the moon and stars, and over all so calm and soothing a repose; an intensity
    of rest<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7183-042"/> and quiet best suited to those who, in
    the decline of life, are fain to take their ease in stillness after the long,
    sore journey, or who, in the decline of hope, are weary of the world’s tumult,
    and would be alone to see if their own heart can tell them nothing better; that
    evening’s quietude, however, was by no means congenial to the gay, young girl
    who sat there beneath the olive‐trees. It was in a large garden attached to one
    of the best houses in the quaint old town of Aix, a pleasant spot, not far from
    the noble church, whose deep bell, tolling nightly, failed not to send its
    solemn echoes through those quiet bowers.</p>
<p>Millicent Grey had never known another home; at least she remembered none save
    this, and every object which surrounded her was most familiar; her great,
    restless eyes, sparkling with the first ardour of youth and hope, went ranging
    impatiently from side to side as if in search of something new. At last she
    turned and fixed them on the old French bonne who sat in state before her as<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7183-043"/> her appointed companion. There was something
    irresistibly attractive in this little old woman: she was so neat, so trim, in
    her pretty Provencâl costume. Her small, piercing black eyes twinkled with an
    expression of such comical merriment, though set in a countenance which
    certainly was uncommonly ugly, whilst her wide mouth, with its range of splendid
    white teeth, gave evidence of the most determined good humour. She sat knitting
    some indescribable piece of work with extraordinary speed, and every now and
    then looked up at her young charge with a gay, happy smile, which had in it no
    particular meaning, but was only designed to express her perfect contentment
    with the world in general. Millicent looked at her for a long time: then
    suddenly starting from her seat she threw herself down on the grass at her feet,
    and taking her by the two hands, exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Oh, Nanette, Nanette,—how I wish you would change your face!”</p>
<p>“Ma chérie!” said the old woman in<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7183-044"/> astonishment,
    and then laughed merrily; “and why?”</p>
<p>“Because it is always the same face, every day the same, it never tells me
    anything new—nothing ever does; everything goes on the same.”</p>
<p>“Ah bien, mais que veux tu? I would do anything to amuse you, but as to this —”
    She shrugged her shoulders with a comical grimace.</p>
<p>“No, no,” said Millicent, putting her arms round her. “I was joking, good
    Nanette, I would not change your dear, old face, not even if I could, I lave it
    much too well—no—but I know what I do wish,” she added, with a sigh.</p>
<p>“And what is it?” asked Nanette, “sure you shall have it if it is not quite so
    impossible as the last.”</p>
<p>“That I am sure it is,” said Millicent, “so I need not think about it; but what I
    should like would be that some one should come here, some one very grave and
    wise and good,—some one from England, I fancy<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7183-045"/>
    they are very wise there—that such a person should come and answer all the
    questions I would put to him.”</p>
<p>“And what would you ask?” said Nanette.</p>
<p>“What would I ask? Oh, everything; there is so much that bewilders and confuses
    me. I want to find out the meaning of the whole world, and the reason and
    purpose of all that goes on in it. You do not understand me, Nanette, and I do
    not think I quite understand myself; but I go living here all alone, so to
    speak, from day to day with such strange, restless thoughts working in me, that
    I scarce can bear it. Uncle Forde never talks to me, and I know all you could
    tell me, Nanette dear, which is not much; and everything I read and see only
    shows me the outward surface, it tells me that things are so, such life and
    death, and joy and sorrow, but it never tells me <emph>why</emph>! I am sure, in
    all existence, there is a hidden reason which I cannot penetrate.”</p>
<p>“And why should you, my mignonne? At<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7183-046"/> sixteen one
    ought to find out only the best way to amuse one’s self. Ah, when I was
    sixteen—”</p>
<p>“You liked singing and dancing as well as I do now, did you not, chère Nanette?
    Well, but one cannot dance and sing all one’s life; one did not come into the
    world for that alone, because then what would be the use of all the old, stiff
    people. Now, that is precisely what puzzles me, that is the very first question
    I should like to ask my wise man if he would only come; I want to know what we
    are all living for! What is the use of life? What are we to do with it now we
    have got it?”</p>
<p>“Ah bien,” said Nanette, looking quite bewildered; “and what does every one do
    with it?”</p>
<p>“What do they do with it? Why, they eat, and they drink, and they sleep, and they
    take a great deal of trouble to keep themselves alive now they are living, but
    then I say, what for? pourquoi? what is the use of living only to keep ourselves
    alive?”</p>
<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7183-047"/>
<p>“Sais‐je moi,” said Nanette, shrugging her shoulders; “but no, my petite, we do
    more than eating and sleeping; look, I am knitting!”</p>
<p>“Very well, so you are; now then, let us analyze the knitting. I am not going to
    touch it, don’t be afraid, I am only going to pull it morally to pieces. This
    piece of knitting, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Why, a stocking, and that is very useful, I am sure; it will keep my feet
    warm.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but you are obliged to keep your feet warm, because you are alive; you
    don’t live to keep your feet warm.”</p>
<p>This sort of reasoning was quite bewildering to Nanette: she looked comically at
    her work for a few minutes as if she ought to be disgusted with it, but its hold
    on her affections was far too firm. She gave a careless smile, seeming to
    intimate that, however unworthy, her knitting must ever be dear to her, and
    taking it up again, plied her needles vigorously. Millicent went on, “It is the
    same in everything; now when M. le<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7183-048"/> Roux died
    last year, his wife came here making such lamentations. Oh, he was such a loss,
    what would the world do without him; a man of such taste, such an elegant mind,
    and always busy, never idle a moment; he had built that great house and laid out
    those beautiful grounds; he had superintended the placing of every stone
    himself. It had taken him ever so many years, but it was a charming place to
    live in when it was done, and then he had grown so used to the occupation, that
    after the house was finished he kept adding room upon room only for employment.
    Well, M. le Roux spent all his life there in making himself a place to live in,
    and died of old age when it was about ready; his wife married and they sold the
    house, and even M. le Roux’s bones did not get a comfortable grave there. So I
    just ask you, Nanette, don’t you think M. le Roux might quite as well not have
    lived at all?”</p>
<p>“Ah, poor M. Le Roux!” said Nanette, deprecatingly.</p>
<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7183-049"/>
<p>“Bien! but there was also young Adolphe, who was thrown from his horse and
    killed; what a state every one was in about him, how they all said it was such a
    misfortune, such a fine young man, any one could have been better spared; but
    what did M. Adolphe ever do, excepting play billiards and try to valser à deux
    temps? What was the good of his living? What was the use of him?”</p>
<p>“My dear,” said Nanette, imposingly, with the air of a person who is sure of her
    position; “the père André has often told me nothing was ever made without a
    use.”</p>
<p>“Then I wish some one would tell me my use,” said Millicent, with a sigh; “for
    here I go on eating and sleeping and living, for no purpose that I can see.”</p>
<p>“I will tell you what,” said Nanette, briskly; “the use of living is that we may
    be happy, which we could not be unless we were alive. I am sure it is that; I am
    convinced of ”</p>
<p>“Well, I could understand, that,” ex‐<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7183-050"/> claimed
    Millicent, “for it is such a charming thing to feel so happy as I do sometimes.
    But then every one is not happy—nor any one always, not even you and I, Nanette;
    and look at Uncle Forde, what a wretched man he is. And then, again, to be
    happy, there is a something wanting, I don’t know what it is, a something which
    one’s inmost heart requires, and which nothing external can procure. One cannot
    sit down and say—now I am going to be so happy, I am determined to be so very
    happy—you may be sure one would feel terribly discontented if one did. There is
    a vacancy, a restlessness in one’s spirit, which is not satisfied with only a
    pleasant aspect to the outer world. I cannot understand it.”</p>
<p>She turned suddenly, and raising her bright young face, to which some earnest
    thought had given a look of gravity quite foreign to her usual expression, she
    said, in a low tone:—</p>
<p>“Nanette, I am certain of this; there<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7183-051"/> is a
    secret in life which I do not comprehend, and perhaps never shall.”</p>
<p>Nanette stooped to kiss her fondly, and then smoothing the flowing hair that
    shaded the young girl’s face, she said:—</p>
<p>“I cannot bear that you should not know everything you want to know, my darling.
    Why don’t you ask M. Forde? Perhaps he could tell you. He must surely grow very
    wise, sitting so silent, thinking all day long. It makes me go to sleep to look
    at him; so he must be very leaned, for I always go to sleep when I read a grave
    book. I should ask him, if I were you; perhaps he could explain it all.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps he could,” said Millicent, thoughtfully. “It is worth the trial, at all
    events. I will go to him.”</p>
<p>She returned the embrace of the old bonne with warm affection, and bounding
    across the garden, entered the house: then very gently and quietly she opened
    the door, and stole into the room where she knew she should find her
    guardian.</p>
<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7183-052"/>
<p>His hands folded on his knee, his eyes fixed, his bead drooping on his breast,
    John Forde sat in exactly the same attitude as we saw him fourteen years before,
    when the dying mother of the young girl who now stood by his side, came, in her
    last extremity, to implore the succour of him she had so despised.</p>
<p>The singular plan which she had adopted in order to save her child from that most
    unnatural misfortune, a father’s evil influence, had been strangely successful;
    at least, in so far as that Millicent Grey had been conveyed from England the
    very next day, and had remained at Aix ever since, without having held the
    slightest communication with Mr. Grey. The letter which Mrs. Grey had written to
    Mrs. Egerton, her half‐sister, on behalf of the child over whom she could watch
    no more, had produced its full effect, as she expected. Mrs. Egerton was not a
    person to lend her assistance willingly to any project that looked romantic, or
    to burden herself<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7183-053"/> any more duties than those
    which her position in life imposed upon her, and which she most ably performed,
    at least so she was wont to certify herself by many significant hints. But an
    appeal from the grave is never unheeded: there are scarce any who could dare to
    slight it, albeit unconscious of the motive which constrains them so
    scrupulously to perform to the very letter the last wishes of the departed. They
    believe that they are thus careful because they consider it a sacred duty (how
    sacred in truth they little know), but were they to analyze their feelings a
    little more closely, they would find that they were chiefly actuated by a
    superstitious dread, an unacknowledged terror that their midnight rest would be
    disturbed by the pale phantom, whose wishes they had neglected, coming to gaze
    on them with reproachful eyes, because they had no compassion for the great
    helplessness of death.</p>
<p>Whatever might have been Mrs. Egerton’s motives, however, she was determined
        rigidly<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7183-054"/> to follow the instructions of her
    dying sister with regard to Millicent Grey. The letter informed her that Aix was
    to be the place of the child’s abode, and charged her most carefully to conceal
    all knowledge of the fact from her father. There was to be a regular
    correspondence between John Forde and Mrs. Egerton, so that she might always be
    certain that the child was well cared for, and at the death of Mr. Grey,
    whenever that might occur, she was entreated to receive Millicent into her own
    home. Should she die herself first, another relation was to be appointed to
    undertake the charge, for which the fortune secured to the young girl could give
    an ample remuneration. But Mrs. Grey plainly foresaw that a life so dissipated
    and reckless as that of her husband could not be greatly prolonged. She herself
    survived only a few days after her interview with John Forde, and it was some
    time before Mr. Grey rightly understood that she had really taken means to place
    the child out<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7183-055"/> of his reach. His anger was at
    first excessive; but having ascertained, as he was enabled to do without much
    difficulty, that she had been established somewhere on the continent, he found
    it would be a great deal of trouble to have her restored to himself, and
    gradually he ceased to wish it. The care of a young child was by no means a duty
    congenial to his tastes, and in process of time he almost forgot her existence,
    excepting to wish, when he found himself a ruined man, that he could obtain
    possession of the fortune Millicent inherited from her mother. He married again,
    as the instinct of the neglected wife’s affection had prophesied, and his bride
    was even less than himself disposed to undertake the burden of a step‐daughter’s
    education.</p>
<p>Thus John Forde remained perfectly unmolested with his young charge; and no
    change whatever had occurred in their position since the first day that he
    established himself at Aix with the little infant whom he diplomatically called
    his niece.</p>
<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7183-056"/>
<p>For the first few years he imagined himself exonerated from making any attempt to
    educate her. He left her entirely to the motherly care of Nanette, who had
    replaced the English nurse soon after their arrival, and only took measures
    every day to ascertain that she was alive, and likely to live. He had recourse
    to various extraordinary expedients in order to convince himself of this fact,
    sometimes making the most horrible grimaces, in order that the frightened child
    might attest to the strength of her lungs by loud screams of terror, or else
    giving vent to an unearthly howl, that he might have the comfort of seeing her
    run vigorously away. With some one such effort made every day he acquitted
    himself to his own satisfaction of his duties as guardian for a considerable
    time. At last, however, several startling remarks made by Millicent began to
    awaken him to the fact that she was fast advancing out of infancy, and that it
    was absolutely necessary to give her some instruction. It was now that John was
    sorely perplexed;<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7183-057"/> he was nearly certain that
    something ought to come before all the Latin and mathematics with which he
    proposed to enlighten her ultimately, but he vainly endeavoured to discover what
    was the first branch of science in which young ladies were usually instructed.
    To his infinite relief, however, when he came to examine into the matter, he
    found that Nanette had taken it into her own hands, and that she had already
    taught the child to read and write, to embroider, and to sing with a voice sweet
    and clear as the notes of a wild spring bird.</p>
<p>Soon after, he was also further relieved from his responsibility by the
    intervention of a very clever and amiable French lady, whose little daughter was
    Millicent’s playmate, and who, compassionating the neglected condition of the
    clever English child, proposed to John that his niece should take lessons along
    with her own little girls from the various masters whose services she considered
    necessary. He was too happy to agree to this plan, and the result<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7183-058"/> was, that Millicent, at sixteen, had all the
    accomplishments which the world requires from persons in her station, and withal
    a great deal of curious information in the abstruser sciences, for which she was
    indebted to the teaching of John himself. She was naturally clever; and with a
    fund of vivacity and light‐heartedness she also combined great depth of thought,
    and an active penetrating mind; but there was one peculiarity in her education
    which was destined to have a most powerful influence on her whole future
    destiny. Whilst ample learning was given her to supply her intellectual wants as
    an inhabiter of this world, her young earnest soul was altogether shut out from
    the vast range of spiritual knowledge.</p>
<p>A fitting teacher truly, in the faith of an immortal soul, would John Forde have
    been, who had never known any other worship save the idolatry of heart wherewith
    he bowed himself before the creature of clay; for it mattered not what he
    professed himself—of professors we have enough; and very fair and angel‐like
    this race of man<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7183-059"/> would be if only the hidden
    spirit, sullied and dust‐cleaving, had some little affinity with that universal
    profession; but we do not make poison into wine by putting a label on the bottle
    to that effect. It had never occurred to John Forde to think what he really was
    in this respect himself; his soul chained to its human idol had no power to look
    around or upward; but in considering the education of Millicent Grey, it did
    strike him that the faith of her fathers was one of the things she must be
    taught. Well, he would teach it to her. This was easily done. It should take its
    course along with other sciences.</p>
<p>There were several standard works which gave her the various doctrines in their
    regular order; and he had found her so apt a scholar, when he instructed her in
    the rudiments of chemistry and astronomy, that he doubted not she would learn
    religion without much trouble. He taught it to her as a species of moral
    mathematics; and so soon as she was thoroughly conversant with the leading
    principles—accurate in her knowledge of<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7183-060"/> the
    more important facts—and quite dear, especially respecting dates and localities,
    he conceived he had abundantly done his duty, and recurred to the subject no
    more.</p>
<p>To Millicent Grey it was therefore what it is to three parts of the world, an
    abstract theory, which had no more to do with the hidden life of her spirit,
    than those astronomical calculations in which she was often engaged, and a
    matter as completely external from herself as the code of virtues which she was
    taught to admire in the heathen philosophers of old. Like the millions who have
    gone before her and the millions who will come after, she treated it usa manual
    of useful knowledge not likely to be immediately in requisition, and therefore
    to be laid aside with much respect till such time as she should reach the Gate
    of the Tomb, when it would serve as a passport to that other life in which she
    duly believed, and of which she never thought. It is not <emph>natural</emph> to
    the young heart to look beyond this present world, this palpable, visible<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7183-061"/> reality, with its manifold attractions,
    because no bitter experience has ever taught them that it can never, with all
    its bright things, fill their own immensity of longing. The cloudless eyes for
    whom no tears of disappointment have dimmed the brightness of this mortal home,
    turn not easily from the fair, ideal future in which they hope on earth.</p>
<p>Youth has a faith and a worship of its own; the worship is the adoration of
    happiness, and they imagine this god of their idolatry to be enthroned among the
    sunny bowers of this world, which is so beautiful, so sorrowful, (but beautiful
    only to their trusting innocence,) little dreaming that a mild, pure angel,
    distant as angels are, it wanders even now in far greener pastures. The faith is
    in life, this mortal life in which they believe as containing the sure promise
    of all the joy which their imagination pictures, and for which their living
    spirit craves.</p>
<p>It was so with Millicent Grey; there was a restlessness in that fresh untamed
    nature, a questioning in that warm, loving heart, a<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7183-062"/> stumbling even in the spring time of her days at the
    mystery of life, but she sought its solution only in the narrow compass of the
    visible; it never occurred to her that one mystery might unlock the other, and
    the problem of death solve that of life.</p>
<p>And so the bright‐eyed, sunny‐hearted girl stole up to the old, way‐worn man and
    stood looking at him. John Forde was still the same weary traveler into the
    unattainable regions of the past, the same hapless dweller in a land of shadows;
    day by day and night by night had only witnessed the deepening madness of his
    soul.</p>
<p>One would have thought that when his idol crumbled into dust he would have ceased
    to worship it, but it was not so. When the news of her death first reached him,
    he was stunned and bewildered, like a man stricken with sudden blindness. Her
    ideal presence, in which he had so long dwelt, had been to him all in all; he
    had learnt to concentrate therein every joy of which the various faculties of
    the heart are<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7183-063"/> capable. Now, in his visions, she
    was the embodiment of hope to him; now hope realized; now sympathy, when in
    fancy he told her all he had suffered and she wept for and with him; now
    happiness, full and complete, when he saw her stealing towards him with the
    sweet promise on her lips that she would never leave him more! and when he heard
    that she was gone from earth, all this seemed to have past away with her—he
    suddenly found himself alone as in a desert where no light was, a rayless,
    silent waste.</p>
<p>The spirit cannot rest on vacancy, and this mental solitude was unendurable; he
    knew not where to turn for relief; shut out from that enchanted land where he
    had taught his soul to dwell more fondly than it would have done perhaps in joys
    that were real, he seemed lost in some dark immensity. For days and nights he
    wandered about like one beside himself, seeming as though his wild, staring eyes
    were ever in search of some lost treasure. At length utterly exhausted with the
    very bewilderment of his sorrow,<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7183-064"/> he laid
    himself down on the floor and slept; in that sleep he dreamt one night, and
    dreamt of her. She came to him radiant and blooming as though no death hue were
    on the cheek of the shrouded corpse whose representative she was; again her
    smile lit up the boundless world of his fancy, and life became once more a glad
    possession!</p>
<p>And when he awoke from this sweet vision, he could not bear to part from it. He
    buried his face in his hands and went on dreaming, and soon he found that for
    his strange, ideal life, it mattered little whether the image, which was the sun
    in that world of his creation, were the phantom likeness of one living and
    absent, or of a cold and coffined corpse. Where all was most unreal, the actual
    truth could have no influence, and his imagination could lift her out of her
    dark grave, rigid and helpless as she was, and deck her mouldering form in hues
    of youth and health, filling her marble hands with the flowers she was wont to
    love, as easily as once it drew her from her husband’s side<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7183-065"/> and from the cradle of her child, to pass before his
    eyes a playful, merry girl.</p>
<p>From that hour he relapsed into his former visionary state, and the excess of
    this mental enjoyment seems to have deadened his other faculties completely. He
    lived as though he were a stranger among men, having no share in the common
    existence. He was ever listening so intently to the sweet voice murmuring deep
    within his soul, that most often he heard naught of what was passing round him;
    and the one image on which his longing eyes were ever fixed, shut out from his
    sight all things more palpable and real.</p>
<p>Millicent had stood by his side sometime quite unobserved, gazing at him with her
    bright, restless eyes. Of all the problems which life seemed to offer for her
    great bewilderment, none was so completely inexplicable to her as the existence
    of John Forde. The knitting of stockings did give a certain interest to
    Nanette’s life, but her strange, old uncle had not even the excitement of<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7183-066"/> dropping a stitch occasionally. There seemed
    nothing in the whole world for which he wished to live, and yet he took just as
    much trouble to preserve existence, by due supplies of nourishment, as others
    did. Some one great thought certainly occupied him entirely, and she had a vague
    conviction, in her own mind, that if she could discover it she would gain some
    insight into that secret use of life which was as yet such a mystery to her. She
    sat down at his feet and taking his listless hand, looked up into his face.</p>
<p>“Dear uncle, please to wake up: I want to speak to you.”</p>
<p>Millicent was somewhat of a spoilt child. John Forde had never dreamt of
    controlling her, and Nanette had but one wish in the world, which was to see her
    look happy. The good little woman would have put herself to the extremest
    torture rather than have darkened, in any way, the smile upon the sunny face she
    loved so well. Fortunately,<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7183-067"/> however,
    Millicent’s generous disposition and most unselfish, loving heart, had saved her
    from many of the evils such indulgence is apt to produce. John turned at the
    sound of her voice, and was going to ask her what she wanted, but as he looked
    on her face, he began, dreamily, to trace out the likeness between herself and
    her dead mother, and soon forgot all else. She pressed his hand somewhat
    impatiently.</p>
<p>“Would you try to hear me only for one moment? There is something I want so very
    much to know, and I have no one but yourself to ask, or indeed I would not
    trouble you.”</p>
<p>Millicent was really in earnest, and there was something plaintive in the tone of
    her voice which stung him with a sort of remorse. He roused himself at once.</p>
<p>“My dear child, tell me all you would say. You are not unhappy, Millicent;
    surely, surely you are not unhappy! What should I do, most wretched that I am,
    if there were any sorrow in your heart? She said<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7183-068"/> she could not rest if there were evil near you!”</p>
<p>“No, no! do not look distressed, dear uncle; how wrong I was to disturb you so. I
    am not unhappy! I do not well know what sorrow means, only I have been
    bewildered about many things of late, and you are so wise I am sure you can
    explain them all. I will tell you how it is. I am passing out of childhood now,
    and I feel that the days are flitting on without my having found out for what
    purpose they are given me. Until now I have been happy whenever the day was
    bright and the sunbeams sparkling, when the birds were merry and the flowers
    blooming; and only sad and weary when the rain came down and crushed my poor,
    sweet blossoms to the ground, and sent the nightingales all fluttering to their
    nests. But now I feel somehow that there must be another sunshine for our lives
    than only the sunshine of the sky; my mind is restless, and I know not why. I
    have a wish, a longing, and I cannot tell <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7183-069"/> for
    what; I feel convinced that there is some great good, some happiness in life
    which must be the reason of our living; and each morning I think—perhaps I shall
    know of it to‐day, and when I go to sleep at night, I think—will it not come to
    me to‐morrow? Now tell me what it is.”</p>
<p>“Alas, my child,” said John, as he stroked her waving hair, “and can it be that
    already you are seeking that which men chase from the cradle to the grave, that
    unattainable—the spirit’s rest!”</p>
<p>“The spirit’s rest!” said Millicent, while a sort of fear crept over her, she
    knew not why. “Uncle, what is that?”</p>
<p>“It is the good which all are seeking, and I know not if any find. I can but
    tell, I sought and found it not, long ago, Millicent, when all my thoughts were
    not devoured by one thought, and all my mind was not absorbed by one idea. I
    could have told you of the various shapes in which this desire of all hearts
    appears to human eyes, and how men struggle panting after it,<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7183-070"/> many fainting by the way; but now mine own eyes,
    looking ever inward on the great darkness that is on my soul, have grown as it
    were blind to all other sights; and I can only tell you what a shipwreck I have
    made, who freighted all my life upon one hope.”</p>
<p>“And where did you seek it, then?” said Millicent, with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>“In her love!” he answered, almost fiercely. He gazed for a moment fixedly into
    vacancy, then, pushing her from him, buried his face in his hands.</p>
<p>“Child, child, why have you come to awaken me out of that enchantment, the very
    surpassing sweetness of whose delusion makes the knowledge of its falsity so
    bitter? Why have you come to remind me that it was a shipwreck truly, and that
    the ocean of vain delights on which I seek to keep that shattered bark afloat
    does hide indeed most hideous depths, where I must sink and be engulfed one day.
    Go—what can I do for you? If the universal restlessness has<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7183-071"/> fastened on your heart already, I cannot save you
    from its fruits. They may not be poisonous for you—I cannot tell. You must abide
    your destiny. You will soon go out into the world, and your unpractised eyes
    will not so readily perhaps pierce the mask of outward calm which instinct
    teaches men to wear. It will seem to you that life is a gay and tranquil thing
    for many, when you see them dwell at ease in happy homes, but, trust my words,
    their spirit resteth not: wearily, wearily, to and fro, it wandereth, seeking
    repose. Soon yours will go roaming sadly with the others; it may be for weal or
    woe. I cannot guide or help you. I can but counsel you out of the bitter
    knowledge of my own experience: take heed how you make your rest on the hard
    rock of a human heart.” He laid back his head and wept in silence, for he had
    grown well‐nigh childish, through long‐indulgence of his feelings.</p>
<p>Millicent dared not further trouble him; she crept away far more thoughtful
        than<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7183-072"/> befitted sixteen summers. He had done
    a cruel thing in flinging that fear into her mind; yet it seemed to her that she
    had gained the knowledge of one great fact from this strange conversation with
    her incomprehensible guardian.</p>
<p>She had gathered from it this conviction, that the repose in which her whole
    being was to rest, and be as it were absorbed, the mysterious repose for which
    her spirit craved with a longing that deepened every day, was to be found in
        <emph>human love</emph>. It was natural that she should come to this
    conclusion, as it must necessarily seem to her that there could be no greater
    good than that for which John Forde mourned with the mourning of his whole
    existence.</p>
<p>Thus Millicent Grey prepared to begin life with one great mistake.</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7183-073"/>
            <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p><hi>SOME</hi> three years later a letter arrived one morning at the house Rue St.
    Michel, in the bonne ville d’Aix, where Millicent Grey had dwelt for so long a
    period. It was one of no small importance to her, for it announced the death of
    her father, and further contained the request, or rather the commands, of Mrs.
    Egerton that she should forthwith repair under suitable escort to England, there
    to take up her abode in the family of her aunt, according to the request of her
    dying mother.</p>
<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7183-074"/>
<p>There was now, however, an additional reason for such an arrangement, as Mr.
    Egerton had by this event become her lawful guardian, which John Forde was not.
    Mr. Grey, remembering on his deathbed the child on whom he had bestowed no
    thought in life, had sent for his brother‐in‐law, and entreated him to repair
    somewhat of his own neglect towards his daughter by undertaking the care of her
    and her fortune, at least until she should be of age. Mr. Egerton therefore
    added a few lines to his wife’s letter, to say that she would be expected as
    soon as possible at Rookcliffe, his country residence in ——shire.</p>
<p>In compliance with these instructions Millicent Grey found herself, on a fine
    evening in the month of May, after a rapid journey through France, on board of
    the steamer which was to convey her from Hâvre to London.</p>
<p>John Forde was not with her—he could not have accompanied her to her uncle’s<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7183-075"/> house, and his task was, in fact, completely
    over—he had fulfilled his promise—he need fear no mournful reproaching gaze from
    the eyes that were ever looking at him out of that grave—neither the dead nor
    the living Millicent would claim more from him than he had done; and he was well
    pleased that now that young, ardent life should be separated from his own
    apathetical and cold existence. He felt little affection for her, most lovable
    as she certainly was, so warm‐hearted and full of noble generous feeling, but he
    could spare no love from the buried mother for the blooming daughter, and his
    mind had become so completely enervated by his long indulgence that he was
    incapable of the smallest exertion. Human sounds grated powerfully on his ear,
    human sights were hateful to him, he desired an entire solitude, and such he
    knew he should have at Aix, when Millicent left him. He roused himself to wish
    her well through a world where he himself had been taken in a snare so perilous,
    and then<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7183-076"/> turned away to think of her and of all
    other living forms no more.</p>
<p>Millicent herself wept much at parting with him. She kissed his unresisting hands
    again and again, and almost felt as if the delight of going at last to visit
    this wonderful world, of which she had dreamt so long, were sadly lessened by
    the separation from her childhood’s guardian.</p>
<p>Yet Nanette remarked, somewhat maliciously, that her tears flowed quite as freely
    when they passed the grande statue in the Plâce on their way out of the town. In
    fact, at Millicent’s age, and with her loving disposition, it was impossible for
    her not to attach herself to the only person with whom she had shared her home
    besides her bonne,—but it could not possibly be a deep‐rooted affection, or a
    lasting regret; for John Forde had been nothing in her existence, monotonous as
    it was. After the first natural pang of separation was over it could make little
    difference that her eyes no longer turned occasionally on<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7183-077"/> the dull motionless figure of her silent
    guardian.</p>
<p>As for Nanette, despite her feeling of extreme mental helplessness after she
    quitted Père André,—despite her dread of English heretics and coal fires, and
    her invincible horror for some creature of her imagination which she was wont to
    denominate <foreign xml:lang="fre">bif staiks</foreign>, she would as soon have
    thought of changing her faith as of quitting her well‐beloved charge. Her warm
    attachment was fully reciprocated by Millicent, and it was really a touching
    thing to see those two, so different in age and station and in every
    circumstance of life, yet linked so closely by this tender friendship. So they
    stood together on board of the London packet as it smoked and panted preparatory
    to starting from the shores of France. As usual, humanity in its least
    fascinating aspect was to be found on deck. It is marvelous how speedily the
    atmosphere of refinement and polished courtesy, which counterfeits so admirably
    the virtues men<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7183-078"/> ought to possess, will
    evaporate from around a party of individuals, entire strangers to one another,
    who find themselves huddled together in an uncomfortable steamer, with the
    prospect of a stormy night. Nowhere, perhaps, does human nature appear with so
    little disguise. There is no occasion here for the universal and never‐failing
    politeness, which is so apt a representation of a pure and generous
    unselfishness; every one feels at liberty to occupy themselves solely with the
    real object of their solicitude, and one by one they are seen to ensconce
    themselves in their own cloaks and their own sulkiness, each man drawing on his
    traveling cap in its own peculiar style of hideousness.</p>
<p>There was the usual assemblage to‐night. There stands the young Englishman who
    might have been seen, a few days since, stalking like any heathen through the
    prostrate groups of kneeling worshippers in St. Peter’s, his spy‐glass in his
    eye; and his hands in his pockets. At his side yawns<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7183-079"/> another of our enlightened countrymen, who lately
    made an excursion to Athens for the purpose of shooting Greek owls; a happy
    expedient of which he bethought himself when he had exhausted the usual
    Britannic excitements of shaving his head, dressing like a Turk, and otherwise
    astonishing the natives, and who in that renowned city having been induced by
    the earnest entreaties of his valet‐de‐place to visit the Parthenon, looked
    around him on these ruins of mournful beauty, and taking his cigar from his
    mouth, listlessly inquired what they called this place.</p>
<p>Further on is the brisk young clergyman, who, with his aristocratic pupil, spent
    two months not long since in the Holy City, and employed the interval in falling
    in love with, and marrying the daughter of a missionary there established; the
    sentimental preliminaries having been carried on during an excursion to
    Bethlehem, and the declaration and acceptance having taken place at the foot of
    the Mount of Olives, such being the<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7183-080"/> habits of
    the clerical pilgrims of modern times. That sharp cross looking man with green
    spectacles and a huge note‐book under his arm, has been visiting the Syrian
    monasteries, where he has been treated with the utmost kindness and hospitality,
    having been nursed through a six weeks’ fever by the good brethren on Mount
    Carmel. He is now returning to England, where he proposes to enlarge the public
    mind with a volume of travels, which is to contain a sneering denunciation of
    the monkish superstition of his late venerable hosts; and further, such an
    account of their theory and practice as a total ignorance of all languages save
    his native guttural, and a fund of deeply toothed prejudice, shall enable him to
    produce.</p>
<p>In the midst of these various indviduals it was a pleasant sight to see young
    Millicent Grey, as she stood at the side of the vessel, looking over the foaming
    water towards the yet unseen shores of England, braving, with child‐like
    pleasure, the rough visiting of the<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7183-081"/> fresh
    breeze that blew upon her bright face, whilst her sparkling eye and glowing
    cheek told how high her heart was beating with its ardent hope, and with what
    energy and vigour she was preparing for the life‐struggle to which she was now
    advancing fast. She was at this time somewhere between nineteen and twenty years
    of age, and notwithstanding that she had great depth and intensity of feeling,
    as well as a shrewd penetrating mind, she was still guileless and simple as when
    we saw her listening to the mournful words, never afterwards forgotten, of poor
    John Forde.</p>
<p>No one was prepared to enter on the world with less idea of the consequences than
    Millicent Grey; in fact, her peculiar education had been of a nature to render
    her well nigh incapable of understanding the whole artificial frame‐work of
    society. She was essentially truthful,—it never occurred to her to speak
    otherwise than she thought, although her due share of womanly timidity and
    reserve prevented her from<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7183-082"/> communicating much
    of what she felt; and above all, she was accustomed to see things exactly as
    they were, without being in any degree influenced by popular fallacies or
    received opinion. She was joyous and lighthearted now, as those are only who
    have not tried their strength in the sore strife and conflicts that await
    them,—yet haply none would exchange the tempered gladness which falls on all,
    who have seen their guardian hope make itself wings and fly up into heaven, for
    that first sparkling buoyancy which hath no abiding charm: the one is like the
    dazzling lustre of the sunbeams, that fades before the clouds, the other, less
    brilliant but more pure, is like the sweet, tranquil light of the stars on a
    clear cold night.</p>
<p>She stood, casting her free glance over the sea, and already in imagination her
    bounding feet were treading the golden plains of her ideal future,—strange! if
    any one had suddenly mapped out before her eyes then, what that future was to
    be. Ah!<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7183-083"/> who, in the dawn of life, could look on
    such a sight and not turn sickening from it? Who that could foresee the process
    of their discipline would have the heart to turn and live? When the actual trial
    comes the strength comes with it to endure; when the piercing wound is made then
    flows the healing balm; and when the earth flowers fade, that lure us from the
    homeward path, how sweetly spring to life the blossoms of celestial bloom, whose
    fragrance penetrates the soul with soothing power, so that backward looking,
    when the journey’s ended, we can see how each sharp arrow has been winged by
    love. But in that hour of hope and bright expectancy, had it been given to
    Millicent Grey to look upon her future years, she had found it hard to resist
    the temptation of plunging with one bound into those boiling waters to hide
    herself within their breast from the wilder tempests and the colder blasts that
    soon would meet her in her life’s career.</p>
<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7183-084"/>
<p>She was not long allowed to stand indulging in her brilliant fancies; the bustle
    of starting was just over, and the steamer fairly under way, when Nanette came
    rushing up to her in a state of great excitement exclaiming,—</p>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Ma chérie</foreign>, we must be coming near to England
    now, for there is a <foreign xml:lang="fre">gros Anglais</foreign> come on
    board, and he is making inquiries for roast beef.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Millicent, “We shall be there to‐morrow. Oh, Nanette!” she added,
    turning round her beaming face, “life <emph>is</emph> going to begin now.”</p>
<p>“My dear young lady, I sincerely hope you may not be heartily tired of it before
    it is done,” said a strange voice at her side. She looked round hastily, and
    found that the speaker was an old gentleman, supported on crutches, who had been
    watching her animated looks with much interest for some time past. He raised his
    hat courteously as her eyes met his.</p>
<p>“I really beg your pardon,” he said, <pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7183-085"/> “for
    having taken the liberty of addressing you. It was quite involuntary, I assure
    you, but I was struck by your remark, which contrasted so vividly with my own
    state of feeling.”</p>
<p>He was an aristocratic looking old man, who had once been handsome, but he was
    entirely crippled by palsy; his countenance, which was by no means unpleasing,
    had an expression of great firmness, accompanied by a slight degree of
    irritability; he looked as if he were thoroughly accustomed to have his own way
    in all things, and his long‐protracted state of suffering had no doubt rendered
    him somewhat capricious in his desires. On the whole, however, he looked
    thoroughly estimable and benevolent, and for the moment seemed very anxious that
    Millicent should not take offence at his unceremonious speech.</p>
<p>She hastened to assure him that such was not the case, and feeling convinced, by
    the sort of freemasonry which exists in a certain class of society, that he was
        a<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7183-086"/> person with whom she might very safely
    associate, she readily entered into conversation with him. They sat down
    amicably together, and although of course, being such entire strangers, they
    could only talk on indifferent topics, yet the old man was soon altogether
    charmed with Millicent,—there was such a freshness and simplicity in her
    impressions of England, the new country she was going to explore, and at the
    same time so much depth in her observations, whilst her frank manner and ready
    smile were of themselves really very captivating.</p>
<p>“Why, you talk of visiting England and its natives as if you were going to
    inquire into the manners and customs of the Chinese,” said the old man, at last,
    smiling at her animation.</p>
<p>“Well, it is pretty much like visiting China or Kamschatka, or any other foreign
    country, to me. I have never been there since I was quite a little child; of
    course it is my native land, and I am quite ready to<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7183-087"/> love it very much beforehand, but at the same time I
    am rather curious to see it, because I expect it will explain to me a great many
    things which I don’t understand in the world. There is an immense deal of good
    sense in England, is there not?”</p>
<p>“Why, I believe there is upon the whole; and yet people do foolish things enough
    there. I could tell you of a few,” he added, shrugging his shoulders with a
    comical smile.</p>
<p>“Oh, I should not like it if they did not,” said Millicent; “but what I expect
    will prove so instructive to me is, that I am told the English all live upon
    system. In France, you know, they live <foreign xml:lang="fre">pour passer le
        temps</foreign>; and in Italy, I believe, their existence is one of impulse;
    but in England, I hear, they all think very seriously, and make up their minds
    what they ought to do, and do it. I believe there is system in everything—great
    systems for legislation, national education, and so on—and little private
    systems for the life of each person. Is it so?”</p>
<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7183-088"/>
<p>“ Well, I declare I can scarcely tell. Like M. Jourdain, who was not aware he had
    been talking <foreign xml:lang="fre">de la prose</foreign>, I hardly know
    whether I have been living on system or not; and yet now I think of it, I
    certainly have; and, what is more, I can tell you very distinctly the nature of
    it. My system undoubtedly is, to make myself as comfortable as I possibly can,
    at all times and in all places. With these withered limbs of mine it is not very
    easy; and yet, by the help of a good cook and pleasant society, I manage pretty
    well. Yes, that is clearly my principle. I must thank you for making it known to
    me.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the system of making one’s self comfortable is very common in England, I
    believe,” said Millicent, musingly; “but now, pray excuse me for asking it, I
    should like so much to know why you thought I should tire of life before it was
    done.”</p>
<p>“Simply because I am very tired of it myself,” said the old gentleman, laughing;
    “not that I want to be rid of it however,<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7183-089"/> oh
    dear, no!” and he looked round with a sort of terror, as if he was afraid some
    one would take him at his word, and relieve him of what was clearly a beloved
    burden; “But the truth is, that in early life I made one very great mistake, and
    I have suffered for it ever since.”</p>
<p>Millicent gave a timid glance of inquiry, but he shook his head, smiling.</p>
<p>“No, really I dare not, on so short an acquaintance, make you acquainted with all
    the secrets of my history. Should we meet again, as I trust, or rather, to tell
    you the truth, as I am determined we shall, I have no doubt I should be inclined
    to make you wise by my past experience.” </p>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="fre">Ma chérie</foreign>,” put in Nanette, at this juncture,
    who saw that Millicent was gaining some information from her new friend, “Ask
    Monsieur if that is the way in which Englishmen amuse themselves?” She pointed
    to where two of the passengers were engaged over a game at chess. “I heard them
    say, let us amuse ourselves;<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7183-090"/> but if that is
    their amusement, <foreign xml:lang="fre">ma foi! c’est que c’est bien
        lugubre</foreign>; they have not spoken one word, or smiled one smile, since
    they began, but they have shaken their heads, and nodded to one another with,
    oh, such a solemnity!”</p>
<p>Millicent and her new friend laughed heartily at Nanette’s look of horror, who
    clearly thought that the most serious of affairs in France was merrier than
    amusements in England. They continued to converse together with much
    satisfaction, till the arrival of a tall servant, laden with cloaks and plaids,
    interrupted them. He ventured to hint, that the night air was dangerous to his
    master, and the old gentleman was obliged to confess it was somewhat imprudent
    in him to remain so late on deck. He therefore took leave of Millicent with all
    the courtier‐like politeness of former days, and having been duly wrapped up in
    various mufflings, allowed himself to be carried off like a stout bundle, by the
    powerful footman.</p>
<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7183-091"/>
<p>We all know how speedily acquaintances are made in travelling; the frigid
    barriers which society raises between man and man are so completely thrown down
    when all are alike exposed to the same inconveniences, and it may be dangers.
    Who has not known what it is to swear an eternal friendship to the charming
    individual whose society has enlivened a ten days’ voyage in a wretched steamer,
    or to feel as unhappy as though one had lost one’s nearest relations, when the
    termination of a fortnight’s quarantine separates us from the family who shared
    its miseries with us? Millicent and the old gentleman met next morning as though
    they had been acquainted for years, and cordially shook hands with mutual
    pleasure.</p>
<p>They had a bad passage, and did not arrive at their destination until several
    hours beyond the usual time, There was considerable confusion on board, and the
    tall servant was fully occupied in taking charge of numerous packages belonging
        to<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7183-092"/> his master, in the course of which
    proceedings he tumbled several times over the active little Nanette, who
    invariably begged his pardon, and hoped, in an audible whisper, that all
    Englishmen were not to be so tall and so stiff. It thus happened that the poor
    old gentleman, whose infirmity rendered him quite helpless, would have been
    wholly without the attendance of which he stood so much in need, had not
    Millicent taken on herself the task of ministering to his comforts. She brought
    him his breakfast, put on his cloak, and ran after his hat, when the wind blew
    it away; in short, she made herself not only so useful, but so agreeable to him,
    that he looked as if he could not bear to part with her when the moment of
    separation came. He detained her for some time, when she rose to take leave of
    him previous to landing, and seemed uncertain whether he might venture to say
    what he wished. At last, summoning courage, he said,—</p>
<p>“I have a great favour to ask, and I<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7183-093"/> must beg
    you to excuse me if it seems an impertinent request. I trust my motive, which
    you shall most certainly know hereafter, will quite exonerate me. Will you tell
    me your destination in England? In short, will you give me your address at your
    new abode?”</p>
<p>Millicent was too completely ignorant of the ways of the world to imagine that
    there could be any reason to prevent her doing as he wished, especially as
    Nanette, whose bright imagination had already conjured up visions of splendid
        <foreign xml:lang="fre">cadeaux</foreign> which this dear, sensible old
        <emph>milord</emph> was to bestow on her darling, was inciting her, by many
    significant looks and signs, to tell him immediately. Millicent, therefore, gave
    him her address at Mr. Egerton’s, and so took her leave of him, never
    recollecting till she had left the steamer, that she herself had failed to
    obtain any information as to the name or position of her newly acquired
    friend.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p><hi>ROOKCLIFFE</hi>, the future abode of Millicent Grey, lay at a distance of
    some five miles from the nearest railway station, and it was late in the evening
    before she found herself in the carriage which her uncle had sent to convey her
    over the intervening space. Nanette, quite fatigued with the number of
    reverences she had made, with most unappreciated politeness, to the stoical
    gentlemen in glazed hats who had handed her out and in of the railway carriages,
    composed herself to sleep in a<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7183-095"/> corner, whilst
    Millicent, leaning eagerly towards the window, gazed out into the darkness, and
    tried to distinguish the different objects on which the light of the lamps
    flashed rapidly as they whiffed along.</p>
<p>She felt, as she had done throughout this journey, that she was being carried on
    to her destiny, that she was traveling, as it were, over the first stage of
    life, and there was a feeling almost of rapture in the excitement which thrilled
    every nerve, as she thought of the unknown future to which she looked with such
    anxiety. She little knew how, somewhat later, with most ineffable calm, we learn
    to lay ourselves down on the breast of that dark stream, and, with hands all
    humbly crossed upon the bosom, scarred with many a half‐closed wound, let the
    quick current bear us on and on, without an effort to direct its course,
    thinking only how deep, and clear, and smooth is the boundless ocean, to whose
    placid rest it bears us rapidly. Even the<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7183-096"/>
    locality of her future abode was full of interest to Millicent, and she
    experienced an almost child‐like pleasure in tracing the indistinct features of
    the landscape through which she was passing.</p>
<p>There is at all times a strange sensation in traveling by night through a peopled
    country; the contrast is so great between the lucid sky, where alone the remains
    of light are gathered, and the dark heavy earth, seeming to lie in sullen
    silence beneath its pail of shadows. The sight of those huge masses of building,
    whence no sound arises, but which we know to be so teeming with life, sentient,
    suffering, and mysterious, fills us with a sense of awe and, we fain with our
    dim eyes would pierce the outward matter to discern what manner of spirit is
    within.</p>
<p>How awful were a voice to come forth from each one of these dark piles of
    habitation, and proclaim the hidden truth of the living mysteries within,
    saying, “Here human love is agonizing; there<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7183-097"/>
    infamy and vice walk rampant; here despair is writhing in the dust; there
    cankering want hath torn affection even from a mother’s heart, and the child
    that asked not life from her is praying for its passing.”</p>
<p>But no such voice is heard, at least, except we question it; and so, through
    scenes which, could we witness them, would make us turn away heart‐sick to weep
    as it were tears of blood for our hapless brethren, we pass,—dreaming golden
    dreams, as Millicent did now!</p>
<p>The first mile or two carried her through a colliery district, and even in the
    dim light she could discern the miserable appearance of the miners’ habitations,
    which were in fact but a set of wretched hovels crowded together; their numbers
    were, however, so great that she rightly estimated the population as being very
    considerable. A bleak common of no great extent divided this uninviting part of
    the county from a tract of land where the scenery was of a totally opposite<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7183-098"/> character. Though still flat it was richly
    wooded, and beautifully undulating; in bright daylight it presented that fair,
    peaceful aspect so peculiar to the English landscape and to which the heart of
    the traveller returns with such a longing fondness amid all the magnificence of
    other climes. Not gorgeous Eastern skies, or Alpine mountains in their savage
    splendour, can ever be as lovely or as dear as the waving woods of England, so
    bright in their green luxuriance, with those quiet fields whose golden corn
    seems to have robbed the sunshine, and the voices wildly musical of rushing
    stream and sighing wind.</p>
<p>Even by night Millicent could distinguish some of the beauty of this scene, as
    the tall trees seemed to sweep past her, assuming a thousand fantastic shapes,
    and often obscuring the sky altogether with their thick branches. One object,
    however, before entering the wood, attracted her attention forcibly; it was a
    small church,<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7183-099"/> situated on the borders of the
    common nearest the mines, in a very dreary and desolate position, and which to
    her astonishment was lighted up even at that hour. She was the more surprised
    as, on approaching the village adjoining Rookcliffe, she passed another, of far
    more imposing appearance, which was entirely in darkness. Very picturesque this
    village seemed to be; very captivating the pictures of homely, peaceful life,
    revealed through the half open cottage doors, whence the fire‐light streamed out
    upon the dark road.</p>
<p>This village being Mr. Egerton’s own property, and all these simple villagers,
    peering from their lattice windows as the travellers pass, being also Mr.
    Egerton’s dependents, the coachman, sympathizing with that gentleman’s feelings,
    now causes the well appointed carriage to take a somewhat more aristocratic
    pace, and whirls it with noisy ostentation to the gate. The woman at the lodge
    is all ready to give it free entrance, and she curtsies in the<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7183-100"/> dark with due respect to the wheels, which grind past
    her feet with so close a shave that she is not very sure for ten minutes
    afterwards whether she has them all safe, On it sweeps down the long avenue; and
    a sudden feeling of timidity and of terror, she knows not for what, strikes
    Millicent Grey as she catches a glimpse of the stately house, that rises up
    massive and gloomy before her. She grasps Nanette’s little warm hand, and in
    another moment the carriage sweeps with an artistic flourish to the portico, and
    she finds herself at Rookcliffe. The door stood hospitably open to receive her,
    and on the threshold, in the centre of the blaze of light which streamed from
    the hall, Mr. Egerton was placed ready to welcome her to his house.</p>
<p>It was happy and striking coincidence, if this estimable individual was unaware
    of the pleasing picture which he presented in his benevolent attitude on the
    threshold, with his opaque person coming out darkly against the back‐ground of
    glowing light,<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7183-101"/> and the doorway forming a
    suitable framework around him.</p>
<p>He was a perfect type of the English country gentleman. There was such bland
    respectability teeming from his large glowing countenance, which seemed as
    though it were always reflecting the light of the fire after dinner, and such
    warmth and comfort diffused over the whole outer man, whilst his expression and
    general appearance gave ample evidence of the entire self‐approbation and
    complacency which reigned within. He welcomed Millicent with precisely the
    proper amount of cordiality, and folded her in an embrace systematically
    paternal; then releasing her, he offered his hand with that hospitable flourish
    peculiar to individuals in his position, and with a cheerful countenance, which
    seemed to say—“Behold with what self‐forgetting generosity I admit my friends to
    the bosom of my family!”—he conducted her towards Mrs. Egerton, who advanced
    from the drawing‐room to meet her.</p>
<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7183-102"/>
<p>This lady was the personification of dignified propriety, and of composed,
    resolute acceptance of all the advantages and privileges, physical and moral,
    which were to be derived from her station in society. Stately looking, well
    dressed, never varying one hair’s breadth from the routine of life, easy and
    luxurious, which is the settled system of existence for persons of her fortune
    and position, everything in her house, her person, her manners, and her
    religion, were arranged to meet the approving eye of the world.</p>
<p>Whether she were the urbane hostess, the careful mother, the mildly‐reproving,
    silently‐determined wife, or the benevolent dispenser of soup and blankets at
    Christmas‐tide, (these benefits being transmitted to her awe‐struck tenantry
    through the hands of a housekeeper in black satin and pink ribbons, who wore kid
    gloves in case she should accidentally touch any of the recipients of her
    bounty,) Mrs. Egerton still acted up to the one principle which guided her in
    all things,<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7183-103"/> of making a faultless appearance
    in the sight of her fellow men, and obeying to the very letter all the
    requirements of established custom, according to her rank and circumstances. If
    there were any one quality peculiarly prominent in Mrs. Egerton’s character, it
    was what is commonly called “proper pride,” that mysterious virtue belonging we
    know not to what faith or to what tenets, which is held in such esteem by those
    who not the less, through some subtle calculation of their own accommodating
    mind, firmly expect that inheritance of the meek which is promised in the
    doctrines they profess.</p>
<p>Millicent received another measured English embrace from this stiff but
    comfortable looking representative of good feeling, dignity, and respectability,
    who was further remarkable for a serenity of aspect peculiar to herself, and
    which emanated, no doubt, from the pleasant conviction that every thing she had
    ever done, said, or thought, was exactly as it ought to have been. She was then
    ushered into the drawing‐room,<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7183-104"/> having just
    caught a glimpse of poor Nanette, hurried off, with despairing looks, by three
    or four gigantic footmen, to the care of a housekeeper, awful in satins and
    stateliness, who appeared dimly in the far perspective. The drawing‐room seemed
    to Millicent blazing with light and full of people. She clung involuntarily to
    her uncle’s arm, and stood looking round from under the masses of her long brown
    hair, with the shy, timid glance of a startled deer.</p>
<p>Mr. Egerton presented her in due form to the various members of his family; three
    daughters, Anne, Fanny, and Sophia; two sons, Charles and Arthur.</p>
<p>Anne, tall and frigid, looking by no means so young as she could have wished;
    unpleasantly handsome, having bold features and hawk’s eyes, haughty and
    supercilious in manner, as though she had discovered some excellent reason why
    she was to consider herself superior to every one around her, and that, duly
    pious and Christianized<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7183-105"/> as she was, she had
    received a special license for giving pain to others by coldness and contempt.
    This young lady was wont to delight herself solely in matters altogether beyond
    a woman’s province, for she talked politics and philosophy with an assurance
    which had its desired effect on the majority of her acquaintances. We may
    further add, that Miss Anne Egerton also fully expected to reap the reward of
    all the virtues, such as humility, gentleness, and self‐denial, inculcated by
    the creed she professed with much Sunday ostentation.</p>
<p>Fanny, with indistinct hair and indefinite features, a small mind and a small
    voice, loving to sing small songs and to entrap unwary individuals into swearing
    an eternal friendship; all nerves and sensibility, continually declaring she
    must have sympathy; that she could not exist without it; that she was entirely
    dependent on her friends for happiness, and therefore, though she was sorry to
    be troublesome to them, yet really, constituted as she was, she must entreat
        of<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7183-106"/> them to sacrifice themselves to her;
    she must really claim all their time and attention; whatever their avocations
    might be, they could never be so important as the necessity that she, in her
    highly‐wrought state of mind, should have some one to whom she could tell her
    feelings:—Fanny fell into the common snare of imagining that she established a
    legitimate excuse for her caprice, self‐indulgence, and thorough egotism,
    (qualified, of course, by far daintier names,) when she affirmed that they were
    inherent to her nature, and therefore indispensable evils, not to be
    resisted.</p>
<p>Sophia, decidedly plain, short, thick‐set, and able‐bodied, having a worthy look,
    which was a species of moral livery to the peculiar line she had chosen; for
    this young lady had discovered that her especial vocation was the improvement of
    mankind, and to this end she laboured with a noisy zeal, no detail of which was
    ever allowed to pass unobserved by her numerous acquaintance. She pursued her
        call‐<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7183-107"/> ing without the slightest references
    to established principles or authorities; for, as she loved to say, when setting
    at defiance those before whose grey hairs she should have bowed in reverent
    silence, she had a thoroughly independent mind, and acted in all cases on
    theories of her own. Her conversation never was of the most lively description,
    for as she was fully convinced apparently that no one would be so much
    acquainted with her own merits as herself, she habitually undertook the task of
    doing herself justice, and discharged the duty with extraordinary fidelity. She
    was at all times to be heard quietly detailing her own meritorious acts, never
    dreaming that any merit they might have possessed was turned to veriest poison
    by such an open display, and in her daily descent on the village, armed with
    medicines and tracts, and stocked with severe, overbearing admonitions, she
    gathered up material for much complacent haranguing at her father’s luxurious
    table.</p>
<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7183-108"/>
<p>And thus she took to herself without misgiving the name of Charity;—that holy
    one, who with veiled face and noiseless steps glides unseen in the shadow of all
    who suffer;—fearing not, though snow‐white are her garments, to steal into
    polluted haunts; appearing, as though warned by some tender instinct, wherever
    tears are falling, or aching hearts are wearying to rest; through long dark
    nights making a pillow of her gentle arm for the throbbing head, and over many a
    rough and distant path, speeding with the angel words of pity or of comfort; but
    ever voiceless, silent, having no name, save in the prayers of the fatherless
    and widow.</p>
<p>Very charitable Sophia was pronounced to be; very estimable she was by all
    considered, and of late she had established herself as an authoress, by the
    publication of certain articles on the education of the aged ignorant, and one
    small volume, entitled “Hints to Bishops,” which, as Rookcliffe was a pleasant
    house to visit in, obtained some little circulation in the neighbouring.</p>
<p>The woman who writes is always in an<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7183-109"/> anomalous
    position; however powerful the motive which compels her to authorship, she has
    quitted her own sphere, and has taken to herself a vocation for which she is
    neither fitted nor intended, for her reasoning powers are weak, her knowledge
    limited, and her judgment swayed by her feelings; when once she becomes an
    object of public comment, she loses all claim to the consideration and delicacy
    due to her very name; but she does <emph>not</emph> lose the modest timidity,
    the natural reserve, which causes her a bitter pang each time that she is
    dragged before the public gaze.</p>
<p>She has gone beyond her own province, and therefore she must consent to belie her
    own nature. It would be a mockery to talk of shrinking from observation, when of
    her own will she has met the rude stare of strange eyes; absurd to say that she
    trembles to trust her own judgment or to guide her own faltering steps, when she
    who should have done the bidding of others, has come forth to govern and
    influence the minds of many. She has<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7183-110"/> quitted
    the stronghold of her womanly reserve and privileges, and henceforth she dare
    not turn, with all the revolting of heart she feels, from the personal remarks,
    the fulsome flattering, and the impertinent scrutiny, to which she has exposed
    herself; she has given herself as fair game to be hunted down for the public
    amusement, and she has no right to complain if the noise and turmoil of the
    chase fills her with terror, and with a weary longing for the unnoticed
    retirement which is her rightful sphere.</p>
<p>Sophia, however, had a fund of self‐sufficiency, which enabled her to pass
    through this ordeal with great equanimity; in fact, to sum up her character in a
    word, she was one of those persons who constrain free‐born Englishmen to wish
    most heartily that a little of the Turkish discipline were established in their
    country, and that the ladies, even without yellow slippers and the fear of sacks
    before their eyes, should be restricted to such spheres of action, and such
    topics of conversation, as are within<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7183-111"/> the
    bounds of their capacity and suitable attainments.</p>
<p>Millicent’s bright visions of a loving companionship with her cousins began to
    melt away very rapidly after she had received Anne’s chilling welcome,
    accompanied by a scrutinizing look which enveloped her whole person, and
    subsided into a sneer, and had also been subjected to Sophia’s hard impressive
    shake of the hand, who already perceived in her a victim for future improvement;
    whilst Fanny declared that she had been put into such a flutter of spirits by
    the stranger’s arrival, that she required the attention of all present for some
    time in order to restore her to composure.</p>
<p>But the introductions were not yet over. Mr. Egerton next presented his two sons.
    Charles, the eldest, was tall, rather good‐looking, and studiously elegant. He
    was refined, exclusive, and supercilious, and, as a matter of course, always
    absurd, and often disagreeable. He was one of those men who render life an
    intolerable burden by<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7183-112"/> maintaining that all the
    customs and rules of society, down to the most minute of unnecessary
    “convenances,” must be rigidly obeyed at all times and in all places, His
    favourite amusements were fishing and shooting, and otherwise endangering the
    peace and health of many innocent creatures; and he was further much addicted to
    the pastime of morally dissecting his neighbours, whose faults and follies he
    would skilfully expose and ingeniously discuss, with an air and manner which
    seemed to intimate that he did not in any degree partake of the same nature as
    themselves. Arthur, the last of Millicent’s new relations, was very slow in
    obeying his father’s summons to come forward and make her acquaintance. He
    advanced towards her, evidently with no good will, and he bent down his head so
    much that she could not distinguish his features, though she was struck with his
    peculiarly ungainly and clumsy figure. Arthur merely gave his hand in silence,
    and was turning away,<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7183-113"/> when Charles called out
    to him tauntingly, “Come, Arthur, this will never do; Miss Grey expects to see
    all her cousins to‐night, and you are leaving her to speculate mysteriously on
    the probable peculiarities of the countenance you are hiding so assiduously.
    Perhaps she thinks you are afraid to dazzle her by the brilliancy of your
    appearance; let me recommend you to prevent her forming too glowing a picture by
    allowing her to see that expressive face of yours at once.”</p>
<p>Millicent saw that the frame of the young man shook, she knew not with what
    emotion, as his brother spoke, but the next moment he slowly turned his head
    towards her, and she was startled by seeing a countenance more entirely devoid
    of all beauty than any she had ever looked upon;—a face so painfully and
    strikingly plain she could not have imagined, and she no longer wondered that
    her cousin shrank from observation. It was not possible that his appearance
    should fail to excite a feeling of<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7183-114"/> repugnance
    in the minds of all who saw him; and that he was fully aware of this was plain
    from the look of hopeless despondency with which he turned away. Millicent was
    full of generous feeling, and she inwardly determined that she would show him
    the utmost cordiality and consideration in all her intercourse with him; but in
    the meantime she had to follow her aunt to the sofa, where she was to spend the
    remainder of the evening in great state by her side. Here she was provided with
    some very strong tea, which she felt herself constrained to accept, in case she
    should distress the fat butler, who had brought it expressly for her; and then
    commenced a dull, heavy, commonplace conversation, of that aimless, unprofitable
    species which seems the only legitimate and established occupation for the long
    hours after dinner, and which always has seemed to us the dreariest waste of
    time.</p>
<p>Most thankful was Millicent when the punctual Mr. Egerton, who never varied<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7183-115"/> half a minute from the appointed hours,
    announced that it was time to retire. She bade her new friends good night with
    suspicious alacrity, and the feeling of depression and timidity which hung
    around her all the evening, was for the first time dissipated, when she found
    herself clasped in the ready embrace of her dear old <foreign xml:lang="fre">bonne</foreign>.</p>
<p>Ah! blessed human sympathy,—gentle, loving, kindly human sympathy,—what a
    marvelous treasure it is, without which, truly, we were poor indeed. It is a
    beautiful thing to think that to every living soul is given the power to
    alleviate suffering by that one heaven‐taught influence! too many ignore their
    high calling in this respect,—too many forget what a noble power they possess,
    and that the weakest, the most unworthy, the poorest amongst may be, as a
    minister of consolation, wearing to the eyes all dim with weeping the form of a
    very angel. For even if we have only words and looks to give, we must still let
    the look be one of tenderness and pity,<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7183-116"/> and
    the words, of loving kindness; and the aching heart shall throb less madly, the
    heavy eyes shall turn to the light again.</p>
<p>We are so closely knit together in this world, dust so clings to dust, that the
    lightest token of a fellow creature’s dear compassion is strangely precious to
    us. Shame on the niggard hearts that seek not to dispense this costly gift, and
    leave it withering beneath the cold, sullen influence of their indifference or
    their pride! They know not what an angel they are driving from their side when
    their selfish carelessness destroys the power of sympathy in their own breasts,
    for it is the one only joy this earth can give which naught can ever take away.
    They themselves may be most sad and lonely, the light of love and hope departed
    from before their eyes, and only that quiet gloom remaining which spreads itself
    upon this mortal life like some funereal pall, when the desire of earthly
    happiness is dead. Yet still more blessed far is so to pity and console than to
    enjoy the fond affection or<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7183-117"/> the care of
    others, and they may make themselves a sunshine brighter than the sunshine of
    their youthful hopes, in the returning smiles of those whom they have cheered in
    sorrow, whilst in their sinking hearts the tears of gratitude shall fall more
    sweet than dew, refreshing flowers that droop at even.</p>
<p>Let us not mistrust our gift, however weak we feel ourselves to be; there never
    yet walked one on earth whose path was not darkened with the shadows of many
    sorrows not his own, and to these he has power to minister, were it but with the
    kindly pressure of his hand, or the murmured blessing, or the voice of
    tenderness, that soothes the troubled spirit like the soft wind breathing on the
    stormy ocean.</p>
<p>Poor little Nanette had nothing to offer for her darling’s consolation, save a
    few cheerful words and a bright look of affection, but it was quite enough to
    dispel Millicent’s passing depression, and she was soon laughing merrily at the
    details of her bonne’s reception in the housekeeper’s room.</p>
<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7183-118"/>
<p>She was left alone at last, and feeling that irresistible desire for a few
    minutes of quiet thought, which so often takes possession of us at night, she
    drew back the curtain from the window, and sat down to gaze out on the still,
    fair landscape.</p>
<p>No one yet ever looked up into the midnight heavens, so intensely pure, so
    awfully serene, where the great stars abide in changeless beauty, like the
    glorious hopes that float through the calm soul of a saint, without feeling the
    rising up within them of a strange desire,—a terror, an uneasiness,—which they
    can neither explain nor define; no one, at least, who is yet chained by a single
    thought, or hope, or wish to this world, and the things of it. Some there have
    been, and are, who have so learned to fling aside the clogging weight of earth’s
    affections, that already their enfranchised spirit hath sought and found a home
    within those fields of light so far off and so peaceful.</p>
<p>Not so with Millicent, however; she was<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7183-119"/> still
    seeking the solution of life’s problem among the havens of this world, and as
    she gazed into the lucid skies, and on the dark earth stretching out before her,
    there crept over her that strange sense of loneliness which is an indwelling
    instinct in the heart, and which we feel most often in a crowd, in the presence
    of our fellow men, for it is the mysterious solitude of the spirit that nought
    material can ever fill.</p>
<p>It is this void and craving of the mind which causes men so to labour and to toil
    for the realization of their various hopes and visions; for they are ever
    seeking madly to hew out from the dust and clay around them an aliment for that
    vast spiritual hunger and desire.</p>
<p>Millicent had always felt most strongly the longing for that unknown good which
    she believed was to be found in life, else she knew not why the life had been
    given to her, and to‐night it seemed to come upon her with an overwhelming
    power; for she had, she scarce knew why, been disap‐<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7183-120"/> pointed with her first evening in her new home.
    During the long, monotonous years she had spent at Aix, she had ever looked
    forward to her arrival in England as the event which was to open up for her the
    treasure‐house of existence, where she might go in and find the mysterious
    riches that were to satisfy her heart’s desire; and now she had come, and it did
    not seem to her that the elements of which the Egerton family were composed,
    were likely to afford her much insight into the uses and purposes of life.
    Already, with the vivid imagination of youth, she pictured to herself a daily
    routine of inoffensive occupations, similar to those which had oppressed her in
    France, and her thoughts flew back to the conversation she had held with John
    Forde, when he told her that the thing she longed for was the spirit’s rest, and
    led her, by his ominous words, to believe that this rest, for which the soul
    feels such a dire necessity, was to be found only in human affection.</p>
<p>This conviction now re‐<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7183-121"/> turned with redoubled
    strength, as she felt the chill of that dreary solitude of mind; it seemed to
    her that to live in the life of another a necessary law of her being,—that, in
    fact, the very power of existence must decay within her unless there were some
    outer life to which she might link herself, and in which she might exist.</p>
<p>There was the foreshadowing of a great truth in this belief of Millicent Grey’s;
    it was the stirring within her of the instinctive knowledge that her soul could
    not subsist alone,—that, except in union with a Being not her own, even that
    immortal essence would expire and fade away. She struggling with the inborn
    necessity of adoration and worship which filled her spirit, and she prepared to
    seek an object for it in some form of human dust, flail and erring as
    herself.</p>
<p>She believed that her rest was only to be found in daily, hourly toil for the
    peace of some other,—that, in the entire devotion of her soul to the chosen
    friend of earth<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7183-122"/> would be its entire
    satisfaction, and, like all women, the craving was strong within her to find a
    support and defence for her great weakness and helplessness in some stronger arm
    and firmer heart.</p>
<p>So Millicent Grey lay down that night with a bright dream in her mind of some
    such loving protection and repose of self‐devotion; but she little thought how,
    by thus concentrating her whole faith and hope upon it, she was, in fact,
    preparing to stake her life at a single venture.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p>“<hi>MY</hi> dear Millicent,” said Mrs. Egerton, the next morning, as she sailed
    into the room with an air of consequential satisfaction, as though she were
    aware that an invisible herald had preceded her in the minds of all present,
    announcing to them the exalted position she ought to hold in their esteem, “you
    will have little difficulty in becoming acquainted with our mode of life, for
    when you have passed one day with us, you will know our habitual routine of
    existence as completely as<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7183-124"/> though you had
    lived with us for a year.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that every day in the year is exactly the same in this house: is
    there never a variety of any kind whatever?” exclaimed Millicent, in some
    alarm.</p>
<p>“Not any, I think, in the external arrangements, or what I would call the outward
    machinery of our existence,” said Mrs. Egerton, pompously; “each hour seems to
    have its natural and fitting occupation, from which we seldom vary. Of course
    life is chequered at all times, and with us, as with others, there are
    occasional circumstances which create change, though without materially altering
    the ordinary course to which I alluded just now. For instance, an event will
    occur in our family next autumn, which will cause us all a very pleasing
    excitement.”</p>
<p>Next autumn! no events until next autumn. This was dreary news to Millicent. Mrs.
    Egerton waited to be asked what this occurrence was, before she spoke;<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7183-125"/> for she held it to be highly unprofitable to
    do anything gratuitously, and she loved that even her words should be demanded
    as a favour, and graciously accorded.</p>
<p>Millicent was not slow to gratify her; she was much interested in hearing what
    was her first prospect of excitement.</p>
<p>“It is the arrival of my fourth daughter, Juliet, from the Continent,” said Mrs.
    Egerton.</p>
<p>“I did not know you had another daughter,” said Millicent; “I thought I had seen
    all the family.”</p>
<p>“All but this one, who is the youngest, and who has been passing some months in
    Italy with a friend. Until you have seen her, Millicent, you cannot understand
    how much reason, as a mother, I have to be proud. All my daughters are greatly
    above par; I am quite aware of that, but Juliet is something indeed remarkable,
    and totally unlike her sisters.”</p>
<p>“Is she, then, very handsome?” asked Millicent.</p>
<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7183-126"/>
<p>“You innocent cousin!” said Charles, laughing heartily, “how very plainly you
    have told us what you think of those you have already seen.”</p>
<p>Millicent felt she had done so, and coloured with annoyance at her own imprudent
    speech. Mrs. Egerton was content, however, with the implied compliment to her
    favourite daughter, and continued at once:—</p>
<p>“Handsome is not the word I should apply to her; she is much beyond that—she is
    strikingly beautiful. Charles, I appeal to you, if this is not the case, and you
    may rely on his opinion, Millicent, as he is peculiarly fastidious on the
    subject of beauty.”</p>
<p>“There can be no question that Juliet is singularly beautiful,” said Charles;
    “she is a remarkable person in every way: excessively clever, with an
    indomitable will, and the most consummate selfishness,—the whole concealed under
    a winning fascination of manner which I really believe has never<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7183-127"/> been surpassed. I have always thought there was a
    good deal of the tiger in Juliet. The smooth, sleek, beautiful coat, and the
    cold heart beating with its cruel purpose beneath it, is a very apt simile for
    that captivating softness and most fair appearance which gain Juliet the hearts
    of all who see her, and which hide the most subtle calculations for her own
    continual gratification.”</p>
<p>Charles piqued himself on his talent for analyzing and describing character in a
    graphic and energetic manner; he liked to treat individuals as a species of
    complex machinery which he was skilled in explaining, and he was rather pleased
    than otherwise when he had an opportunity of commenting on his nearest relations
    with the same supreme indifference which he was accustomed to manifest to the
    whole race of man. He merely slightly elevated his eyebrows in reply to his
    mother’s vehement protestation against the extraordinary manner in which he had
    thought fit to<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7183-128"/> qualify his sister, and
    sauntered away to receive his letters from Mr. Egerton’s hand, who was unlocking
    the post‐bag with a solemn and mysterious air, as though it were a matter of the
    first importance. All the family were now assembled, with the exception of
    Arthur; and Millicent began to watch their proceedings with the utmost anxiety,
    for Mrs. Egerton’s intimation as to the uniformity of their habits had invested
    the most insignificant of their acts with an awful importance in her eyes.</p>
<p>She marveled at the pertinacity with which Mr. Egerton kept them all waiting for
    their letters, whilst he carefully examined the address of each one, and at the
    vivacity with which he literally threw himself upon the ball and rung it, as
    soon as the clock began to strike the hour appointed for the family prayers.</p>
<p>“Pray wait a moment before you ring,” exclaimed Fanny, already too late with her
    request; “Arthur is just coming across the lawn; he will be here
    immediately.”</p>
<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7183-129"/>
<p>“I never wait for any one,” replied Mr. Egerton, shouldering a huge commentary
    (with which he daily confused the intellects of his servants,) and taking his
    accustomed seat. It afforded him the most exquisite pleasure to make this
    speech, for he shared in common with many estimable individuals a peculiarity of
    temper, which rendered it intensely pleasant to him to make little disagreeable
    speeches, which were often very cutting and humiliating to those whom he
    addressed, and which he flung at them from the high ground of his own
    superiority as the advocate of duty and propriety.</p>
<p>Punctuality was one of those virtues by which he succeeded in sinning comfortably
    every day, inasmuch as by his excessive punctiliousness on that head he caused
    the greatest discomfort and annoyance to his family.</p>
<p>Millicent walked to the window when prayers were over; and as it opened down to
    the ground, she went out a few steps to breathe the sweet morning air. She
        found<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7183-130"/> Arthur standing moodily near it. He
    seemed to shrink from meeting her, and she was again most forcibly struck with
    his forbidding appearance, which was the more evident in the blaze of the
    sunlight; yet there was a soft and mournful expression in his eyes which touched
    her, and a certain thoughtfulness in his countenance that is the sure indication
    of mental powers.</p>
<p>She went up to him with a kind smile and a winning cordiality to which he seemed
    little accustomed, for a flush of delight passed over his pale face.</p>
<p>“You have been taking a long walk, I think,” she said. “I quite envy you, it must
    have been so pleasant in these sunny, green fields, this morning.”</p>
<p>“It was indeed,” said Arthur, earnestly; “such an hour as I have passed might
    almost give one courage for the bitterness which the long dull day brings with
    it, at least to me,” he went on, seeming to speak to himself, and not to her. “I
    have been deep in the woods, where there was not a<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7183-131"/> sight or a sound save those of the fair nature, so
    glad and bright in its summer loveliness. I could breathe the fresh air with
    delight, feeling it was untainted with the sighs which, from a thousand bursting
    hearts, will have gone up to load it before the day is done, and brush away the
    dew without fearing that I was trampling over the spot, where some unnoticed
    agony had been poured out in secret tears.”</p>
<p>Milicent looked at him in astonishment; such bitterness of feeling was quite
    inexplicable to her, for whom the existence of suffering was a mere matter of
    faith; but Arthur continued like one thinking aloud, and well nigh unconscious
    of her presence:—</p>
<p>“I could not help thinking, as I walked through those green paths this morning,
    what a glorious world this would be if only the human mind were in analogy to
    that sweet nature; were it pure, and in hope serene as those unclouded skies,
    bright with the light of truth as that calm sunshine; giving forth its fragrance
    in thoughts and words, gentle<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7183-132"/> and lovely as
    the odours breathing from the flowers; dispensing its refreshing sympathy and
    intellectual aid upon the parched and drooping souls around, like the cool
    stream wandering with its life‐giving waters among the forest trees,—and so that
    Spirit, which is beauty in the material world, shine forth as goodness in the
    man. But how far otherwise in actual fact! There was but one mortal footstep in
    the woodland path this morning, and, yet a very load of bitterness was carried
    even then, through that pure atmosphere!”</p>
<p>He paused, and Millicent stood silent, fixing her large wondering eyes on the
    speaker; but suddenly she was roused by the voice of Charles, who had approached
    unnoticed.</p>
<p>“Miss Grey, I see you are mute in astonishment, from which I infer that Arthur
    has been imparting to you some of his peculiar theories; I therefore consider it
    my duty, for your future peace of mind in all intercourse with him,<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7183-133"/> announce to you that our respected brother is a poet.
    If you knew the world a little better, you would understand that this fact
    accounts for the very sombre hue of his existence, and for the fund of most
    melancholy information which it will be his delight to convey to you. For
        <emph>poet</emph>, in the present day, read—a well‐fed, well‐clothed, and
    highly discontented individual, who, having nothing to complain of, complains of
    everything, who conceives himself to be surrounded with the most bitter enemies
    in the bosom of his affectionate family, and feels himself desperately alone
    when seated at the tea‐table, where his anxious mother is handing him a plate of
    muffins. Awful instances of the world’s hollowness are to be found in the
    society of his unsympathetic maiden aunts, and the early duplicity of some of
    his school‐fellows leaves rankling wounds which time cannot efface.”</p>
<p>Charles was an adept in the sneering coldness and contempt with which, in
        these<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7183-134"/> our times, it is much the fashion to
    trample on the very souls of our fellow creatures. We doubt if many burdens will
    serve to weigh men down in their coffins so ably as the load of that murderous
    carelessness with which they wound the feelings of others, casting the blight of
    ridicule over things lovely and of good report, and destroying ofttimes in their
    fellow men that faith in the beautiful which they themselves have abandoned, in
    conformity with their levelling and sophistical creed. Millicent, however, with
    her fresh enthusiastic mind, was by no means disposed to adopt Charles’s views
    on the subject, and she turned to Arthur with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>“A poet! Oh, I am so glad! Are you indeed a poet?”</p>
<p>“I am so unfortunate,” he replied, in a low voice.</p>
<p>“Unfortunate! That is not the word to use. How can you so mistake your calling?
    Oh, it is a glorious thing to be a poet, I know nothing of the world;<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7183-135"/> but this, at least, I do believe and know: it is a
    noble thing to make your way into the hearts of thousands, and find an echo
    there to your own thoughts; a noble thing to be a conqueror, more than ever
    warrior with his armed force, and that by your sweet words only. Think what an
    empire of souls a poet wins to himself!”</p>
<p>“Miss Grey, you are rash, very rash,” said Charles; “you little know how
    extremely dangerous the writing species are, or how slight an imprudence will
    place you in their power. I can see already, with prophetic foresight, the daily
    arrival of Arthur, with a long roll of MS. under his arm, to which he will hold
    you bound to listen, after this incautious speech. I remember once to have
    mentioned that I took some interest in scientific experiments before the author
    of a treatise on chemistry, and the consequences were awful.”</p>
<p>Arthur turned hastily away as his brother spoke, but Millicent, whose gentle<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7183-136"/> heart was pained for him, called him
    anxiously to her.</p>
<p>“Do not go,” she said, “your brother does not at all understand what an intense
    charm there is for me in beautiful poetry. In fact, how can it be otherwise with
    any one! I am sure you do not yourself feel as you would have us think,” she
    continued, turning with a bright smile to Charles; “not to appreciate poetry is
    to undervalue one of the sweetest things this world has to offer us,—it is the
    very music of the mind.”</p>
<p>“My poor cousin,” said Charles, compassionately; “what a very uncomfortable life
    you are preparing for yourself, if you continue at this unhealthy state of
    feeling. Let me exhort you to reflect that an inordinate interest in any thing
    or person, is wholly incompatible with that calm equanimity with which we can
    alone, at all times, attend to our own peace of mind, and constantly promote
    that condition of placid enjoyment which is quite attainable<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7183-137"/> in this world if we know how to take proper care of
    ourselves; for instance, enthusiasm on any subject whatever is altogether a work
    of supererogation. It is most desirable to divest ourselves of it entirely, or
    it may be the cause of infinite trouble.”</p>
<p>“You are not a believer in your own creed,” said Millicent, laughing; “or if you
    are, you must feel exactly like a fish.”</p>
<p>“Like a fish!” exclaimed Charles, startled out of his elegant repose of
    manner.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Millicent, “the analogy may not have occurred to you, but it strikes
    me forcibly, that peculiarly temperate state of mind to which you think it
    advisable to reduce yourself is extremely similar to the remarkable coolness of
    the atmosphere which pervades the whole existence of a fish. You will admit that
    they are essentially cool, externally and internally. I think we might even
    define the exact species which such a character as you have described would most
    resemble. I<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7183-138"/> should say, now, an oyster—very
    calm, very cool—an oyster must be safely incased in his own shell, indifferent,
    we may believe, to the proceedings of the pikes and the turbots around; not
    likely, I should imagine, to be very enthusiastic, if even a mermaid were to
    sing by his side.”</p>
<p>During this speech, which Millicent delivered with much gravity, Charles turned
    slowly round, aunt fixed his eyes full upon her. He met in return only a glance
    of quiet merriment, and an involuntary smile passed over his own face.</p>
<p>“Talking of fish,” he said, “I think I shall go to breakfast.”</p>
<p>“And now,” said Millicent to Arthur, when they were left alone, “you will not say
    again it is unfortunate to be a poet.”</p>
<p>“And is it no misfortune,” exclaimed Arthur energetically, “to feel within you
    the stirring of a high and lofty gift, and to know of no channel or outlet
    whereby you may make it available for aught that is worth the seeking! Is it
    nothing to know<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7183-139"/> that you have a living power
    within you, which might subdue the minds of other men and mould them to your
    pleasure, and to know of no principle for whose upholding you would care to make
    the offering of your intellect,—or, rather, to have so little love for men, that
    you would never give the noble energies you feel within you, the needless effort
    of rousing them from the egotism and frivolity which makes them so pitiable in
    your sight?—Is it nothing for me to know that because of dire necessity my
    appearance,—my outward appearance only,—is most repulsive in their eyes, they
    have so shut their hearts against me, that I would rather my name were for ever
    forgotten; than they should insult my grave with the honour due even to the
    highest fame, when they made my life so desolate of all affection? Oh,
    Millicent! is it nothing to feel on all points more acutely than tongue can ever
    tell! to have an unhappy susceptibility, a miserable sensitiveness, which causes
    the light word carelessly spoken to fall upon<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7183-140"/>
    the soul like molten lead, and the cold look unconsciously given to chill, as
    with the bleak wind of some desert, and to know that if ever you sought to make
    these feelings known, and to obtain that sympathy, which is to the heart what
    dew is to the flower, they would but mock, and could not understand you?—This is
    to be a poet, and this is what I am; therefore I said well that I am
    unfortunate.”</p>
<p>Millicent had no time to answer, for Sophia appeared at the window with a request
    that Arthur would no longer detain his cousin from breakfast, which desire she
    expressed to him with all the harshness and ungentleness which is so common an
    accompaniment of that peculiar species of worth,—most especially understood and
    appreciated by the possessor thereof.</p>
<p>Arthur moved quickly on at the sound of her voice, but as he passed Millicent she
    showed him a flower, which she had just gathered, laden with the bright tears of
    the morning.</p>
<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7183-141"/>
<p>“Look,” she said, “how heavy it is with these refreshing drops; so plentifully,
    while I live, the dew you spoke of shall fall upon your soul.” He thanked her
    with a look of gratitude, and they returned into the dining‐room together.</p>
<p>Now, both Millicent and Arthur were right; the one when she said it was a noble
    thing to be a poet, and the other that it was a great misfortune, for one or the
    other it will be to all who receive that perilous distinction at their
    birth,—either a most glorious gift, or a most fearful curse.</p>
<p>It has not always been a noble thing to be a poet; it has been a most debasing, a
    most despicable thing, when the rare talent and the winning power have been
    given as ministers to falsity and vice,—when they have ignored their high
    calling, their most glorious vocation, and for the exaltation of sophistry or
    scepticism, have used that harp of angels, which was placed in their hands, that
    with it they might echo in men’s ears the songs angelic, and lure their souls
        with<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7183-142"/> telling the surpassing beauty of
    celestial spheres,—.when, in a word, the intellect of the poet has been made a
    slave to the passions of the man.</p>
<p>And again, it is in one sense a bitter misfortune to be a poet, for Arthur spoke
    truly when he said that others of temperament less highly wrought, can never
    understand the acuteness of their feelings, the intensity of their affections;
    so that it ever seems to them as though they fell among rocks and stones when
    they seek to make themselves a rest in the friendships or the love of earth.
    They are cast in a finer mould than most men, and therefore is the world too
    rough and hard for them; their imagination is too ardent, their tenderness too
    deep, their susceptibility too keen; the evils that are trifles light as air to
    others, wound them to the very soul; and because their subtle shades of feeling
    and of suffering can never be conceived or shared, their existence is a
    continual solitude.</p>
<p>But from this misfortune, for doubtless in<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7183-143"/>
    itself it is such, they may, if they will, extract a wondrous blessing. Since
    they cannot find repose in this world’s treasures, and truly never shall, let
    them up, and betake them to that high path, where they shall meet and hold
    companionship with the Seraphim, rich in love, and the Cherubim in wisdom, and
    let them make it their right joyous task to draw after them, with their alluring
    voice of melody, the souls of many that else would struggle on amid clouds and
    shadows here, and never find that Way of Light!</p>
<p>Millicent was so deeply impressed with her aunt’s remarks as to the extreme
    regularity of life at Rookcliffe, that she devoted herself to the task of
    watching the proceedings of the family on this day with much energy and zeal. In
    fact, Fanny declared it made her perfectly nervous to have those great brown
    eyes fixed on her at every moment, and to see them wandering from one to another
    with a glance of such animated scrutiny. Her abrupt remarks were<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7183-144"/> also decidedly startling to those who had led a
    common‐place, monotonous, objectless life for so many years with the utmost
    complacency.</p>
<p>It was not long before Millicent’s attention was forcibly attracted by the entire
    devotion of Mrs. Egerton and her daughters to the manufacture of worsted work,
    during the whole of that period of the day when they were not out of doors. They
    were somewhat confused by her earnest entreaties that they would tell her for
    what purpose, they were preparing those uncouth representations of bandits, with
    eyes of floss silk and all those flowers of unnatural dimensions and impossible
    hues. She seemed to think that since they plainly devoted the greater part of
    their existence to this delectable employment, they must surely have some hidden
    end; in view which would render it quite worth while, that they should have been
    born, educated, and carefully kept alive, by regular supplies of food, for this
    purpose only.</p>
<p>When their answers failed to give her<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7183-145"/> any
    definite information as to the ulterior use of their embroidered brigands, she
    remained lost in thought, with her eyes fixed on the basket containing the
    materials for this arduous labour, which caused them, as it were, to work their
    way through the ocean of life, like so many ships under press of canvass, and
    inwardly pondered whether the mysterious use of existence which so bewildered
    her was really to be found in that basket.</p>
<p>The gentlemen had disappeared altogether, but they met again at luncheon, and
    Millicent by a few well‐timed remarks succeeded in eliciting the nature of their
    employments in the interval. Mr. Egerton had been reading the newspapers,
    Charles had been seeing his horses fed, and Arthur had been wandering in the
    woods. At the usual stated hour the carriage came round to take the ladies for
    their drive; for as Mrs. Egerton informed Millicent, after luncheon, the
    remainder of the day was always devoted to relaxation. What they were to relax
    from, her niece could not imagine, nor<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7183-146"/> yet the
    exact aim and object of the two hours’ drive which she took with her aunt and
    cousins along the turnpike road. It was not certainly to give them exercise, as
    they did not walk a step; nor yet in order to breathe the fresh air, as the
    carriage was closed; and if it was an amusement it seemed to her even more
        <foreign xml:lang="fre">lugubre</foreign> than the game of chess which had
    so astonished her merry little <foreign xml:lang="fre">bonne</foreign>.</p>
<p>Millicent looked much astonished when Anne told her, as they passed through the
    hall, that the dinner hour was seven o’clock.</p>
<p>“Do you dine twice every day,” she said, with much simplicity.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” said Anne; “did you think we dined at luncheon time?”</p>
<p>“Why we certainly had enough to eat to serve us for the whole day,” replied
    Millicent. Anne only answered by shrugging her shoulders contemptuously. It is
    one of the singular facts of the present state of society, that the qualities
    which in theory we hold to be most lovely and desirable<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7183-147"/> are precisely those which in practice we treat with
    the greatest contumely and disdain. If one comes amongst us ignorant of the
    world’s ways, innocent because uncontaminated by the knowledge of many evil
    things, unlearned in the artificial laws and observances of
    conventionalism,—with what contempt and sneering ridicule are they met by those
    whose supposed superiority consists in the fact that they drag after them,
    through the crowds they love so well, garments soiled with the dust they have
    gathered on them in a many years’ contact with the world!</p>
<p>Millicent sat next Charles Egerton at dinner, and she was at first somewhat
    silent, not having been long enough in England to know what a very important and
    prominent place in society has been assumed by young ladies,—and how impossible
    it would seem, by their own showing, that the affairs of the Church, or the
    nation, should be conducted without their able interference. She might have been
    somewhat enlightened<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7183-148"/> in this respect by
    Sophia, who was in the habit of delivering a course of lectures to Mr. Egerton
    at meal times, which nothing but his deep pre‐occupation on such occasions could
    have enabled him to have endeared. Charles, however, who had observed his
    cousin’s eyes glancing with their look of bright intelligence from side to side,
    at last endeavoured to draw from her the nature of her thoughts, which he saw
    was likely to afford him some amusement.</p>
<p>“Pray tell us, Miss Grey, what peculiarity in our manners and customs is now
    attracting your attention. You should remember that you have especial advantages
    for working at least a theoretic reform in our social system, since all is
    entirely new to you, which is a second nature to us, and consequently you are
    capable of analyzing many of those anomalies which we should never observe.”</p>
<p>“Indeed,” said Millicent, laughing, “it would be an immense relief to me if I
    might talk openly of all I see, if I might<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7183-149"/> be
    as impertinent as I please, in short; and after all, you know, it is I who ought
    to be laughed at, for it is only my ignorance which causes me to be so
    astonished at English customs; consider me as a savage, and then I will tell you
    all I think.”</p>
<p>“Very like a savage,” said Charles, glancing at her sweet young face.</p>
<p>“But indeed, Millicent,” said Mr. Egerton, benignly, “I hope you will make your
    comments on all you see. I like to hear your fresh, unsophisticated
    remarks.”</p>
<p>Poor Mr. Egerton! he little knew all he was to suffer hereafter from the
    excessive bewilderment caused by these same untutored reflections which he thus
    encouraged in his niece. Millicent, however, had an instinctive deference for
    her elders, and she preferred addressing herself to Charles.</p>
<p>“Well, I must tell you that I am particularly astonished at all this machinery,
    merely for the sake of eating.”</p>
<p>“What machinery?” asked Charles.</p>
<p>“Why the whole affair; the whole ela‐<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7183-150"/> borate
    pageant, arranged with so much time and trouble. Look at those men, with
    immortal souls, for instance, going round the table with so many intricate
    evolutions, to which they are giving their entire intellect and thoughts.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean the servants?” he said.</p>
<p>“Yes, the servants; but they have souls, and intellects, and capacities, you
    know. Now, it is clear to me that their lives are devoted, as well as all their
    mental faculties, to the task of helping us to eat according to an elegant
    system. Just think what previous calculation and forethought they must have
    given to that symmetrical display of forks and spoons on the sideboard there.
    Who can tell what important discoveries in science they might not have gained
    for their fellow‐creatures with the same exercise of their mind otherwise
    directed?”</p>
<p>“It is rather a new view of the case,” said Charles.</p>
<p>“Then you know, it is not their time and life only, but ours also, that seems<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7183-151"/> to me, in this country, to be absorbed by the
    business of keeping in life. In reality, you know, it requires a very short
    time. In Provence, the peasants, when they are hungry, take a piece of bread and
    a bunch of cherries, and sit down under a tree to eat them; it does not occupy
    them much more than five minutes; but here it is really extraordinary how much
    time we employ in preparing to live. I have been counting—an hour to breakfast,
    another to luncheon, two or three, at least, for dinner, and coffee after it,
    another for tea and biscuits and wine and water at night, so that it is about
    six hours altogether; now, if there are twelve hours in the day, that is just
    half of it given to eating; seven days in the week, three and a half occupied in
    feeding our bodies; threescore years and ten for a man’s life, and he eats
    incessantly during thirty‐five of them.”</p>
<p>“What an extraordinary calculation,” said Charles.</p>
<p>“True, nevertheless, you see. I am very<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7183-152"/>
    untaught, very unlearned, and I am obliged to try to analyze life for myself.
    Life, that is, as it is understood in my own country, and by persons of my own
    station. I cannot let my existence slip away without ascertaining the truth of
    those occupations which absorb it. But in order to do so, one must see things as
    they really are, strip them of all borrowed clothing, and look at them in their
    true colours. Now it does seem to me that we are for ever making ready to live
    and never living. I have spoken only of eating; but when you add to that, the
    time given to dressing and sleeping, I do not think you will find that there is
    much left of a life‐time after the preliminaries are attended to. It is like
    continually reading the preface, and never coming to the book itself—always
    getting into the carriage for a journey, and never driving anywhere.”</p>
<p>Mr. Egerton looked bewildered, and Charles laughed; he glanced at his father, and
    then said:</p>
<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7183-153"/>
<p>“But you forget that you would deprive us of one of the greatest pleasures we
    have, if you denied us our comfortable repasts. Just fancy my father’s feelings,
    dining upon a bunch of cherries under a tree instead of sitting down to five
    courses and a dessert; you must remember that to enjoy is to live.”</p>
<p>“Oh, now you <emph>have</emph> reduced it to the very lowest level,” exclaimed
    Millicent.</p>
<p>“Reduced what?” asked Charles.</p>
<p>“The business of life! What, do you mean to say that this noble creation of man,
    this wonderful existence given to him, this fine intellect, this vast capacity,
    this power of thought—that all this is intended for no other purpose than that
    he, as an isolated being, should experience a personal and solitary enjoyment in
    the gratification of his appetite,—the very lowest and meanest qualification of
    his nature?”</p>
<p>“My dear Miss Grey, pray be cautious; you really alarm me. My nerves are scarcely
    equal to such startling denunciations. I<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7183-154"/>
    thought my remark very innocent and sensible; I can hardly imagine how you have
    drawn from it such a wholesale condemnation.”</p>
<p>“Simply because, if you would test the real nature of a principle, you must carry
    it on to the extremest verge to which it could ever reach, you must judge of it
    in all its bearings, and work it out to the very uttermost. I think we are very
    apt to hold principles in themselves intrinsically evil, but which, up to a
    certain point, seem to be innocuous, and because we are too well bred, or too
    indifferent, to go beyond that limit we never consider what is their true
    tendency, and so freely indulge them. You distinctly said that we were to spend
    half our short lives in eating, because it is a pleasant occupation, and I only
    put that sentiment into other words.”</p>
<p>“Sophia, my dear, how do you feel?” exclaimed Charles, evidently anxious to
    escape giving an answer; “‘Othello’s occupation’ seems to me to be gone into
        other<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7183-155"/> hands; the wig and gown with which
    metaphorically you have invested yourself for the last few years, in order to
    sit in judgment on us all, has clearly been transferred to the head and
    shoulders of our merry cousin here. Your essays on moral improvement were
    nothing to her pithy remarks.”</p>
<p>“Millicent’s ideas seem to me to be remarkably confused,” said Sophia
    sharply.</p>
<p>“Indeed they are,” said Millicent, very humbly; “I become more and more confused
    with every thing I see and hear.”</p>
<p>“But you have sufficiently proved to what miserable things our lives are given,”
    said Arthur, who sat on the other side of her; “will you not now say to what
    they should be devoted? how should the time we might redeem from the corrupt
    usages of society be occupied by us all?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that is the very difficulty which weighs upon me like the heaviest burden,”
    said Millicent, her eyes filling with tears from the intensity of her feelings;
    “I can see the<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7183-156"/> wrong, but I cannot find the
    right. It is I who should ask that question; for I feel myself, more than any
    other, ignorant and helpless; I feel the evil so deeply that I know, were I to
    die now, I should have been useless in the world as any clod of earth into which
    no mysterious flame of life had ever passed. Only in one sense do I seem at
    times to have a dim comprehension of what man might perform and might be. I know
    this world is full of misery, of want, of suffering, of deadly guilt. There must
    be a reason for it all,—there must be some dire evil at the root of it. The
    effect is dark and dreadful, the cause must be more dark and dreadful still; but
    be it what it may, it can be overcome, or at least combated, because good is
    more powerful than evil. It seems to me, though I know not how it should be
    done, that it were a noble task for the rich, for those who need not to labour
    for their daily bread, the intellectual and educated class, to rise up and make
    themselves a work in the succouring of their fellow men.<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7183-157"/> —It must be such au awful thing to suffer! Surely to
    labour for the removal of the load of suffering from this earth were a nobler
    system of life, than that which quenches the spirit, in a continued provision
    for bodily comfort.”</p>
<p>She paused, quite ashamed of her own vehemence, and no one seemed inclined to
    answer. After an awkward silence of a few minutes, Mrs. Egerton rose to go to
    the drawing‐room, muttering to Anne, as Millicent passed her,—</p>
<p>“That girl’s extraordinary education has rendered her totally unfit for
    reasonable society, or for ordinary life.”</p>
<p>“You will have some trouble with her, I can tell you,” was Anne’s reply; “I
    should not be surprised if she brought discredit on the family by some unheard
    of proceedings. She has no idea of the commonest rules of society.”</p>
<p>Millicent meanwhile went to sit down musingly, pondering within herself, as
    usual, how she could best reduce to practice the<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7183-158"/> theory she had just started, that it were a fitting object for life to
    wrestle with human misery; and still it seemed, as it had ever done, that for
    her, a weak woman, young and helpless as she was, there was but one means
    whereby she could have a part in so glorious a battle, and that it would be by
    concentrating all her energy on some one life,—a life beloved,—and devoting
    herself to banish from it, by her faithful tenderness, every shade of evil, and
    every cloud of sorrow. She knew not then that there are other ways and means by
    which, in all ages, timid women have come forth as dauntless soldiers to battle
    with mortal suffering, that universal foe; and how by self‐devotion they have
    found a wondrous strength and power, most foreign to their nature, and have gone
    to court the strife, in noisome haunts where most it rages, fiercely braving the
    pestilence, and all the fouler diseases of moral ills.</p>
<p>Millicent Grey knew nothing of all this, nor would she have been equal to it; for
        in<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7183-159"/> truth the sweet dream of human love, to
    which she had given up her whole power of hope, had fascinated her so completely
    that her eyes could discern no other light in life.</p>

            <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7183-160"/>
            <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p><hi>SEVERAL</hi> days had passed away, and Millicent, who was thoroughly grateful
    for the real kindness with which she was treated by the Egerton family, was now
    quite at home amongst them, and as gay as ever. It is true, they did not seem to
    her to take any very animated or very profound view of existence, but they never
    interfered either with her ideas or her actions, and left her quite free to
    choose her own mode of life. She also found no small pleasure in the society of
        Arthur,<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7183-161"/> notwithstanding the morbid and
    unnatural state of feeling into which he had fallen, from a total
    misapprehension of his condition on this earth.</p>
<p>He was as much bewildered as she was by the false lights and strange shadows that
    surround us in the world, and on which alone his eyes were fixed; but it was at
    least a mutual satisfaction to them both, to speculate together on all the deep
    questions which they most vainly sought to penetrate with their unassisted
    intellect. Truly for poor Arthur, misunderstood and little cared for in his own
    family, it was as though the whole earth had become full of sunshine and
    brightness when, day after day, he met the sweet smile of his gentle‐hearted
    cousin, and knew that he should hear her kind words of sympathy.</p>
<p>“I find we have a new neighbour,” said Mr. Egerton, walking into the drawing
    room, where the whole party were assembled one morning. “I have just received a
    letter from a friend, introducing to me<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7183-162"/> a
    gentleman who has taken Milton Lodge for the summer.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do tell us all about him,” exclaimed Fanny, the only one of the family
    sufficiently natural to give vent to the curiosity which all felt alike.</p>
<p>“Lord —— tells me,” replied Mr. Egerton, “that he is an intimate friend of his, a
    man of excellent family and large fortune. His name is Bentley—Colonel
    Bentley—he acquired no small reputation in his profession; but, poor fellow, he
    is quite disabled now. I have a note from him, saying that he is too great an
    invalid ever to leave home, but that he begs me to call upon him.”</p>
<p>“He is a married man, probably?” suggested Mrs. Egerton, carelessly.</p>
<p>“On the contrary, he never had a wife. I believe his nephew is his heir, and he
    will have a very handsome income.”</p>
<p>“Is he an old man?” asked Anne.</p>
<p>“Why, not exactly what I should call old; about my standing, I should say.”</p>
<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7183-163"/>
<p>“Oh!” Anne made no other answer than this significant monosyllable.</p>
<p>“He is, then, old enough to come into the list of those whose age entitles them
    to the benefit to be derived from my ‘Tracts for the Elderly,’” said Sophia, her
    calm, measured voice; “I am glad of it.”</p>
<p>“My dear Sophia,” said Charles, “you don’t suppose the man to be without
    education; I thought your essays were for the ignorant.”</p>
<p>“You are right as to my intention in the publication,” replied Sophia, “but I can
    assure you that nowhere have I found such ignorance of the peculiar principles I
    wish to inculcate, as amongst those whose station in life would have led one to
    hope better things.” She turned her eyes, as she spoke, full upon her father;
    Mr. Egerton, however, endured the glance without wincing, being hardened into
    indifference to the schooling most plentifully bestowed upon him by his youngest
    daughter.</p>
<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7183-164"/>
<p>“How I should like to see this old gentleman,” exclaimed Millicent; “he would be
    something new!”</p>
<p>“Well, my dear, I know of no reason why you should not be gratified,” said Mr.
    Egerton. “Colonel Bentley is accompanied by his widowed sister, Mrs. Hartley, on
    whom Mrs. Egerton must call to‐day, and you had better go with us.”</p>
<p>Millicent agreed, although she had hitherto always eschewed the daily funereal
    drive in the family hearse, when it seemed to her that they ever went with much
    pomp, to bury their superfluous time. She met Arthur’s glance of disappointment,
    who appeared to think there would be a sunbeam less in the woods if she did not
    go with him to wander through them, as was their wont nearly every day, and she
    murmured, as she past him, a few of those gentle, kindly words that come like
    sweet music into the life of those to whom is given that intensity of
    tenderness, which is a gift so beautiful and yet so perilous.</p>
<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7183-165"/>
<p>A short drive brought Millicent, with her uncle and aunt, to Milton Lodge. Mrs.
    Hartley was alone in the drawing‐room when they went in. She was a very old
    widow lady, most simple in manner and appearance, but with a face which to look
    on was to love. The mild blue eyes, full of that calm look of sorrow which the
    many tears of widowhood alone can give, and the sweet expression lingering round
    the placid mouth, all spoke so eloquently of the truthful simplicity and perfect
    unselfishness of her character. Very childlike was her gentle spirit, for to her
    no gift of intellect or power of mind was given, but the far richer portion, of
    humility and willing submission, and a heart that ever beat with warmest
    sympathy towards her fellow‐creatures. The deep, unchanging grief which, with
    the passing of her husband’s spirit, had entered into hers, had been, during the
    long years of solitude that followed, as a blessed angel sitting by her side,
    and talking to her ever with words of wisdom and love. </p>
<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7183-166"/>
<p>She welcomed her new acquaintance with much cordiality, but Millicent was at a
    loss to account for the peculiar smile which passed over her face as she took
    the young girl’s hands; her astonishment soon ceased, however,—there was a sound
    of some one coming along the passage on crutches, and Colonel Bentley entered,
    followed by a very tall servant. Mr. and Mrs. Egerton met him with all due
    formality, but their amazement was great when Millicent, bounding from her seat,
    flew towards him, and expressed the utmost delight at seeing him again.</p>
<p>“I told you we should meet in England,” said he; “why you fairly bewitched me,
    Miss Grey! I think you will admit I have lost no time in establishing myself as
    near to you as I could.” He then detailed to her uncle and aunt the acquaintance
    they had made on board of the French steamer, and further declared positively,
    that he had come to settle in this neighbourhood for the sole purpose of being
    near her. He said he<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7183-167"/> had just left the
    Continent, where he had vainly been seeking to recover his health, and finding
    his efforts quite fruitless, he had resolved on making a home to himself in his
    own country, which he designed to quit no more.</p>
<p>“I had no tie, however, to any particular locality,” he continued, “and after
    having met with this,—excuse me, I must speak plainly,—this charming little
    witch here, it seemed to me that life would be so greatly improved by the
    addition of her society, that I determined on making my new abode as near to her
    as I could.”</p>
<p>Colonel Bentley stumbled a good deal over the latter part of this speech, as if
    he were quite aware that he was not telling <emph>all</emph> his motives, to say
    the least of it, and Mrs. Hartley smiled gently whilst she looked with evident
    interest on Millicent. The Egertons were, however, extremely well pleased that
    their niece should have gained the friendship of an old gentleman so exceedingly
        <emph>comfortable</emph>, in every sense of<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7183-168"/> the word, as Colonel Bentley, and expressed themselves much gratified
    thereby. The same thought was on the minds of both, that it is not in novels
    only, that attractive young ladies receive unexpected bequests from elderly
    gentlemen of easy and pliant dispositions; such things they reflected have been
    in every‐day life, and might be again, Perhaps Colonel Bentley guessed the idea
    that was working in their minds, for there was considerable merriment in the
    recasting glance which he cast at his sister, but he proceeded to follow up what
    was evidently a settled purpose with him.</p>
<p>“Now, Mrs. Egerton, since I have been very frank in avowing the attraction which
    has brought me here, I hope you will kindly allow me as much of your niece’s
    society as she will consent to bestow on an infirm old man.”</p>
<p>“And an old lady scarce less infirm,” added Mrs. Hartley, with a smile. “I am
    afraid your invitation is not very tempting, brother, to such a spring flower as
    this.”</p>
<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7183-169"/>
<p>“Perhaps not, but I am very selfish; I should like to see this bright face every
    day, if I could.”</p>
<p>“And so you shall,” exclaimed Millicent warmly; “I know I may come.” She looked
    appealingly to her aunt, who graciously signified her assent. “I will come
    whenever you will let me, it will make me so happy.” She pressed Mrs. Hartley’s
    hand involuntarily as she spoke, for the gentle old lady, with her simple quiet
    words, had greatly prepossessed her. Colonel Bentley, however, was not yet
    content; telling Mrs. Egerton he had still a request to make, he begged her to
    allow Millicent to remain with him now, whilst they proceeded to pay some other
    visits they had in view, and they could return for her on their way home. To
    this they also agreed, and Millicent soon found herself, greatly to her delight,
    alone with her kind old friend, whom she seemed to have known for years. He was
    in the greatest glee, and looked as if he could have<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7183-170"/> danced round her, crutches and all. Had Millicent
    been somewhat less guileless, she might have seen very clearly that Colonel
    Bentley had certainly some purpose in view respecting her, which had induced him
    thus to seek her out, and now determinately monopolize her society; but she only
    thought of the pleasure of renewing the friendship which had sprung up so
    rapidly, and of the great relief it would be to her to escape to Milton Lodge,
    when the ponderous vacancy of the respectable and harmless existence at
    Rookcliffe became intolerable.</p>
<p>They had sat talking some little time, when Colonel Bentley rose and summoned
    Millicent to come with him to the library, where he said there was a treasure he
    wished to show her. She followed as he led the way, and opening the door he
    stood back to let her pass. She paused one moment on the threshold; one moment
    she stood there, turning round upon that old way‐worn man her cloudless eyes,
    with their candid, confiding gaze, telling so eloquently<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7183-171"/> of a spirit that, child‐like, knew nothing as yet,
    either of the deep joys or the deep sorrows of this life, whose depths had never
    been stirred to tell what mighty power of feeling and of suffering was there,
    over whose clear surface the wings of time had passed as over a calm limpid sea,
    where no blast of destiny, swift and viewless, had roused the lurking storms and
    called the human passions like foaming waves to life.</p>
<p>Thus stood she,—though she knew it not,—on the threshold of her youth’s sweet
    spring, from which she was about to pass for ever into that first summer of the
    soul, when the sunshine of earthly love shines upon it, and calls forth every
    latent power of thought and feeling, even as the warm, glowing beams draw out
    the fragrance from the flowers. She turned and entered the room, and with that
    one step she passed into a new era in her existence, where she never more could
    be, as she had been.</p>
<p>The first object which attracted her attention was a large oil painting,
    seemingly fresh<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7183-172"/> from the hands of the artist,
    which stood on an easel near the window; and as her eye fell upon it,
    immediately on entering the room, it seemed to her so strikingly beautiful,
    that, without looking to the right or left she hurried forward to examine it.
    The subject which it represented was somewhat singular, but so ably executed,
    that Millicent stood transfixed with admiration.</p>
<p>It was evidently the production of a mind of high refinement, and great purity of
    taste, whilst every line bore the incontestable stamp of genius. The scene
    represented a wild and frowning landscape, a very desert of savage mountains,
    where huge rocks rose menacing through mist and clouds, while deep precipices
    and chasms were lost in a portentous darkness. In the very midst of this abode
    of gloom and terror, stood one solitary female figure of the most exquisite
    grace and beauty; her robes of purest white, her fair head, veiled with her
    waving golden hair, her calm, and clear blue eyes, turning with a gaze<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7183-173"/> evidently of deepest tenderness on some
    unseen object, afforded a most striking contrast with the dark and terrible
    nature all around. That stern solitude with its inaccessible heights, and
    fearful depths, offered to the mind only the most dismal images of utter
    loneliness and gloom; but when the gaze turned on that radiant figure, on whose
    half‐parted lips the glowing smile told of joy and gladness, as eloquently as
    the soft eyes spoke of fond affection, all the promise and the hopes of life
    seemed embodied there, and she looked like the representative and dispenser of
    the whole rich happiness which earth is believed to offer man.</p>
<p>The picture was painted in the style of some of the old Italian masters, but it
    possessed none of that devotional character which mostly hallows those divine
    works of art, many of which were consecrated and inspired by prayer;—far other
    was the spirit breathing through this splendid painting. Ethereal‐looking and
    lovely as was that<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7183-174"/> figure, standing forth so
    white and fair amid the gloom—it was no angel, but a mere woman, beautiful with
    the beauty at which the expectant worms mock,—radiant with the ardour of earthly
    hopes, and on some earthly object fixing that tender and speaking glance.</p>
<p>Millicent gazed at it long, silent, and motionless, then, drawing a long breath,
    she exclaimed,‐</p>
<p>“How wonderfully beautiful!”</p>
<p>Instantly there was a slight movement behind her, as of one drawing near; she
    turned, and her gaze fell upon that face whose image was to pass before her
    spirit when her eyes were closing for ever on the light of day,—and a voice,
    whose echo was to linger on her heart, when already with a dull faint beating it
    was fluttering beneath. the hand of death, came sounding on her ear.</p>
<p>“So sincere a tribute as yours is worth a world’s praise.”</p>
<p>“Why, Stephen, I did not know you<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7183-175"/> were here
    when I brought my charming little friend to see your picture, but I am glad you
    have had such an honest proof of the admiration it deserves;” said Colonel
    Bentley. “And now, Miss Grey, I must introduce the artist to you as my nephew,
    Stephen Aylmer; he is my sole surviving relative, besides my sister, so I must
    pray you to be very friendly with him.”</p>
<p>Millicent offered her hand to Aylmer with her usual frankness, and again looked
    up into the noble face that was bent down to her, thinking as she did so that
    she had never seen a countenance which bore so plainly the impress of a fine
    mind, and an elevated character, and wondering at the singular charm of the
    sweet smile that tempered so well his gravity of thought.</p>
<p>Stephen Aylmer had received many rare gifts wherewith to make himself a noble
    destiny on earth, if so he willed it. Of these the most powerful was, perhaps,
    the great fascination which he possessed over the minds of others. His
        personal<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7183-176"/> appearance, his genius, his kind
    and generous disposition, all united to give him an irresistible ascendancy with
    whomsoever he would. He was a man of great talent and of strong feelings. In
    this age, when knowledge is around us like the blaze of the noonday sun, the
    light of truth fails not to pass before the eyes of all;—it passes immutable,
    unchanging; and the influence of its pure beams on the soul of each is either
    like the power of the sun‐rays when, stealing over the kindly grateful soil,
    they cause its hidden treasures to germinate, and bear much fruit, and many
    fragrant flowers; or like those same rays sweeping over the cold deceitful
    waters of the sea that gather not from them a spark of warmth or of life. Now
    the proud, strong spirit of Stephen Aylmer had met the flood of light divine as
    the chill waters of the ocean meet the sun. He acknowledged the glory and the
    surpassing beauty of that moral brightness; he no more doubted whence came those
    living beams, than men could doubt that the<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7183-177"/>
    sunshine streams from heaven. Yet it penetrated not deeper into his life and
    heart, than the earthly light beneath the cold dark billows. He held the faith
    as an hereditary possession like his name, or the unstained honour of his
    family, but he yielded obedience to none, save his own will; he ruled himself
    solely by the dictates of his own understanding. He abhorred vice, not because
    the voice of truth had proclaimed it abhorrent, but because he himself conceived
    it low and degrading, unworthy the possible elevation of the human nature.
    Nevertheless the soul of man demands a worship; it cannot exist without adoring,
    and if it bow not to the Supreme Perfection, it will prostrate itself before
    some outward expression of that Unseen Power. Now, that which to Stephen Aylmer
    supplied the place of a legitimate adoration was the worship of the
    Beautiful;—he gave up his life to seek and cherish it, wherever it might be
    found,—in the scenes of nature, in the human face, and in the higher works of<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7183-178"/> art. He adored also the moral beauty of
    goodness; he sought it in others, he cultivated it in himself, but he rested in
    his own proud independence of mind alone for the attainment of all virtue and
    excellence. He would not be degraded, he would not be corrupted by evil, and
    therefore he <emph>would</emph> be generous, honourable, unstained by any vice;
    not because he was so commanded, but because he so willed. He had lived nearly
    thirty years when he first looked on Millicent Grey, and as yet his unsound
    theory had apparently upheld him in all rectitude and goodness;—no unworthy
    action had ever sullied his fair fame. He was honoured and beloved for his
    rectitude, and for his amiable and noble disposition, whilst the admiration
    excited by his talents and genius seemed only to render him more kind and gentle
    to all.</p>
<p>He believed himself very secure on the high ground he had chosen, but he knew not
    what ungovernable passions lay hid in the depth of his soul, which no human
    will, not<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7183-179"/> even his who called himself master
    of his own spirit, could restrain. It was strange that these had never been
    called forth in any shape; but his life had been very bright and tranquil. He
    had devoted his time almost entirely to the cultivation of the fine arts; he had
    lived much in Italy, enjoying the free poetical existence of the artist, which
    is too wandering and gay to admit the exercise of any very strong feelings.
    Aylmer had never felt a deep or powerful affection, not because he had not the
    capacity for it, but because he had it too intensely,—his ideal had never yet
    been found. Many a fair face had haunted his dreams from time to time, but no
    attachment had ever taken root in his heart. He knew not what it was either to
    hate or to love, therefore had he easily maintained that calm dignity of
    excellence. But too surely, yet a little while, and some rushing wind would come
    to blow to flame the smouldering fire of his soul’s deep passions, and then
    would he find that the fair structure he had built up, the noble<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7183-180"/> character and blameless life, were set on a
    foundation of shifting sand.</p>
<p>Aylmer was altogether dependent on Colonel Bentley, being the only child of his
    sister, who had married a ruined man, and died in the same year as her husband,
    whilst he was quite a child. They left nothing but debts to a large amount,
    which Colonel Bentley paid, and adopted his nephew, designing to make him his
    heir. This was, however, entirely a matter of choice; he could dispose of his
    fortune as he would, and Stephen had no legal claim upon him. This state of
    utter dependence would doubtless have been very galling to the young man but for
    the excessive affection shown him by his uncle; their wishes were never in
    opposition, for Colonel Bentley so habitually indulged him in everything, that
    Aylmer was always ready on his part to make occasional sacrifices to his uncle’s
    desires.</p>
<p>In the present instance, Stephen had returned from the Continent to reside at<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7183-181"/> Milton Lodge, in accordance with Colonel
    Bentley’s request, although he had only partially revealed to him his reasons
    for requiring it. He had told him, what was the case, that he was exceedingly
    anxious he should marry, but he had not communicated the more important fact,
    that he had already fixed on the person he should wish him to choose.</p>
<p>Colonel Bentley had never ceased to regret his own deficiency in this respect; as
    a young man, being fond of a free and merry life, he had rather avoided any
    family <corr>encumbrances</corr>, but when, later, he found himself a helpless cripple, condemned
    almost entirely to solitude, and delivered over to the care of hired attendants,
    it was then that he longed for some gentle wife to be his faithful companion,
    ministering to all his wants and comforts. The one great mistake which he told
    Millicent he had made in youth, was simply his having failed to marry when it
    was in his power. And certainly his lamentations were not<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7183-182"/> without reason, as Stephen was much absent, and Mrs.
    Hartley could only leave her children, who were dispersed in the world, at rare
    intervals, in order to be with him.</p>
<p>It was not unnatural, under these circumstances, that he should feel very
    anxious, since he could no longer remedy his own mistake, to prevent his nephew
    falling into the same, both because he really believed it essential to Aylmer’s
    happiness that he should marry, and also because, as he fully intended that his
    favourite nephew should always reside with him, he would secure in his new
    niece, a useful companion, whose duty it would be to perform for him all those
    little offices, which belong especially to a woman’s province.</p>
<p>Stephen Aylmer possessed much of the old chivalrous feeling respecting women, and
    his bearing towards them was full of grace and gentleness, although no one could
    be more essentially manly in his habits and address. Millicent felt the charm of
    his manner during the conversation which en‐<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7183-183"/>
    sued between them, and he seemed pleased and amused at the lively and novel view
    she took of most subjects.</p>
<p>They had advanced considerably in their acquaintance when Mr. and Mrs. Egerton
    arrived to reclaim their niece. They did not alight, and as Millicent rose to go
    to the carriage, she paused once again before the picture, and gazed intently on
    it: then she looked up with a bright smile to Aylmer, and quoted the words of
    the poet:</p>
<quote>
    <l>“Oh, that a desert were my dwelling‐place,</l>
    <l>With one fair spirit for my minister.”</l>
</quote>
<p>His smile answered hers.</p>
<p>“You are quite right,—you have caught the idea. I have endeavoured to embody on
    that canvass my ideal of beauty,—of such beauty as, beaming from one human face,
    could make the savage desert, indeed, a dwelling place of light and joy.”</p>
<p>“I doubt, however, if anything so beautiful does exist in human shape.”</p>
<p>“I almost begin to fear it,—at least, I<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7183-184"/> fear
    that my ideal exists not,—for I do not consider this in any degree a successful
    expression of my own vision.”</p>
<p>“What must your ideal be, if this is not beautiful enough?” exclaimed
    Millicent.</p>
<p>“Ideals indeed!” shouted Colonel Bentley, shaking his crutch impatiently. “I have
    no patience with your visionary pieces of perfection; they are all very well in
    theory, but I can tell you they would be most useless, uncomfortable companions.
    Just fancy asking that ethereal‐looking; individual in the white gown, whom you
    have painted there, to come and shake up one’s cushion, or bring one a
    footstool? Take my word for it, Stephen, if your seraphic vision were to come
    flying in just now, for she certainly could not walk, along with some active,
    merry, sweet tempered little being, of nature’ s own making, you would soon bow
    your ideal out, and tell the footman to show her the window, that she might make
    a poetical exit, while you sat down to your dinner with a good honest<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7183-185"/> bit of flesh and blood. No, no,—I have no fancy for
    your ideals. I dare say you have got one, too, Miss Grey,—a very fierce and
    interesting brigand, with black hair and a mystery over his birth; but, my dear
    little love, let me assure you, you would not be at all comfortable, making tea
    for a brigand, especially if he took it with his mask on.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think I should, indeed,” said Millicent, laughing heartily; “I am not
    famous for courage; but, in the meantime, I have an uncle and aunt waiting for
    me, who are very real and substantial, and not at all visionary; so I fear I
    must go.”</p>
<p>“Well, promise to come back every day.”</p>
<p>“I will, indeed, if I can,” said Millicent; and she went to the carriage,
    accompanied by Aylmer. Mr. and Mrs. Egerton were extremely gracious to him, and
    hoped to see him often; and so terminated the visit to which Millicent Grey
    looked back when on her death bed, as the crisis of her destiny.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><hi>MR. AYLMER</hi> called at Rookcliffe next day, and having paid a visit of
    considerable length, he was about to take leave, when the horses were brought
    round for the Egertons and their cousin, who were going to ride; and Mrs.
    Egerton proposed, as he had come on horseback, that he should join the party. To
    this he willingly agreed, and they were soon on their way to the common, through
    which Millicent had passed on the night of her arrival. They were all there<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7183-187"/> excepting, of course, Mr. and Mrs. Egerton,
    and Sophia, who had passed out of the hall‐door, in the most elaborate manner,
    with a basket of Tracts, just as the others were preparing to mount; and having
    anxiously waited to be asked where she was going, which she at last happily
    accomplished, she replied that the curate of the village had greatly unsettled
    the mind of one of <emph>her</emph> flock, and that she was now going to warn
    him that he must on no account attend to that gentleman’s advice, but to her own
    instructions only.</p>
<p>Millicent Grey had never been face to face with the poor—that dark, that awful,
    that mysterious portion of this world’s vast system had never passed before her
    eyes, that one black page in earth’s history, which changes not from age to age,
    bearing ever the same record in the single word <emph rend="sc">MISERY</emph>,
    had not as yet been unrolled to her gaze. She was like many others, who live
        and<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7183-188"/> die in this country, with its millions
    of paupers, without ever having looked on poverty.</p>
<p>They would think you mocked them if you told them so. They would say that surely
    they had often seen the wretched beggars in the street, and that yearly they
    gave a large portion of their income to charitable institutions. It may be so;
    they know not what is poverty. Have they ever gone to pass days and nights in
    attendance on the sick and dying, amongst those crowds of miserable wretches who
    herd together in damp, black cellars, to watch there all the various shapes and
    stages of the agony of want?</p>
<p>Have they seen them seeking to forget in sleep the raging pangs of
    hunger,—dreaming of food, and waking to curse life, and weep for death?</p>
<p>Have they heard that cry, simple, familiar, daily ascending—but into which is<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7183-189"/> gathered the extreme of mortal anguish—“My
    children are perishing for want of food, and I have none to give?”</p>
<p>Have they seen parents blessing the pestilence which sweeps away the babes they
    have carried on their bosom? or bending over them when dying in the lingering
    horror of starvation, and feeling all the strong love returning, so that they
    would yet retain them even to their life of misery, well knowing one morsel—one
    little morsel—might redeem them from the jaws of death—and yet that morsel is
    unattainable, and they expire?</p>
<p>Have they seen the man with the strong life struggling in him, lying before the
    stores of food, where all that could tempt the appetite is separated from him by
    the frail, clear glass?—have they thought on his superhuman virtue, who
    stretches not out his hand to take the means of life, when his nature was
    revolting against the death<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7183-190"/> of exhaustion? It
    were a crime, no doubt, for which men who fare sumptuously every day would sit
    in judgment on him and condemn him, with stern rebuke, to punishment. A crime,
    truly; but in whom? In those, surely, who withhold, as much as in the maddened
    wretch who steals.</p>
<p>They have not known poverty, they have not seen it, till they have so felt it
    that they turn in horror from their own luxurious boards and look in fear on the
    comfort of their homes—asking themselves by what right they enjoy one item of
    superfluity whilst at the door of their very souls a million fellow creatures
    stand knocking, saying, “Give us food, give us food, we perish!”</p>
<p>Millicent knew nothing of all this, yet she had learned theoretically that there
    was want and sorrow in this world, and she often wondered what it was that she
    felt so repugnant in Sophia Egerton’s charity.</p>
<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7183-191"/>
<p>She had a vision of Charity such as we have spoken of already, one whose feet she
    would have kissed, could she have met her stealing in secret through the dark
    haunts of wretchedness, so gentle, so humble, so loving—none knowing whither she
    goes, or whence she comes—braving the contagious sickness of all the noisome
    atmosphere, cold and heat, fatigue and long unrest, if only her presence can
    give comfort; enduring the rude, unholy words of evil men, the sights and sounds
    of blasphemy and vice, nor heeding that the delicately nurtured might shun her
    after, lest she suffer by the contact. Some such vision as this had Millicent;
    yet she was always angry at herself for not sufficiently appreciating Sophia’s
    exertions.</p>
<p>The truth was, that Millicent Grey, quick sighted as she certainly was in
    detecting many of the popular fallacies and familiar little sins which, like so
    many respected<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7183-192"/> family friends, are everywhere
    received and cherished in society, had not yet distinguished between the meek,
    voiceless, all‐enduring charity which, heaven be praised, has a wide though
    hidden dominion in our lands, and a certain species of convivial benevolence,
    quite peculiar to England, and most universal there.</p>
<p>There is a whole system of sociable, open‐mouthed alms‐giving, which is most
    intensely pleasant to human nature, and especially to that nature as developed
    in the inhabitants of Great Britain.</p>
<p>Religion being essential to respectability among us, we are obliged to dress up
    our pleasures in a monk’s cowl and gown, before we can go out walking with them
    in the eyes of the world.</p>
<p>Now nothing looks the religious so well as that busy, excited, talkative charity,
    that drives to cottage doors in a carriage filled with sympathizing friends, and
        holds<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7183-193"/> meetings to discuss soup kitchens
    and blanket clubs, ever comparing notes with others equally zealous, as to the
    amount of good that has been done,—promoting in every possible way the
        <emph>public</emph> performance of that duty, which is to be accomplished by
    the left hand unknown to the right, and talking as openly of their charitable
    prowess as if they were recounting their misdoings in self‐imposed penance.</p>
<p>Millicent had not quite understood this as yet, so she looked thoughtfully after
    Sophia and her basket, till the voice of Aylmer at her side recalled her from
    her reflections.</p>
<p>Aylmer’s conversation was striking and full of talent: he waged war against all
    common places, and when he was conversing with any one who could understand him,
    he invariably chose subjects of some depth and importance, on which he could
    exercise the powers of his fine mind. This was great enjoyment to Millicent, who
    could never be content with<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7183-194"/> the surface of
    things. She was perpetually diving to the bottom of wells in search of truth,
    and she was quite happy when she found any one willing to dive along with her,
    instead of passing by on the beaten path, as most of her present friends did,
    who were content, as she said, to cast a glance of pity on her so perplexed in
    her well, whilst they themselves followed the road, right or wrong, which others
    chalked out for them, and wondered what made her take so much trouble.</p>
<p>Aylmer was pleased with her frank simple manner, and amused by her lively
    remarks. The conversation was so interesting that it was not until they had
    ridden several miles that Millicent remembered she had not addressed a word to
    Arthur, who was riding silently by her side.</p>
<p>There was a great change in Arthur Egerton, since the sweet face of his cousin
    had come beaming in upon his dark life like<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7183-195"/> a
    star: the immense ambition which so long had sounded in his heart like thunder,
    still was echoing there, for it was the voice of the divine gift within him,
    that cried out to be employed on the high mission for which alone the poetic
    spark of heavenly fire was ever sent to dwell in mortal clay; but it had changed
    its nature. We have said that this young poet had never understood his calling,
    because he had not comprehended man’s immortal destiny, wherein lies the
    solution of all this life’s bewilderment, and he was still in the mist of his
    sorrowful ignorance; but it often happens to those who have never filled the
    void of their own spirit with the great name of truth, that when, for the first
    time, a strong affection of earth comes swelling up into their soul, they
    conceive that their whole being shall be content therewith, and that around this
    alone, may revolve all their thoughts, and longings, and desires. The conviction
    of this<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7183-196"/> error comes best and soonest in the
    full accomplishment of their desires, for satiety is the deepest test of the
    true value of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Whilst the treasure is unattainable, however, it seems mostly to suffice for the
    heart of man,—and it was so now with Arthur. He had never yet stilled the raging
    fire of his ambitious yearnings, by giving the fruit of his great gifts to the
    world, for he did not sufficiently love mankind either to devote his genius to
    benefit them, or to gain their applause for himself; but now at this time it
    seemed to him that he would readily employ all his rare talent to conquer one
    gentle heart.</p>
<p>He had the consciousness of his own genius, as all must have who possess it,—and
    at times the wild hope came across him that the young soul of Millicent, which
    ever seemed to him limpid and clear as a stream at its source, would so meet his
    own with its<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7183-197"/> treasures of poetry, that she
    would overlook his unsightly appearance. Millicent would have been overwhelmed
    with astonishment had she discovered the nature of his feelings. In France she
    had been taught to look on first‐cousins as brothers, and she had no intention
    of doing otherwise in England. Even had this idea been removed, however, poor
    Arthur, with his repulsive looks and his morbid gloomy disposition, would never
    have inspired her with any other feeling than that of compassion.</p>
<p>Arthur now recalled her to a recollection of his presence, by telling her that he
    was convinced her horse had cast a shoe, and that she had better stop and have
    it ascertained. This was done, and his supposition was found to be correct. She
    was obliged to dismount while the groom galloped off to a blacksmith’s which was
    fortunately near, and the rest of the party assembled round her. Aylmer
    suggested that they should all take<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7183-198"/> a walk
    until the horse was ready, but Anne and Fanny exclaimed against this idea,
    bidding him look in what part of the country they were before he proposed
    it.</p>
<p>In truth, Millicent and Aylmer had been talking too earnestly to observe the
    scene through which they were passing,—they were now in the very midst of the
    colliery district, surrounded on all sides by the miserable hovels in which the
    miners dwelt. It was certainly a most uninviting spot,—those cheerless,
    half‐ruined huts, rising but a little way above the black naked ground, had
    every appearance of the most squalid wretchedness; whilst the few ragged women
    and starved‐looking children who were crawling about, wore the stamp of abject
    poverty in every feature.</p>
<p>Aylmer was not surprised that the Miss Egertons did not choose to walk: he wished
    as they did that they had stopped anywhere else. He had a horror of suffering
    either in him‐<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7183-199"/> self or in others,—he liked
    sunny landscapes and smiling faces, and he shrank from the very thought of
    sorrow for himself, although as yet he had known little of it. He was by no
    means an unfeeling man: on the contrary, there was much depth and warmth in his
    character, but he felt, as many persons do with regard to the awful mass of
    poverty which overwhelms this vast country, that it was an evil quite beyond his
    reach, and therefore, since he could not remedy it, he would avoid all occasions
    of making himself unhappy by contemplating it. So thought and so acted the man
    under the influence of the world’s schooling,—not so felt Millicent Grey, who
    was as yet guided solely by natural impulse. She gazed round on the gloomy
    scene, with great astonishment for, as we have said, she had never looked
    poverty in the face. “What a dismal place this is!” she said; “surely it cannot
    be, that human beings live in those wretched abodes?”</p>
<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7183-200"/>
<p>“I fear they do,” said Aylmer. “It is sad to think what misery is around us, but
    we cannot help it.”</p>
<p>“We cannot help it!” She hardly understood what he meant: some impulse seemed to
    move her, and she walked towards the nearest hut,—Aylmer followed her. As they
    approached, they could distinguish a low moaning sound proceeding from
    within.</p>
<p>“Some one is in distress here,” exclaimed Millicent, and hastily pushing aside
    the door which was swinging half off its hinges, she entered the cottage. She
    found herself in a dark miserable room devoid of all furniture, and containing
    only some heaps of straw, serving apparently as beds to the wretched inmates.
    Close to the hearth, where not a spark of fire lingered among the black cinders,
    a woman sat crouching, her face buried in her hands, and her continual moaning
    seeming to indicate that she was in pain. Two half‐naked children lay sleeping
    at her feet.<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7183-201"/> Millicent shivered as she cast a
    rapid glance on the cheerless aspect of the place,—then going up to the woman,
    she laid her hand softly on her shoulder, and asked if anything was the matter
    with her. The poor creature looked up and gazed for a moment in her face, with a
    sort of vacant astonishment, but soon resuming her former position, she began to
    rock herself to and fro with many heavy sighs.</p>
<p>“Are you ill?” said Millicent, in a gentle voice.</p>
<p>“Ill enough,” replied the woman, with the sort of dogged sullenness which almost
    invariably takes possession of the pauper, who has long ceased to hope or expect
    relief.</p>
<p>“But then you surely have a doctor to attend you?—can he do you no good?” said
    Millicent, who never supposed it possible that any one could have to suffer,
    either morally or physically, without the means of relief.</p>
<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7183-202"/>
<p>Again the woman lifted her head, and looked at her; she evidently thought that
    the “lady” mocked her. Millicent repeated her question; a bitter smile passed
    over the woman’s face,—“Oh, ay,—we’ve a doctor, sure enough,—he puts us out of
    pain, any how: there’s my child, in the corner, see what he has done for her.”
    She pointed to what Millicent had fancied was only a bundle of rags: she now saw
    it was a tattered counterpane, covering a little child. She went and lifted it
    up, but started back appalled and almost frightened; the white rigid face which
    met her gaze, wore that expression of sternness and of indomitable calm, which
    is so strangely sublime when stamped on an infant brow. The majesty of death
    shone forth on the innocent countenance of the pauper’s little child, and filled
    her soul with awe. She let the covering fall over it with silent respect, and
    crept back to the poor mother.</p>
<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7183-203"/>
<p>“This is very sad; I feel so much for you; poor little child! How did you lose
    it?”</p>
<p>“Do you mean, what was it killed my baby?” said the woman, not yet softened by
    Millicent’s gentle sympathy. “You may know that soon enough: it was
    starvation.”</p>
<p>Millicent actually screamed, “Starvation! Oh, you do not mean it. Oh how
    dreadful! Surely it is not possible, and to think of that loaded table
    yesterday! Oh, we did not know it,—we did not know it, indeed!” she exclaimed,
    ready almost to fall on her knees, to ask forgiveness of this woman, for the
    luxury in which she lived.</p>
<p>“Ay, like enough,” said the woman, bitterly; “what should such as you know of us
    poor creatures!” And then passed through the mind of the starving pauper, a
    vision of that awful history, on which the<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7183-204"/>
    very souls of the poor do feed, finding therein a terrible consolation and a
    savage hope. It was the parable of Lazarus and the beggar.</p>
<p>“Oh, but if we had known it, we never would have let this happen,” said
    Millicent, trembling with agitation; “and at least you shall suffer no more
    now,—take this, take all this,” and she emptied her purse into the woman’s lap;
    “and I will bring you more, much more, to‐morrow,—everything you want.</p>
<p>For the first time the woman seemed to feel that her visitor’s compassion was
    genuine. She bowed her head, and burst into a passion of tears.</p>
<p>“Oh, my little baby, my poor, weeny baby! If I had had this, she need not have
    died; it is too late for her—too late!”</p>
<p>“But not for the others,” said Millicent, eagerly. “Oh, take comfort; I will
        never<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7183-205"/> let you want again. Indeed, indeed,
    we could not have lived in all our comforts had we known your suffering. But how
    was it? Surely some terrible misfortune caused it. What can have made you so
    very poor?”</p>
<p>“It is nothing strange, anyhow,” said the woman; “many and many’s the one I have
    seen worse off nor I have been. My husband’s a miner; from year’s end to year’s
    end he never comes out of them black mines; it’s work, work, in the dark, all
    day, and little pay; but it’s all one to me what he gets, I never sees a penny
    of it. He’s taken to drinking, that he may drive out care, and the parish won’t
    allow us nothing so long as he is in work—so here we may sit and starve.”</p>
<p>“It is a most extraordinary case,” said Millicent, “I never heard anything so
    sad. How strange that your condition was not known.”</p>
<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7183-206"/>
<p>The woman looked surprised; she well knew there was nothing uncommon in her
    case.</p>
<p>“Well, my lady, indeed it’s not me only; there’s scarce a family in the place
    that’s not as bad off nearly. I will speak up for them, poor creatures, for they
    have done what they could for me: many a time they’ve given me a bit of bread
    when not another soul’s come a‐nigh me.”</p>
<p>“Every family in the place as wretched!”</p>
<p>Millicent felt her brain almost reeling; she could not conceive the possibility
    of so many human beings in want of the necessaries of life within a few miles of
    those who were plunged in its luxuries; it was the horror of the contrast that
    overcame her. For the first time the great problem of want and superfluity was
    before her; to think of Rookcliffe and Milton Lodge, and half‐a‐dozen similar
    houses not five miles distant, with their abundance, their<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7183-207"/> comforts, their elegancies—and then these damp, naked
    walls, that child dead of hunger, that mother, sullen, hardened, mistrustful,
    losing the very woman’s heart within her, because of her unpitied anguish,
    Millicent stood with flushed cheek and trembling hands thinking on these things:
    the voice of Aylmer roused her—he had remained at the door watching her, and it
    interested him to see how those social evils, which have grown old and hackneyed
    amongst us, struck that fresh, penetrating mind, so clear‐sighted and so full of
    depth, even whilst ignorant of the commonest truths of daily life. He now told
    her, for the second time, that her horse was ready, and her cousins impatient to
    return home. She started, and, telling the woman she would send to her next day,
    abruptly left the hut. Here she paused, and, looking with a dismayed and anxious
    glance to the oilier cottages, she exclaimed:—</p>
<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7183-208"/>
<p>“We cannot go home yet; I must go into those houses, and tell them we will help
    them. She told me they were all equally wretched—starving!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense, Millicent!” exclaimed Anne, “you can’t be going into those hovels just
    now. If the people are in want, papa will send to relieve them—but I’ve no doubt
    they are imposing on you.”</p>
<p>“At all events, you really must not go,” said Charles; “you are by no means the
    proper person for such a task. You don’t understand these things, my dear little
    cousin, or they would not astonish you so much; there must be beggars
    everywhere, and we cannot help them all.”</p>
<p>Aylmer was pained by her look of distress as her cousins spoke, and he said to
    her, in a low voice:</p>
<p>“It is really better you should not go now, but I will come here to‐morrow and do
    all and everything you could wish.”</p>
<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7183-209"/>
<p>Millicent thanked him warmly, and at once mounted without another word. She rode
    on in front with Aylmer, for Arthur seemed anxious this time not to join them,
    and for a few minutes both were silent; at length, she turned to him with a look
    of deep agitation.</p>
<p>“Tell me,” she said, “in one word, is it a common spectacle which I have this day
    seen?—is it one isolated case; or has England many such?”</p>
<p>“Many thousands,” replied Aylmer. “It is best, in my opinion, not to know the
    fearful extent of the misery we cannot relieve; but if you insist on the plain
    truth, I must tell it. What you have seen is indeed a sight too sadly universal,
    and, in fact, what we witnessed to‐day is nothing compared with the awful amount
    of want and wretchedness which prevail in London and the great manufacturing
    towns.”</p>
<p>She could not speak to answer him:<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7183-210"/> we are too
    familiar with the great truth his words had conveyed, to conceive how appalling
    such a statement was, to one who had never dreamt of such things before.</p>
<p>Heavily did the first knowledge of the great dark tragedy for ever enacted by the
    poor, come over that young spirit. The sense of her own utter helplessness
    became insupportable: she bowed her face on her hands and wept aloud. Aylmer
    felt a pang of remorse at sight of those pure teams falling for the sorrows of
    others. How far gone was the time when he could so have mourned with unselfish
    pity? Truly, had there ever been such a time for him? So early had the natural
    sympathies, the first quick impulses been deadened by habit and education,
    chilled by custom and experience; he felt that he was looking on the fresh dews
    that well forth only, in the spring and morning of<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7183-211"/> the heart, and the sight inspired him with an
    involuntary reverence.</p>
<p>Millicent was ashamed of her emotion, and she soon conquered it.</p>
<p>“It is the terrible, the unnatural contrast between our own condition, and that
    of these hapless beings, which overpowers me so much; if all suffered alike,—if
    such were the destiny of man, then all might submit and endure with faith and
    patience; but that some should have, not abundance only, but a hundred fold more
    than they can use, not personal luxuries alone, but the most costly ornaments to
    the rich homes in which they dwell, to the very floors on which they tread,—and
    others, meanwhile, perish, actually perish in cold and hunger; it is this that
    seems to me so appalling,—how can we dare to live as we do?”</p>
<p>“But, my dear Miss Grey,” said Aylmer, soothingly, for he saw she was strongly
    excited, “you must reflect that you are now<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7183-212"/>
    for the first time looking on that great national and social evil, which
    occupies the whole thoughts and attention of legislators and political
    economists. You have been laying bare the most deep wound which the best and
    wisest of men so long have sought in vain to heal. All see the evil, all deplore
    it,—but who shall suggest a remedy? It seems to be an imperative law of nature
    that these widely‐contrasted positions should exist?”</p>
<p>“Doubtless,” exclaimed Millicent, “I know that equality is as impossible as it is
    undesirable. I have discovered that, in reading history. I remember to have
    noted in the records of nations how, when rank was abolished, the aristocracy of
    talent or of power straightway took its place. No! ignorant as I feel myself, I
    have read enough to have imbibed the most deep‐rooted horror for all leveling
    and republican principles. The distinction of rank and station<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7183-213"/> is clearly a divine as well as a necessary principle,
    and even for the sake of the lower classes one would not have it otherwise. We
    should do a great evil, I am sure, if we sought to change the condition of the
    merry French peasant, or the contented English labourer. I went with Sophia to
    one of their cottages yesterday, and I was so charmed with the scene,—but I did
    not think there were any much poorer than these. I never dreamt of people
    actually starving; and it is the violent extreme of the contrast between rich
    and poor which strikes me so painfully; the palace‐houses, and the wealth
    expended, on a thousand costly frivolities which have not even an intrinsic
    value, (being altogether useless; the devices of fashion for the employment of
    superfluous riches,) and then the utter destitution with its daily, hourly
    agony. Many grades in our social system there must and ought to be, but surely
    it is a fearful thing<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7183-214"/> that there should be
    within a few yards of each other men revelling even to satiety in the full
    sunshine blaze of prosperity, and others lost in the darkest depths of misery,
    barren even of hope?”</p>
<p>“No doubt it is a fearful thing, and you cannot suppose you are the first to have
    discovered it. Believe me, the noblest intellects in our own land have been
    devoted to the task of seeking a remedy for it,—but they have found none as yet
    any more than you could; it is an evil, passing man’s power to compass.”</p>
<p>“But that is surely no reason why we should be indifferent to it,” said Millicent
    very gently; “I think it is taking a dreary and enervating view of the case to
    say that because we cannot remedy it, we will not think of it at all. I see your
    remark conveyed to me a strong reproof for my presumption in attempting to
    discuss such a deep subject, and certainly it was deserved,<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7183-215"/> and would be more so, if I really pretended to give
    an opinion on matters with which women have nothing to do, and which ought to
    occupy the wise heads of statesmen only,—and indeed I do not even know what is
    meant by political economy. But, Mr. Aylmer, my eyes have looked on the face of
    a fellow creature who died of starvation, and I think had even the veriest child
    stood and gazed on such a sight, it would have asked if there was no remedy, and
    would have thought upon the matter.”</p>
<p>“Unquestionably,” said Aylmer, “they are thoughts which force themselves on every
    mind, and I can perfectly understand, after the hermit‐life you have led, that
    these great evils strike you in a new and appalling light, which we who are too
    much accustomed to them, could not conceive. But still I can but repeat what I
    said before,—the deadly wound is there, but who shall find the soothing balm
    wherewith to heal it?”</p>
<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7183-216"/>
<p>“I am very fond of Utopia,” said Millicent, suddenly turning her bright face to
    him, “I like wandering there in visions which, though I well how they can never
    he realized, still do one’s heart good to fancy they warm one into hope. Now my
    Utopia for the poor, would be, that each man to whom is given as his station,
    the advantages of material and intellectual wealth, should instead of living for
    himself, live for those, his sorrowing brethren, and devote his life’s energy to
    ameliorate their condition,—if all did this, might not their universal efforts
    compass, so far as the world’s predestined fate permits, a universal evil?”</p>
<p>“Utopia, indeed,” said Aylmer smiling, but he had not time to add more, for
    Charles rode up at that moment.</p>
<p>“Millicent,” he said, “I can stand this no longer; ever since we had the
    misfortune to let you go into that cottage you have had<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7183-217"/> an expression on your face, which has chilled me, as
    if we were in the month of December. Pray restore us to that very Italian summer
    which you brought with you into the dull old house at Rookcliffe. You introduced
    yourself among us as a most merry and amusing companion, and really you will
    have gained all our hearts on false pretences if you assume any other character
    now.”</p>
<p>Millicent saw that Charles was talking much more earnestly than was his wont, and
    as her spirits were far too light and elastic to remain long depressed, she
    readily accepted his challenge, and made the old woods ring with her clear merry
    laugh, as they rode homewards.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p><hi>IT</hi> was quite impossible for Millicent Grey to remain long in a
    desponding humour, yet she could not forget the scene she had witnessed, and
    when the family assembled before dinner, she began describing it to her uncle as
    he stood with his capacious person benevolently protecting the fire from any
    intrusive approaches.</p>
<p>“Well, my dear,” he answered, “this is no doubt very sad, but you would find the
    same poverty in many parts of the kingdom;<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7183-219"/>
    these things really cannot be helped. I was quite aware that there was much
    wretchedness in the mining district, where you unfortunately went to‐day; but it
    is far beyond the power of any single individual or party of individuals to
    relieve it; you may rest assured, Millicent, that I would willingly do what I
    could for them.”</p>
<p>Millicent had a spice of mischief in her disposition, and since her residence in
    England, she had often found no small amusement in reducing the respectable
    theories which pervade our atmosphere, to the test of practice.</p>
<p>“I am sure you would, dear uncle, you would do all you could for these starving
    people, even though it involved a little self‐sacrifice, would you not?”</p>
<p>“I trust, Millicent, when you have lived sometime longer in this house, you will
    not require to ask such a question: you will then learn that those who feel the
    most, say the<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7183-220"/> least.”—“And do the least,
    also,” muttered Charles, <foreign xml:lang="ita">sotto voce</foreign>.</p>
<p>“I beg that you will not suppose that you are the only person who deplores the
    condition of these paupers,” continued Egerton, with no small testiness; “the
    Egertons, from time immemorial, have laboured for the good of their tenantry.”
    (“And the improvement of their lands,” continued Charles, with his running
    accompaniment,) “And that in a manner which would prove to you that they do not
    shrink from self‐sacrifice.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I am sure of it,” said Millicent, “and in this instance also, as well as in
    others.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, if there were anything to done, but we have often talked it over our
    parochial meetings, and it is a case beyond our efforts.”</p>
<p>“Well, you are so indulgent, you know, uncle, in letting me tell out all my
        wild<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7183-221"/> fancies, now do forgive my boldness,
    but even for this affair—I have an idea—”</p>
<p>She hesitated, and laughed at what she inwardly qualified as her own cool
    presumption.</p>
<p>“Let us have it, my dear,” said Mr. Egerton, condescendingly patting her
    shoulder. “Curious results have often arisen,” he continued, addressing his
    wife, “from the innocent remarks of children and young persons; their very
    ignorance causes them to take such novel views of the subject as often produce
    very valuable suggestions.”</p>
<p>“I wonder whose remarks are innocent now,” murmured Charles, as he looked at the
    contrast between his father’s bland and stolid countenance, where beamed not a
    ray of any fire more ethereal than that at which he was slowly roasting, and
    Millicent’s intelligent face, her clear eyes sparkling with all the rigour of a
    young, fresh intellect.</p>
<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7183-222"/>
<p>“Then I have leave to say anything I please, however presumptuous?” asked
    she.</p>
<p>Mr. Egerton waved his hand encouragingly.</p>
<p>“Pray tell me, then, supposing that two thousand pounds could be yearly
    distributed for the support of the miners’ families, or for increasing the pay
    of the men themselves, to such an amount as should prevent the possibility of
    want for their children, would it not go far to relieve the distress even of
    that whole district?”</p>
<p>“Of course it would, any child might know that; but where is such a sum to come
    from?”</p>
<p>Millicent cast a sly glance at the old gentleman’s pockets, which suddenly
    enlightened Charles as to the nature of her ideas on the subject; she took care,
    however, that her words should not seem quite so crude as were her thoughts.</p>
<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7183-223"/>
<p>“Why you know, uncle, you told me when you were describing many of the English
    customs to me, that an establishment like yours could not be kept up under three
    thousand a‐year, and that the rest of your income went to the improvement of
    your estate.”</p>
<p>“Very true.” Mr. Egerton began to look uneasy.</p>
<p>“Then, if all persons situated like yourself were to feel that they would like to
    make any sacrifice to save the starving people, you might all determine to give
    up, at least, a whole two thousand a‐year to them; and it could be easily done
    by changing the style of living entirely, and reducing the family expenses to
    somewhere about eight hundred a‐year. It would be quite riches, you know, in
    comparison to what half the population have.”</p>
<p>“Easily done!—riches!” Mr. Egerton was so astonished that he could only ejaculate
        a<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7183-224"/> few fragmentary, portions of his great
    indignation.</p>
<p>“Yes,” we should all have to give up our comforts, of course—carriages, horses,
    all that; but then what could be compared to the luxury of knowing that never
    again should any one die of starvation so near; and we might be immensely happy
    and comfortable on the income you still would have left. We should live in a
    very different way, and being so large a family, perhaps we should not have much
    more than the necessaries of life; but these necessaries would be shared by
    hundreds of families, who have them not at all just now.”</p>
<p>“Shared. indeed!” said Mr. Egerton<corr>.</corr></p>
<p>“It might not be possible to live at Rookcliffe on that pittance,” continued
    Millicent, warming with her subject, “but as it is not an old family place; and
    only lately bought by yourself, you could complete the good work<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7183-225"/> by selling it, and so gaining another enormous sum
    for the poor.”</p>
<p>“Now, thanks to my good fortune, the place is entailed,” muttered Charles.</p>
<p>“Millicent, you are talking the most consummate nonsense,” suddenly shouted her
    uncle, having recovered his voice and his breath, which had been fairly taken
    away by her unexpected proposal. “You don’t know what you are saying, and I wish
    to goodness you would keep quiet,—I never heard such arrant folly in my life.”
    Millicent was frightened into silence fast enough by this tremendous burst of
    indignation, and she retreated behind her cousins, who were all laughing
    heartily.</p>
<p>“I’ve one comfort,” said Mr. Egerton, beginning to cool down, and addressing his
    wife, who was the picture of rigid disapprobation, “that mad girl’s own fortune
    is safe in my hands till she is of age, and I<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7183-226"/>
    hope by that time we may find some sensible man to take care of it for her.”
    Mrs. Egerton shook her head ominously, and they all felt relieved when dinner
    was announced.</p>
<p>Mr. Aylmer dined with them next day, and Millicent found that he had amply
    fulfilled his promise with respect to the poor people she had seen. He had
    awakened Colonel Bentley’s compassion for them, who, like many other good
    people, was most liberal whenever his attention was drawn to the subject, but
    who never thought it could be at all necessary for him to rise out of his usual
    apathetic indifference unless an actual appeal were made to him. His nephew had,
    however, spent the day among the miners, and he brought Millicent such a report
    of the relief they were to receive, as filled her with gratitude towards
    him.</p>
<p>The party at Rookcliffe was further<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7183-227"/> enlivened
    on this day by the curate of the parish and his pretty wife. He was a very
    comfortable curate indeed. His good fortune had procured for him in his present
    subordinate position that prosperous ease, which is the usual perquisite of
    rectors only. Being very good looking and of pleasant manners, he had won for
    his companion not only a handsome and elegant woman, but an heiress to boot,
    through which means he was now enabled to live in a splendid house, whose
    luxurious apartments it must have been rather difficult to quit, on the cold
    nights when the sick people sent for him. He was a very cheerful young man; just
    the sort of person to swell the number of those clerical Bluebeards, who are
    perpetually rising, as phœnix bridegrooms, from the ashes of the widower state,
    and of whom England possesses so many, happy in the affections of their third or
    fourth wife. He had two great leading<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7183-228"/>
    principles, which chiefly governed his existence; the first was a strong
    abhorrence and avoidance of non‐essentials, of which he had a very large list,
    and an equally great dislike to what he termed “morbidness,” under which head he
    qualified all acute feeling, sensitiveness, and fervour, whether in matters
    theological or domestic. There were also two or three young ladies of that
    species, who love to look at other young ladies through their eye‐glasses, and
    whose object is to exalt themselves, by an exclusiveness, which shuts out from
    the charity of their sympathy, all but the very few who have attained the
    fashionable nonchalance that professes to require none of it.</p>
<p>Millicent found herself seated between Charles Egerton and the curate, with
    Aylmer sufficiently near to join in the conversation. Charles had been talking
    with him, of his extreme impatience for the arrival of the hunting season, which
    was in his estimation<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7183-229"/> the only period of the
    year worth living for.</p>
<p>“That is a noble sight you have yet to see, Miss Grey,” said the curate; “of
    course you have never witnessed an English fox‐hunt,—I quite envy you the first
    impression, you will be so delighted.”</p>
<p>“Don’t calculate on Miss Grey being delighted with anything that delights other
    people, my dear Reverendissimo,” said Charles. “With all due respect, Millicent,
    I may be allowed to mention, that your tastes and ideas are slightly peculiar. I
    have no doubt, if you would favour us now with your views on fox‐hunting, you
    would prove to us that we had been labouring under some great mistake respecting
    it.”</p>
<p>“You really make me feel,” said Millicent, laughing, “as if I had some mental
        <emph>peculiarity</emph>, which deserves a less gentle name; but what can I
    do? I come to England, and I look straight at everything,<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7183-230"/> and I see what it is, and then, if you ask me, I must
    tell you. One can’t help distinguishing between black and white; if it is black
    I must say so.”</p>
<p>“Exactly; but that is just the thing. All our innocent customs seem to you so
    very black,” replied Charles. “Pray tell us now, however, what you think of
    hunting. Where is our error? Perhaps it is not a fox we run after at all.”</p>
<p>“Very true,” said Millicent, composedly, “it is not the fox, it is his tail, and
    that is just what surprises me,—to think of ever so many intellectual men; all
    very learned, having had classical educations and the highest grade of
    instruction, giving themselves so much trouble and expense, and putting
    themselves into a violent heat, all for the sake of getting the simple tail of a
    fox.”</p>
<p>“But we don’t call it a tail,” exclaimed Charles, “it is the brush.”</p>
<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7183-231"/>
<p>“You can call it what you like, but it is the tail all the same, you know,
    neither the fox himself nor anybody else can doubt that; and I must say, few
    things astonish me more than the extraordinary love you all seem to have for it.
    You keep up horses and hounds at an enormous expense; you have a whole
    establishment for the purpose, and actually a sort of uniform, as if you were
    going to conquer an army instead of gaining only a wretched little tail. You
    long for the hunting season all the year round, and then, when the happy time
    does come, you all assemble together, ever so many full‐grown men, in the pride
    of your intellect and strength, and you ride off at the risk of your lives, all
    struggling who is to gain the precious piece of goods, and every one hating the
    man who gets it, when he rides back in triumph with his tail.”</p>
<p>“Millicent, you are really too absurd,” said Charles. “it is not the brush, or
        the<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7183-232"/> tail as you will persist in calling
    it, that is our object in hunting,—we only take it as a proof that we came in at
    the death. It is the excitement and amusement of the chase that we like.”</p>
<p>“The amusement of seeing a fox die,—of watching it straining and panting, with
    its poor heart bursting, as they say it does sometimes, in the effort,—flying in
    the torture of pursuit, with the open‐mouthed dogs at its heels, making the most
    incredible exertions to escape, and then sinking exhausted and quivering, to
    feel the teeth of the hound in its throat. No, I would rather think it was the
    love of the tail, than believe that men of feeling and mind should make their
    pleasure in the death‐agonies of poor helpless animal?</p>
<p>“But, Millicent, you do use such extraordinary terms. It is not the actual
    pleasure of seeing the fox die, though they do a great deal of mischief, and
    must be destroyed, but<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7183-233"/> it is the fine bracing
    exercise, and the opportunity of trying one’s courage, that is really of use to
    the health and the mind as well.”</p>
<p>“If the foxes must be destroyed, let the farmers destroy them, or the butchers
    who perform the same office for the oxen and sheep. You never think of kindly
    relieving <emph>them</emph> of their task, although I don’t in the least see why
    you should not just as well assemble to kill the mutton and beef. As to
    exercise, you can gallop on horseback quite as fast without having a fox in an
    agony running before you; and for the display, or the testing of valour,
    considering that this world, is very full of such things, as the oppression of
    the helpless, and the wronging of the innocent, I think some nobler means might
    be found for the trial of your courage.”</p>
<p>“Miss Grey, it seems extraordinary to hear you talking, against what has always
    been considered quite an honour to England<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7183-234"/> and
    peculiar to the country, such a fine manly sport,” said the curate.</p>
<p>“I cannot think it manly to take a pleasure in the torture of a poor dumb victim,
    and that any one should find sport in it is beyond my conception. No, Charles, I
    am certain if you analyze the especial charm of fox‐hunting, you will find it is
    the intrinsic value of the tail, unless, as I said before, you choose to admit
    that it is the delight of seeing the unhappy brute killed before your eyes,—in
    which case if humanity has fallen thus far, the sooner they give up fostering so
    cruel a taste the better, to my mind.”</p>
<p>“Only you must remember, Miss Grey,” said Aylmer, “that the same argument applies
    to all field‐sports; shooting, and fishing, and everything of the kind.”</p>
<p>“Well, I can only say of these as of fox hunting, I do think it degrading to man
    that he should find his pleasure and amusement, in the pain of any created
        thing.<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7183-235"/> Since they must be put to death
    that they may serve as food, let it be done by hired people, as of necessity;
    but do not let their expiring struggles form the systematic delight of a set of
    amateur butchers. If only each one of them would make their chosen pursuit in
    the relief of pain, and the giving of happiness to others, instead of this
    contrary principle, what a strange bright world this soon might be made.”</p>
<p>“Well, Miss Millicent, I declare I have you there!” exclaimed Charles. “You do
    give a great pleasure to others in hunting; for the hounds like it extremely:
    they take a real pleasure in it.”</p>
<p>“Then, do you mean me to suppose that Englishmen are so very tender‐hearted, and
    so considerate of the feelings of the lower animals, that they actually take all
    this trouble, and devote themselves, at the risk of their lives, for the sole
    purpose of pleasing their dogs? How extraordinarily kind!<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7183-236"/> but if their motives are so very disinterested, it
    strikes me that there is a slight error in their judgment, for of course you
    would not wish to give a preference, in your sympathy to any one species of the
    brute creation in particular: so that whilst you are carefully providing for
    canine gratification, you overlook altogether, the necessity of consulting the
    feelings of the fox himself.”</p>
<p>“There is no use in arguing with you, most pertinacious cousin,” said Charles,
    “but really it is incredible that you should composedly give forth a sweeping
    condemnation of all field sports, the old well‐established amusements of
    England.”</p>
<p>“You must lay all the blame on my defective education,” said Millicent, laughing.
    “I am quite aware that I have never learned my catechism.”</p>
<p>“Come, that is in my province, Miss Grey,” said the curate; “I will undertake you
    as a pupil.”</p>
<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7183-237"/>
<p>“Oh, no, I do not mean what you would be bound to teach me,” said Millicent. “I
    mean that theoretic catechism, unacknowledged but universally learned, which
    teaches the popular and received meaning of those things that are not destined
    to be called by their right names. It seems to me that, in this country, every
    one is duly instructed in a set of useful principles—little systems for the rule
    of social life, which are all ticketed and labeled with the finest possible
    sounding names, and these, when once impressed upon the young mind, can never
    again be separated from the fallacy they protect. I dare say the children have
    picture‐books full of practical illustrations, and their nurses show them two
    men shooting at each other, and say, ‘Now, my dear, this is honour;’ (for you
    call a duel the vindication of your honour, don’t you?) and a gentleman watching
    the worrying of a fox, Charles, and say, ‘This is a<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7183-238"/> healthy amusement for mind and body,’ with a variety
    of other scenes, representing prudence, and proper pride, and self‐respect, and
    charity which begins and finishes at home. Now, you see, never having learned
    these technical terms, all things present themselves to me in their natural true
    form, without any disguise whatever, and of course I talk of them as I see them;
    but now, I have been quite impertinent enough for one day, so I shall not speak
    another word; but I mean to listen to that grave discussion, which my uncle is
    holding with the old lady, in the purple face and turban.”</p>
<p>Aylmer brought Millicent a most pressing request from Mrs. Hartley and her
    brother, that she would spend the following day with them, to which she
    willingly agreed; and from that time forward, it became a sort of tacit
    arrangement that she should be with them every day when it was possible for her
    to walk to Milton Lodge.</p>

<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p><hi>THREE</hi> months had passed away: autumn had come with its sighing winds, so
    like the voice of the decaying year lamenting its departed brightness; and,
    outwardly, there seemed little more of change, in the inhabitants of Rookcliffe,
    than in the old walls themselves. And, yet, if we had power to see it, strange
    wild dramas are enacted day by day in the silent souls of those around us; they
    walk beside us unchanged in aspect, and we dream not of the dark shadows that<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7183-240"/> may be stealing over the heart we still
    believe so light and joyous; we fancy that to be reserve which is the instinct
    of deep feeling; and that bitter pride, which folds over deep gnawing wounds the
    quiet hands that tremble not, to be the calm of a contented mind, and yet there
    may be working in that tranquil breast, the seeds of mortal anguish which have
    driven many to insanity or death. Outwardly, no change at Rookcliffe, but for
    two of those who dwelt beneath its roof, it was as though the earth on which
    their youthful steps had trodden, with all its lights and shadows, its joys and
    sorrows, had passed away for ever, and there was a new world with a new state of
    existence. Yet, not in the same region were these spirits wandering now. When
    the winds of destiny are unbound from their hid cavern, and set forth on their
    appointed mission, the same blast which sweeps away the hopes from the soul of
    one, like withered<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7183-241"/> leaves from a tree, bears
    the seeds of sweet flowers to the heart of another, where they germinate and
    flourish to fill the whole being with fragrance. It was so with Millicent and
    Arthur. The one was in a land of light and gladness now, where the sun of hope
    had risen, and shone unsetting, so that there was no night there; and the whole
    air was filled with melody, whose music was from one voice alone, and all things
    were made lovely, with the presence of that perfect beauty, which is ever in the
    face of one beloved.</p>
<p>And the other was far away, in a chill and frozen region, where the sun of hope
    had sunk, as beneath the deep waters of despair, so that there was no day there,
    and no melody, because the voice that made sweet music gave all its gentle tones
    unto another, and no beauty, because the face beloved, was radiant only with the
    joy, that came from other love than his.</p>
<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7183-242"/>
<p>It may be, that if some observed, how the tread of Arthur Egerton, was slower and
    heavier than of old, and his eyes dim, as though, not sleep alone, but dreams,
    had fled from him, they thought the chill weather, and the gloom of decaying
    nature subdued the poet’s fiery soul; but they never dreamt that these were
    tokens of the cold dead winter of the heart, where all the sweet blossoms of his
    spring of hope, lay mouldering away, blasted by the freezing winds of
    disappointment; and little did they think, when calmly he moved amongst them,
    that he had passed through that convulsion of the mind, which is like to the
    shock of death itself, for it is the rending away of the very life hope, from
    the being that seems to fall a dull inert mass of clay without it.</p>
<p>But if they noted the change that had passed on Millicent Grey, they could, in
    some sense, understand it; for they knew<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7183-243"/> that
    she was the promised wife of Stephen Aylmer. Great was the change, in truth,
    that had come upon her,—none greater in the phases of a purely earthly
    existence,—it was as though a new being had been given to her, for it was life,
    animated by a new principle.</p>
<p>She had done that thing, the most perilous, the most awful which any can do in
    this mere mortal life. She had delivered up her whole heart and soul to the love
    of one human idol. We have seen how her young, ardent spirit had flown forth
    into life, to seek that object for its worship, which, exiled from its own true
    home by ignorance and misconception, it sought in earth alone; and how she was
    led to the belief, that the intense indefinite longing, the aching void of her
    soul could, only find a rest in one deep human affection,—in the entire devotion
    of her life to the happiness of another. Before ever she had learnt to<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7183-244"/> feel, she already held in theory, what was
    the natural impulse of her woman’s heart.</p>
<p>And now, with her, that surrender of every faculty of the being, to one absorbing
    thought, was entire; for she had no ties of blood, no childhood’s affection to
    draw her heart’s deep tenderness in other channels, nor had she ever yet
    effected an entrance into that bright and holy life, within whose pure
    atmosphere no god of dust and clay can find a throne.</p>
<p>Once in a life‐time, only, is such an affection felt, as that which bound
    Millicent Grey to Stephen Aylmer. All was bright and prosperous around her now;
    a few short months, as she believed, would see her linked to him by holiest
    ties; yet not because of present hope and joy, was this deep, earnest friendship
    so intense. If in the future, storms and clouds should come upon the sunshine of
    her happiness,—if even he who was her idol, should by<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7183-245"/> unworthy deeds, or chilled affection, fall from the
    high pedestal where she had placed him in her great esteem, it could not change
    or lessen her attachment for him. It seemed to have taken root in the very
    principle of life itself, and with the life alone could now expire.</p>
<p>And she was changed. The fierce independence of mind, the quick energetic
    scrutiny of life, were over. Much more thoughtful, more still and silent; every
    look and tone told how her spirit was subdued to his. She thought as he thought,
    loved what he loved, and could have even learned to hate what he hated. Her eyes
    no longer wandered restlessly, seeking a hope in life, but ever rested on him,
    in whom all joys were bound up; her feet no longer strayed, searching a path
    that should give the promise of an aim on earth, but meekly journeyed where he
    trod, content to make it her life’s mission, to<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7183-246"/> clear away the stones and thorns before steps.</p>
<p>And Stephen Aylmer?—was she all in all to him, as he to her? No one ever made a
    plot so palpably manifest, or flattered himself that he concealed it so ably, as
    did Colonel Bentley, when, having set his heart on effecting a marriage between
    Aylmer and his favourite Millicent, he commenced, by a series of the most
    glaring manœuvres, the task of accomplishing his purpose. Colonel Bentley was a
    singular old man; if once an idea took possession of him, however unexpectedly
    or wildly, it was utterly impossible for himself or others to eradicate it.
    Already when he quitted Millicent, at the Tower Stairs, on their arrival, had he
    made up his mind that she was the very person he desired to be the wife of his
    favourite nephew, as well as a satisfactory niece to himself, and he never from
    that moment lost sight of his object. For this reason he came to Milton<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7183-247"/> Lodge—for this reason he monopolized
    Millicent’s society, and while his wish and his purpose strengthened every day,
    he failed not to give Stephen the strongest possible intimations that if his
    will were thwarted on this point, he might go so far as to transfer his property
    from so refractory an individual to the young girl herself.</p>
<p>But Aylmer had no desire to disappoint his uncle’s wishes, if by any means he
    could accommodate himself to them, and this, after a short acquaintance with
    Millicent, he found himself willing to do. He had not the slightest attachment
    for her—he never yet had felt a strong affection for any one, and she had failed
    to effect any change in this respect. He had, in fact, come to the conclusion
    that he never was to find his ideal, or feel deeply for any living being. But it
    was impossible to know Millicent Grey, so frank, so generous, so warm‐hearted,
    without loving her in some degree; and he did like her, quite well enough<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7183-248"/> to make her his life’s companion, with a
    hearty good will. He did not attempt to conceal from himself, that she was not
    in the least, what he had always resolved, his wife should be. His ideal had
    ever been one of surpassing beauty; for, as we have said elsewhere, he
    worshipped the Beautiful with all the fervency and devotion which men offer to
    the self‐elected gods to whom they cause their souls to bow, in order to satisfy
    the craving of their nature for adoration; and the sweet face of Millicent Grey
    had none of that perfection or symmetry which would win the artist’s heart,
    although it was very pleasing from its charming expression, especially of late,
    when softened by the reflection of the deep, generous tenderness that filled her
    heart.</p>
<p>In short, it had not been given to her to call to life the strong affections that
    lay hid in the heart of that proud man; waiting only, till the crisis of his
    destiny, to rise up<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7183-249"/> like billows from the
    ocean of deceitful calm, and swell out in their ungovernable might, till they
    well nigh made shipwreck of his soul, Aylmer was little aware of the intense
    power of attachment, which lurked in his own nature, or, if he were, he never
    expected to meet any one who would call it forth; and meanwhile he was well
    content to secure to himself, so faithful and devoted a companion, as he saw
    that Millicent would be to him. It was a pleasant thing to think that this pure,
    boundless love would breathe such warmth into his whole life—that he would be
    ministered unto day by day with such earnest watchful care.</p>
<p>He could not but love her too, in some degree, now that the near approach of the
    time fixed for their marriage had put an end to reserve between them, and that
    he saw how generously and devotedly her whole heart was given to him. His warm
    sympathy for the poor, and active exertions on<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7183-250"/>
    their behalf, had been the first things which had caused her to distinguish him,
    from all around her, and her vivid imagination had soon invested him with an
    ideal character of almost perfect moral beauty, to which his many really good
    qualities gave a strong semblance of reality; and now, she had not an idea how
    poor was the return he made her for the vast wealth, of the whole deathless
    affection she had bestowed upon him; or if at times she was constrained to feel
    how she was but a very small part in his existence—whilst his own image had shut
    out the world for her, she conceived it but the natural result of the great
    superiority, which she was convinced he possessed over herself.</p>
<p>She felt that he had given her the highest proof of esteem, in choosing her from
    all the world, to be his first and best friend until death, and she asked no
    more, since this gave her a right to minister even to his faintest wish.</p>
<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7183-251"/>
<p>Moreover, her attachment had that entire disinterestedness, which is inherent to
    the very nature of all deep and intense affection. She no longer thought of
    herself at all, save as the privileged guardian of his existence on earth; nor
    had she now any wish, or hope, or object, except his happiness. This was the
    star of her life, which was to guide her every thought, and word, and deed,—it
    was the desire of her heart, the one absorbing thought of her soul; his
    happiness, not her own; nor yet his only, as united to hers, but his, by any
    means in which it could be procured for him, either by the offering of her whole
    life’s devotion with him, or the sacrifice of her whole life’s joy without
    him.</p>
<p>They stood together now, side by side, on a rising ground, within the park, at
    Rookcliffe, where they had been walking. They were returning home, and paused
    here, to look at the fair, peaceful scene that<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7183-252"/>
    was spread out before them, in the faint light of the autumn evening. He looked
    with his free, proud glance, on the landscape,—but she, on him, with a timid,
    wistful gaze in her earnest eyes, as though the poor, trembling soul within her
    were whispering, “I have done a fearful thing, I have given you my whole
    existence, my whole capacity for happiness,—I have given you my life. Oh, what
    will you make of it? Will you deal tenderly with it, and be merciful to it,—will
    you fill it with light and joy, as you may do so easily, by a little loving
    kindness, or will you be rude and careless with it, and cast it from you, to
    perish in some desert waste?”</p>
<p>It might have been the melancholy season of the year, the sight of nature in her
    mourning garments, as though it were her time of widowhood for the summer,—the
    whisperings of decay and death that went forth in the rustle of the falling
    leaves, and<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7183-253"/> the rough wantoning of the wind
    with the naked branches,—but certain it is, the heart of Millicent was full of a
    strange terror, and a sad foreboding. She crept close to the side of Aylmer,—he
    looked round kindly at her.</p>
<p>“How silent you are, dear Millicent,—almost sad, I think.”</p>
<p>The sound of his voice made her smile.</p>
<p>“No, not sad, I could not be so now, I am too deeply, really happy. But to‐day, I
    do not know how it is,—I fear you will think me fanciful,—only I feel such a
    terror.”</p>
<p>“A terror of what?” he asked, anxiously.</p>
<p>“Of life, I think,” she answered; “it seems to me such a fearfully precarious
    thing,—its entire happiness or utter misery hangs on so slender a thread.
    Often,—the living or dying of one single hope, can make it a beautiful and
    blessed gift, or a crushing, intolerable burden. Its destinies are<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7183-254"/> so irretrievable, if once the soul has been wrecked
    on its treacherous waves, where it wanders, seeking joy, then the perishing of
    its peace is beyond all recall, and it is borne on by the tide through tempests
    and gloom, dead to all earthly bliss, as the corpse drifting down to its grave
    in the deep. I feel just now as if it required such courage to live, it is such
    a perilous venture: to‐day we are happy,—to‐morrow, but one step more in our
    mortal journey, may have plunged us into a hopelessness of sorrow, from which we
    never rise again. The life once doomed, can never return to the days of its hope
    and freedom. Though its ruin may have been worked in our youth, and that of our
    own very hands, yet the one chance is gone, and the game lost for us,—we cannot
    go back to mould it anew. Cheerless and dark as we made it, it drags with us on
    to old age and to death.”</p>
<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7183-255"/>
<p>“Dear Millicent, these are dark words, indeed! I hardly know you, speaking thus.
    All you say is perfectly true, no doubt, but it should only make us rejoice the
    more that <emph>our</emph> venture in the great game of life has been so
    fortunate. Our prospects are bright enough, are they not? You have nothing to
    fear for yourself: so far as one may judge the future, there is only calm
    enjoyment before you.”</p>
<p>“I do not think it can be for myself I fear, though, in truth, I hardly know what
    it is that terrifies me to‐night,—but cannot be any thought of myself; for,
    Stephen, you do not know, I never can tell you, how all my hopes, and wishes,
    and feelings, have become absorbed in one intense, unutterable longing for your
    happiness. It is my one dream, my one thought,—I can seek, I can strive for
    nothing else. I almost fear it must be wrong, to be so given up to this one<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7183-256"/> thought, I cannot even pray for anything
    besides.”</p>
<p>He was touched by these words, the tone of her voice told how they came from her
    very heart. He spoke to her with a grateful tenderness, and soon soothed the
    passing agitation into which she had allowed herself to be betrayed; then,
    anxious to divert her thoughts from the dark misgivings which seemed
    unaccountably to have taken possession of her, he continued, with greater
    cheerfulness,—</p>
<p>“Now I shall not let you think any more of these dismal forebodings. Tell me
    rather what is that black shadow passing along the avenue down there? It looks,
    at this distance, like a great spider creeping on towards the house.”</p>
<p>“It is the carriage, I have no doubt, coming home with my cousin Juliet. You know
    she is to arrive to‐day from Italy, and this is just the hour when she was
    expected.”</p>
<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7183-257"/>
<p>“True,—I remember! I am rather anxious to see this same cousin of yours; I heard
    of her often at Milan, but never chanced to meet her. You have never seen her
    yourself, have you?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no; she has been absent ever since I was at Rookcliffe—but they speak of her
    constantly. I have heard her described many times.”</p>
<p>“And always as a wonderfully beautiful person, have you not? At least, that was
    the reputation she had in Italy, and my artist friends were by no means easy to
    please on that subject.”</p>
<p>“I suppose there were never two opinions as to Juliet’s beauty; even Charles was
    enthusiastic about her. She must be a strange person, from his account; he
    described her to me, as having a very subtle, powerful mind, hid beneath a great
    outward appearance of frankness.”</p>
<p>“Well, excuse me if I seem rather un‐<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7183-258"/> gallant,
    but I confess I have no faith in any woman possessing, that sort of depth of
    character, which has the Machiavelian talent of concealing great power under
    apparent simplicity. They have intensity of feeling, but rarely are capable of
    profound calculations. One can read them right easily, and pleasant reading it
    is, too, Millicent dear, at least in some cases.”</p>
<p>“I hope you mean that as a compliment, for I shall certainly appropriate it,”
    said Millicent, laughing. “But I trust you are right about Juliet, for I feel
    rather afraid of her, after all I have heard.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, you must try to make a friend of her. It annoys me to see you
    meeting with so little sympathy among those Egertons—Anne freezing you, Sophia
    lecturing, and Fanny worrying. I hope Juliet will be more companionable.”</p>
<p>“I doubt it; but we must go and see her now, for I have a vision of my uncle<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7183-259"/> undergoing, all those tremendous moral
    consequences, which are the invariable result of his having to wait for his
    dinner. First, he falls entirely from the dignity of human nature, and loses
    command of his temper, for a matter of five minutes’ delay, in a material
    enjoyment; then he lowers his intellectual being, altogether below the level of
    the earthly, and shows himself a slave to bodily wants; next, he perverts and
    wastes one of the noblest gifts given to man, the power of administering to the
    pleasure of others, by tormenting every one round him, and horribly reproaching
    the delinquent who causes the delay; then, as to his duties as a husband and a
    father, he of course fails,—but I will not go on, for I see you are laughing,
    Stephen.”</p>
<p>“As I always do at your extraordinary system of analysis. However, let us hurry
    home, by all means, and prevent the deterioration of Mr. Egerton’s moral
    nature.”</p>
<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7183-260"/>
<p>They met Fanny in the hall at Rookcliffe, where Aylmer was at present
    staying.</p>
<p>“Juliet is arrived!” she exclaimed; “she has been asking for you, Millicent, but
    now you must wait till she comes down to dinner, for she has gone to dress.”</p>
<p>Millicent went to her room, and the indescribable gloom which had for the time
    been dispelled by Aylmer’s gay conversation, returned upon her with redoubled
    force. When she rose to go to the drawing room she paused a moment ere she
    passed the large mirror which reflected her figure; her cheek was pale, and her
    countenance devoid, for the time, of the bright, lively expression which formed
    its great charm. She still wore mourning for her father, and the peculiar
    truthfulness of her character made her at all times dress with a severe
    simplicity, which, just as she intended, did not enhance her beauty. She could
    not endure to use any art or forethought<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7183-261"/> in
    order to make herself seem other than she was; and now, as she looked at her own
    unpretending appearance, she sighed, while she murmured—</p>
<p>“Aylmer would surely have wished for a fairer bride!”</p>
<p>She did not know how much, at that very moment, was lovely in her face as its
    expression shadowed forth the feelings of her generous heart, nor even how
    pleasing in the sight of all were those large brown eyes and the soft hair,
    almost of the same colour, shading the pale, quiet brow. Yet, certainly, there
    was a strange contrast between herself and the radiant figure that met her gaze
    as she entered the drawing‐room. She started back almost terrified at the sight
    which presented itself—either she was dreaming, or there was before her the
    exact counterpart, the living embodiment of the pictured figure in which Aylmer
    had represented his ideal—the countenance was not the same, but the dress, the
        attitude,<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7183-262"/> the flowing hair, the head
    turned round with the same studied grace, all combined to render the resemblance
    most striking. In the midst of that half‐darkened room she stood, the dark oak
    furniture and heavy crimson curtains forming an admirable background, clothed in
    a dress of the purest white, falling in soft folds around her—no ornament except
    her own magnificent hair, which was allowed to wave in golden masses, so as
    almost to veil the fair face, with a defiance of all ordinary customs which
    seemed quite admissible in one so beautiful. And the countenance, (alone unlike
    the bright vision of the artist’s dreams,) how marvelously lovely it was! a
    beauty not to be described, it dwelt so much in the softness and sweetness of
    her expression, and the dazzling brilliancy of her large beaming eyes. Then the
    perfect grace of her slightest movement, were it but the gentle falling of the
    delicate hand<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7183-263"/> and arm, or the singular
    lightness of the step, with which she glided forward, seeming to carry light and
    beauty wherever she went—the whole effect was so perfect, that it never conveyed
    the idea of what was, in fact, the truth, that her every attitude, and look, and
    action, were the result of the most studied calculation.</p>
<p>A terrible snare to Juliet Egerton had been her great loveliness. She had
    delivered herself up to the evil influence, it has the power to exercise without
    a struggle. The one sole object of her life, was to gain all the fair gifts of
    this world which beauty had the power to procure for her,—universal
    admiration—the praise of men—the love of many hearts. Self was with her all in
    all. So soon as an idea, a wish, a feeling rose in her mind, it must straightway
    be gratified at any cost; the consequences to others were never to be thought
    of, and her great natural talent, her subtle, intriguing mind ably assisted<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7183-264"/> her in carrying out whatever she designed to
    accomplish.</p>
<p>Her present return to Rookcliffe was, she well knew, most opportune for the
    execution of a design, which had for some time been powerfully agitating her
    mind, and which, in a singular manner, affected the interests of those now
    present with her.</p>
<p>It was only for a few brief instants that Millicent Grey looked upon her in
    silence, but in that space she had time to observe that the meaning look, in the
    splendid eyes of Juliet Egerton, which so remarkably imitated the expression in
    the fair face of Aylmer’s ideal, was turned upon her own future husband, whilst
    his gaze was riveted upon her cousin’s countenance in evident admiration.</p>
<p>Quickly, however, the picture full of life and interest which they presented thus
    grouped, dissolved away at the sound of Mr. Egerton’s voice.</p>
<p>“Come, Millicent, and make acquaintance<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7183-265"/> with
    your new cousin.—Juliet, this is our dear Millicent.”</p>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="lat">Pro tempore</foreign>, Miss Grey,—<foreign xml:lang="fre">bientôt</foreign>, Mrs. Aylmer,” said Charles.</p>
<p>Juliet instantly passed from her striking attitude to another no less graceful,
    with arms outstretched to embrace her new relation. She glided towards her;—in
    the softest and sweetest of tones expressed her delight at meeting her, and when
    the first few sentences had passed between them, wound her arm round her neck,
    and drew her gently back to the spot where Aylmer stood. Millicent could not
    account for it, but she felt that she infinitely preferred the Siberian shake of
    Anne’s elegant fingers, or the stern grasp of Sophia’s hand, to the warm embrace
    of Juliet. She answered gently and kindly to her enthusiastic expressions of
    pleasure, and then slipping from the soft twining arms, took refuge at Aylmer’s
    side. He scarcely heeded her, so intent was his gaze on Juliet,<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7183-266"/> who now stood bending over a table, apparently
    engaged in examining some object that lay upon it.</p>
<p>“Is it not extraordinary how she resembles the picture of your ideal?” said
    Millicent to Aylmer, “and yet you never saw her?”</p>
<p>“The likeness has struck you also, then,” exclaimed Aylmer, quickly; “it is
    indeed most remarkable. What a strange coincidence!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps no coincidence,” said the soft musical voice. They could hardly tell who
    spoke, for Juliet had not turned her head, yet the tones were hers, and her
    hearing must have been singularly acute to have caught the words of their
    whispered remark. Aylmer looked bewildered, and Millicent felt a strange terror,
    as though she had suddenly been brought in contact with one of those dangerous
    magicians of whom we read in the German tales, who are so wonderfully beautiful,
    and so full of subtle wickedness.</p>
<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7183-267"/>
<p>Aylmer had no time to ask an explanation, for they now went to dinner. Juliet sat
    opposite to him, and engaged his whole attention, as in truth that of all
    others. She monopolized the conversation, and spoke well and brilliantly. She
    talked only of Italy and the fine arts,—of music, but chiefly of painting, and
    that with a wild enthusiasm which lit up her charming face with redoubled
    beauty, and kindled the very souls of her hearers.</p>
<p>“You talk so like an artist, Juliet,” said Charles, “that I begin to be
    suspicious of the contents of some large boxes I saw among your packages. Pray,
    do they contain your own performances as a <foreign xml:lang="ita">pittrice</foreign>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my own despair that is embodied on canvas,” she answered, with her gay
    ringing laugh, “for it is nothing less than despair, to find how impossible it
    is to give a material existence, to the fair visions of one’s dreams.
        <emph>You</emph> can never feel this,” she<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7183-268"/>
    continued, suddenly turning and fixing her large eyes full on Aylmer’s
    countenance.</p>
<p>The great peculiarity of her beauty was the singular contrast of those eyes, so
    dark as to be almost black, with her golden‐coloured hair. She well knew their
    power when, as now, she fixed them with their intense gaze on the face of
    Aylmer.</p>
<p>“Indeed you are mistaken. I know the feeling of which you speak right well. The
    pictures of my dreams, are not more like the reality, than the glowing
    landscapes we sometimes fancy we see, among the sunset’s radiant clouds, are
    like the earthly scenes of rock and stone. I suppose no painter ever was or
    could be satisfied with the outward expression of those beautiful shapes, that
    pass before his spirit, any more than the poet is content with the words into
    which he seeks to infuse the fire of his heart, or the composer, with the notes
    in which he would breathe out his soul’s harmony.”</p>
<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7183-269"/>
<p>“Doubtless, but were it not so, there would be no arriving at perfection,” said
    Juliet.</p>
<p>“It is the struggling of the soul to beam through the thick veil of this mortal
    body,” said Millicent: she spoke so low that Arthur only heard her.</p>
<p>“You must tell me how you knew that I was an artist?” said Aylmer to Juliet. She
    made no answer, but the large eyes still gazed on him with a look too strange
    and intense, to seem bold,—he preferred that look to an answer,—it was plain
    that some mystery existed in her mind respecting him, which awoke his interest
    and curiosity, to the uttermost.</p>
<p>“At least you will let me see your own pictures. I feel sure they are
    striking.”</p>
<p>“To‐morrow,” she said, and resumed a more general conversation.</p>
<p>She seemed bent on making a conquest of Millicent, and addressed her continually,
    but chiefly on subjects with which it was<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7183-270"/>
    impossible she should be acquainted, so that the contrast between Juliet’s
    animated remarks and her cousin’s quiet answers, was the more striking. To say
    the truth, Millicent had never been so dull or so incapable of conversing at
    all. Her wonted vivacity seemed unaccountably gone,—she was humbled and subdued,
    she knew not why. Aylmer more than once looked at her with an expression of
    disappointment, for her light‐hearted cheerfulness had been a great attraction
    to him.</p>
<p>In the evening he sought especially, to find an opportunity of asking Juliet an
    explanation, of her mysterious resemblance to his picture, but this she seemed
    determined he should not have. Once only she was alone when he came near her,
    and then starting up, she went to the piano with a smile which invited him to
    follow. She sat for a few moments, passing her hands dreamily over the keys, as
    though gradually losing con‐<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7183-271"/> sciousness of
    where she was: then suddenly she burst out into a very flood of song, as
    singular as it was beautiful. Her voice was not very strong but strangely sweet,
    and she knew how to throw into it a passionate earnestness, which agitated every
    heart that heard her. Aylmer was perfectly entranced,—he entreated her to go on
    song after song, and she seemed unwearied, and carried away from all around her,
    as any bird that carols in the high clear air.</p>
<p>Millicent sat, meanwhile, in a large armchair near the fire; she crouched down in
    it as though she would have hid herself, and sought a shelter. Arthur was placed
    behind her; his head rested against the chair on which she reclined; neither
    spoke, and so passed the evening. They were to separate at last for the night.
    Mr. Egerton systematically marshalled his troop, and presented each individual
    with their candlestick, as though he were arming them, for some important<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7183-272"/> combat;—it was Juliet’s turn, and she came
    gliding in her white robes from the darkened part of the room where the piano
    stood. Her eyes turned with a beaming glance on Aylmer,—her lips but half
    opened, to murmur a soft <foreign xml:lang="ita">buona notte, dormi
        bene</foreign>! and the bright figure disappeared on the dark threshold. He
    stood rooted to the spot, so lost in thought that he did not perceive his young
    bride at his side, waiting to wish him good night.</p>
<p>It was strange that Millicent had not felt the faintest pang of jealousy towards
    Juliet. Her perfect guilelessness, and the trusting simplicity of her character,
    seemed to save her from the most miserable peculiarity of the woman’s nature.
    She judged Aylmer by herself,—true and unchangng as human heart, may be, was
    hers, in its deep love for him, and so she believed of him. He was her promised
    husband: surely nothing could ever make him other than her own. It was<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7183-273"/> natural that his artist’s eye should be
    charmed with Juliet’s beauty, his musical ear ravished with her exquisite
    singing, but his heart’s affection she thought was not the less given to her by
    voluntary choice, by solemn word and promise.</p>
<p>She stood lifting up those trusting tender eyes to his thoughtful face, but not
    till she extended her hand, and whispered her earnest “Good night,” did he
    notice her presence. Then, as he looked down and met that sweet smile, that
    loving gaze, one less guileless than she was might have trembled to see how the
    blood rushed to his forehead, under the remorseful sting of recollection,—he
    clasped her hand in his, and his “Good night, dearest Millicent,” was so warm
    and energetic, that it brought tears into those gentle eyes. She went to rest,
    with a lightened heart.</p>
<p>There was another who went to his room that night, with the crushing weight
        that<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7183-274"/> long had lain upon his soul, stirring
    within him as though it were about to be lifted off. There was one who threw
    open his window, who leant far out, faint and breathless, to bathe his head in
    the cold night air. Arthur Egerton was gasping,—panting with hope. Hope the
    forgotten,—the exiled had returned, and was careering a conquerer through his
    soul, casting down the strongholds which despair had built up, undermining that
    mountain of anguish, carrying light to those chambers of gloom where the human
    idol stood on its pedestal and was worshipped,—(albeit, there was no heart for
    him in its bosom.)</p>
<p>There are some characters full of an inherent power and energy, which is of depth
    inconceivable,—who are filled with a terrible capacity for good or evil, which
    is never called into life until some ungovernable affection, fearful in its
    strength, becomes to the man a very principle of existence,<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7183-275"/> and the latent force comes forth to work the will of
    this new master. It was so with Arthur Egerton; his fiery poetic soul, his
    intensely feeling heart, his strong sound intellect, had all been of late turned
    into one channel, all had been given to spend, and to be spent, in the love of
    Millicent Grey; and now, powers of which he had known nothing, and which might
    well have appalled himself, had he known them as they were, powers to resolve
    and to execute, to work evil, if in evil there were hope,—to make a path on the
    hearts of his fellow‐creatures, if none other might be found, were rising up
    within him, armed and ready, to aid and abet him, in the one object for which he
    lived, the attainment of her love, as she loved Stephen Aylmer. There had been a
    time, brief as those radiant moments, when the sun bathes the world in light ere
    it sinks to utter darkness, when had believed she loved him. None had ever
    looked on him with the tender pity she had<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7183-276"/>
    shown, and this deceived him, so that to him who never had known the unutterable
    sweetness of human affection (for he was repulsive to the very mother who bore
    him,) brighter, dearer, more inconceivably precious than mortal words can tell,
    was the thought that he, the wanderer and outcast, had found in her true heart a
    home.</p>
<p>This dream had been dispelled, how utterly! Not many weeks after Stephen Aylmer
    passed the threshold of the old Hall at Rookcliffe, in Millicent’s first look of
    affection on another, Arthur understood that she had never felt for him aught
    save barren pity, and straightway in that hour the fair, sweet hope he cradled
    in his breast, died in the agony with which a slaughtered man expires. So long
    as it lay within him a corpse, making a charnel house of his soul, he had but
    one thought,—the thought that has been dreary yet sweet comfort to most of us,
    at least once in a lifetime, that the<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7183-277"/> hour
    must come when he would go to lay down his head on the breast of his mother
    earth, and rest from this tyranny of wretchedness. But hope had revived; faint
    as the faintest streaks of dawn, that give the far‐off promise of a future day,
    were the indications of a possible change which might cast back Millicent upon
    his unbounded love, a poor lost outcast, desolate herself, as he was
    desolate;—but they were enough to rouse in hope, the clinging tenacity of life.
    It had started, breathing, gasping, from its tomb and with it Arthur lived
    again. He lived again a new life, as it were, which, with all its capacity, its
    energy, its power, was to be devoted to this one sole object,—that he might feel
    again as he had felt when he believed she loved him.</p>
<p> He was almost terrified at the indomitable strength he felt within him to
    overthrow all obstacles, to work by any means for this his heart’s desire.</p>
<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7183-278"/>
<p>Arthur Egerton had neither hope nor love out of this world, which could induce
    him to feel that there is but one thing to be ardently desired on earth, even
    the preservation of the soul’s rectitude and purity, but rather having delivered
    up his spirit to the adoration of one earthly good, it seemed to him a noble
    thing to offer in sacrifice to it, if need were, even the very dignity of his
    moral being, his very honour and integrity. He had an instinctive consciousness
    of this great truth, that no personal gratification can be obtained without
    departing from that fixed standard of right, in which one of the first
    principles, is the immolation of self for the good of others.</p>
<p>But nothing is more easy than to render crime poetical, Arthur’s gift of genius,
    hitherto wasted, was now perverted, and cast a most false glow over his deep
    selfish love. It made his heart throb with a powerful delight, to feel that not
    only he<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7183-279"/> would compass earth for her, and
    trample on whosoever stood between them, but that he would not withhold from her
    he deemed worthy of his uttermost affection, even to the gift of his soul’s
    righteousness and honour. He must be patient, but patient with an invincible
    purpose standing like an armed warrior at his side. That which he called destiny
    seemed working for him;—he would step aside, and watch as a tiger for his prey,
    and when the events he expected had done their part, then would he rush in to
    effect all that might remain unaccomplished of his life’s desire. So now betake
    thee to thy troubled sleep, most wretched man!—for the thoughts of this night
    shalt thou repent thee yet, in sack‐cloth and in ashes, sprinkled on thy fallen
    head by the cold hands of the dead.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p><hi>THE</hi> morning light brought Juliet Egerton fairer than ever before the
    eyes of Aylmer. She came bounding through the glass door of the breakfast‐room,
    her hands full of flowers, radiant and bright as a type of the morning itself.
    She stopped, and held them up in triumph just where the sunshine was streaming
    into the room, so that the golden rays flashed on her waving hair, and lit up
    her brilliant eyes. Her clear voice sounded a gay good morning to<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7183-281"/> all; but to Aylmer there came a few words of softest
    Italian, heard by himself alone.</p>
<p>It was not wonderful if this dazzling figure shut out from his eyes that other so
    gentle and nunlike, that sat patiently admiring her beautiful cousin. And yet
    captivated as Aylmer certainly was by Juliet’s remarkable loveliness, it was not
    her outward fascination which had already so powerfully drawn him towards
    her,—it was the evident interest springing from some mysterious source which
    existed in her mind for him. He could not account for it. He was certain he had
    never seen her before, yet he felt that they were not strangers, he felt that he
    was known to her in no common way. It was impossible but that this conviction
    should deeply occupy him,—it caused him to scrutinize her every look and
    gesture, and each one of these movements, as he watched her, seemed more
    graceful than the last, swiftly drawing<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7183-282"/> out
    his soul in worship to the Beautiful there present in her. As the day wore on,
    there was a smile of indescribable triumph on the face of Arthur whose eyes
    followed Millicent Grey wheresoever she went.</p>
<p>Aylmer had petitioned that he might see Juliet’s paintings; but she refused to
    show them till a room had been appropriated to her use as “studio,” where she
    might arrange them in suitable lights, and where, hereafter, she might paint
    undisturbed.</p>
<p>This was not done till late in the afternoon; and the whole morning he sat
    entranced with her voice as she sang or spoke to him in her liquid Italian.
    Still, he was never alone with her: she was constantly at Millicent’s side.
    Juliet would look from Aylmer to her at times with an air of melancholy
    interest, and seemed anxious to draw her into conversation; but poor Millicent
    never appeared to so much disadvantage. And had Aylmer been less<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7183-283"/> blinded he would have seen how artfully Juliet’s
    remarks were calculated to produce this effect.</p>
<p>Millicent had left the room, and Juliet, who stood thoughtfully looking after
    her, turned to Sophia.</p>
<p>“It is strange, I do not think you have described Millicent in your letters at
    all as she is. Charles and the rest of you used to speak of her charming
    vivacity and cheerfulness. She seems to me possessed of none at all. She is so
    very—I hardly know what to call it—I should say sad, if that were not
    impossible, with so bright a fate as hers.”</p>
<p>“Out of humour will express it, I have no doubt,” said Anne, who, by some
    conjuring trick of a mental nature, invariably transferred her own faults to the
    possession of others.</p>
<p>“Millicent is spoilt,” said Sophia, in her usual sententious manner.</p>
<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7183-284"/>
<p>“What has spoilt her?” asked Juliet. Sophia looked with phlegmatic prudence to
    the corner of the room, where Aylmer sat reading, and paused in her answer.</p>
<p>“He does not hear—he is too distant from us,” said Fanny, eagerly. Her lively
    curiosity condescended to the most insignificant material for an aliment; and
    she was bent on hearing Sophia’s definition of the change in their cousin.</p>
<p>“It is the prospect of her marriage which has spoilt her; she has never been the
    same creature since. I suppose she is much elated by it, though how any one can
    be elated by the entire loss of their independence, and the subjection of their
    will to one of their fellow creatures, on a mere equality with themselves,
    passes my comprehension; but, certainly, I had trusted Millicent was beginning
    to profit by my instructions, and now she has eyes and ears for none but Mr.
    Aylmer. I presume she imagines herself perfect since he chose her.”</p>
<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7183-285"/>
<p>“She has not much to be proud of, I can tell her,” said Anne, with her habitual
    sneer. “If ever a man was driven into a marriage, he was. Colonel Bentley never
    rested till he made up the match; and I only wonder Stepheu Aylmer was so easily
    led.”</p>
<p>“Dear Anne, do be careful, he will hear you,” said Juliet, with her soft voice,
    by no means so low pitched as usual, and a gleam of triumph in her eyes, as she
    saw that she had effectcd her object, and that his sudden movement showed he had
    heard these remarks.</p>
<p>The painting‐room was arranged at last, and the whole family assembled to see
    Juliet’s pictures. They were large oil paintings, chiefly copies from the old
    masters. Aylmer was struck with surprise at the sight of them; although she had
    not in the remotest degree attained to his own excellence in the art; they were
        yet<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7183-286"/> so full of original genius that he was
    delighted. He spoke his approbation strongly.</p>
<p>“It is plain you are but a beginner,” he said, at last, “but with energy and
    perseverance you may attain to a high degree of perfection.”</p>
<p>“I can do nothing unaided,” said Juliet. “In Italy I never could work unless my
    dear old master were at my side to call out ‘<foreign xml:lang="ita">corragio</foreign>’ every moment, and to fill me by his enthusiastic words
    with what he called ‘<foreign xml:lang="ita">l’anima Italiana</foreign>.’ I wish
    you were Italian and a painting master,”. she added, turning her bright peculiar
    glance, with its sudden impulse, on Aylmer.</p>
<p>“I will be both to you,” said Aylmer, earnestly.</p>
<p>“Do you mean what you say? I may take you at your word? Oh, how gladly! But, for
    you, is it not a rash offer? Think of the long hours when the master must guide
    the pupil’s powerless hand. Is it <foreign xml:lang="ita">davvero</foreign>?”</p>
<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7183-287"/>
<p>“<foreign xml:lang="ita">Davvero</foreign>! I do mean what I said most seriously.
    I will be your master. You could have none here, and I cannot see such a talent
    left uncultivated.”</p>
<p>“Then the office is upon you beyond recall. Oh, how thankful I am that I shall
    yet be a painter!” Juliet looked up as if she had no thought but enthusiastic
    delight at the prospect of being assisted in her pursuit of her favourite
    art.</p>
<p>“Indeed, Mr. Aylmer, I shall be very glad if you will kindly give my daughter a
    few lessons in your leisure moments,” said Mr. Egerton, who had an inconceivable
    aversion to the class of individuals whom he was wont to term generally
    “Monsieurs,” and who infested his house at the period of the Miss Egertons’
    education. Like most Englishmen, who have never left their own country, he was
    under the strong conviction that they were all rascals, and felt profoundly
    uneasy about the silver spoons, whenever they were asked to luncheon.</p>
<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7183-288"/>
<p>“How many leisure moments has Aylmer had of late, Millicent?” said Charles, as he
    stretched himself in the luxurious arm‐chair, provided for Juliet’s future
    accommodation. “Of course the time when he is occupied with you must be said to
    be devoted to business. An engaged man goes to his duty as regularly as a clerk
    to his desk, for so many hours a day. I have no doubt you make the work as
    pleasant as any could,—sweet little Millicent,—but commend me to my
    freedom.”</p>
<p>This was certainly not a pleasant speech for Aylmer, and, after the manner of
    most men, he visited his annoyance on the unoffending. He glanced, half angrily,
    at Millicent, and turned from her with a movement of impatience. There is a
    French expression, which alone can render Millicent’s feeling at that moment
        “<foreign xml:lang="fre">ce mouvement lui serra le cœur</foreign>.” She felt
    dreary and chilled with a longing to take refuge somewhere<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7183-289"/> hid from all eyes; and, at once, as if answering to
    her secret thought, a hand drew her gently down on a seat, in an unnoticed
    corner. She looked up with a glance of humble gratitude, (for we are mostly
    humble in sorrow,) to him whose kindness was so opportune, and met the gaze of
    Arthur full of tenderest pity. Already, then, their offices were changed: he was
    the consoler, and she the afflicted, and the thick loud beating of his heart, as
    he thought upon it, might almost have been heard through the room.</p>
<p>“Well, now we shall leave Juliet in undisturbed possession of her studio,” said
    Mrs. Egerton, as she rose and kissed her handsome daughter with proud
    satisfaction. She was truest to the woman’s nature in her overweening indulgence
    of this favourite child. They all left the room; Aylmer held the door open for
    the ladies to pass, for Charles and Arthur had gone out<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7183-290"/> together. Millicent looked back, thinking he was
    following her, but he stood gazing on Juliet, as she bent over her easel.
    Millicent heard the door close: he had remained with her cousin.</p>
<p>“I suppose Mr. Aylmer is going to give his first lesson, it will be a real
    pleasure to so enthusiastic an artist as he is,” remarked Mrs. Egerton. “My
    Juliet has such extraordinary talent.”</p>
<p>“Millicent,” said Arthur, in a supplicating voice, which trembled in spite of
    himself, “will you come and walk with me a little while in the garden: it is so
    long, so very long, since we have been together there.”</p>
<p>“Dear Arthur, pray excuse me to‐day, my head aches, and, besides,”—Millicent’s
    tender conscience took the alarm at any equivocation,—“I think I promised,—I
    believe Mr. Aylmer expects me to walk with him.” She could not have left the
    house where he was.</p>
<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7183-291"/>
<p>“Not yet,” murmured Arthur, as he turned away, “but soon, very soon, that heart
    cannot live without affection. Cast out, and deserted, where should she fly but
    to my love, so devoted and unutterable.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, within the studio, a new scene of the drama was being enacted. Aylmer
    had shut the door, and quickly approached Juliet.</p>
<p>“You cannot escape me, now. You must explain the mystery which bewilders, while
    it charms me. I feel in my inmost soul that we are not strangers one to
    another,—yet we met but yesterday!”</p>
<p>“Strangers, no, truly!” she looked round sweetly, confidingly to him, as we look
    on the familiar features of a favourite brother.</p>
<p>“But, then, where, when, how did we meet!” he exclaimed, still more moved. “I
        <emph>know</emph> I never looked upon your face before; do you think I could
    have forgotten it?”</p>
<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7183-292"/>
<p>“Yet I know yours well,” she said, with her sweet smile, “and the tones of my
    voice, you have heard them many times.”</p>
<p>“It struck me so,” exclaimed Aylmer: “the first words I heard you utter, were
    like a strain of well‐remembered music, that long ago had passed melodious on my
    ear. But your voice, as we have all remarked, resembles so strangely that of
    your cousin Millicent, that I fancied it was her tones I recognized in
    yours.”</p>
<p>Juliet shook her head almost sadly, “It is not so, and it were best I should
    resemble her in nothing.”</p>
<p>“Do not let us talk of her, just now,” said Aylmer, impatiently, “but, tell me
    what claim I have upon your acquaintance, I believe I might say your friendship
    and oh! may that claim be a strong one.”</p>
<p>“I knew you were here,” said Juliet, dreamily, as though she were rather wan‐<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7183-293"/> dering back through the regions of the past
    in her own memory, than directly answering his question, “I knew that you had
    come to live near this place four months ago, and I thought it was strange that
    Rookcliffe was my home,—I thought I should come and show you how my soul
    understood the artist‐soul within you, by bringing into actual life the vision
    of your glorious picture,—then I thought that I should tell you all.”</p>
<p>“All! how much may be in that word!” thought Aylmer, with a thrill of
    delight.</p>
<p>“And you will tell me all now, then?” he exclaimed to Juliet; “the time is come,
    as you thought!”</p>
<p>“Not as I thought,”—her countenance assumed an expression of rigid decision,
    which gave it a statue‐like beauty,—“ I will not, I cannot tell now.”</p>
<p>“How!” exclaimed Aylmer; “you surely cannot mean it. This is unkind and cruel.<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7183-294"/> What should prevent you? You said you had
    resolved to tell.”</p>
<p>“Yes! but I knew not then that things would be as they are.”</p>
<p>Ambiguous as was this speech, he understood at once that she alluded to his
    marriage. How the poor heart of Millicent Grey would have died within her had
    she seen the expression of his face,—that of Juliet swelled with triumph.</p>
<p>Aylmer was silent for a few moments, then he looked up with a sort of calm
    sadness.</p>
<p>“Am I to understand, then, that you will never tell me the meaning of this hidden
    sympathy, which draws my soul to you, as though you were some friend of
    childhood, some companion cherished long? Am I to live near you constantly as
    the mere stranger, which, in the common course of events, I should be to you,
    with the feeling half maddening me the while that<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7183-295"/> in very truth we have been and are, although I know
    not by what mystery, friends in no common way? Will you <emph>never</emph> tell
    me, <foreign xml:lang="ita">amica incognita</foreign>, what is the strange,
    sweet link between us?”</p>
<p>“Never,” she answered, in a low, melancholy tone, as though she had caught the
    reflection of his sadness,—“never, <emph>now</emph>! at least not until—yes,
    perhaps the day may come when it will avail you nothing, for good or ill, to
    know the truth, and then, if you wish it, I will tell you,—however, bitter were
    the revelation to myself. But now,”—she seemed to make a violent effort, and
    assumed that air of forced gaiety which is more touching than the wildest burst
    of sorrow,—“there is an interval when we may be as friends together, and none
    shall have any true right to come between as, when we may enjoy that communion
    of feeling which those who have the artist soul alone can know. Yes, that
        communion<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7183-296"/> which I have dreamt of having
    with you this many a long day; there is an interval which may be bright with
    that friendship I had thought was to be ours, <emph>unchanging</emph>. Let us,
    then, forget what past and present, were and are, and I at least will forget the
    future; let us catch the sunbeam while it passes, and make merry with it. It
    will be time to weep when the night cometh,—you know they say the dews fall at
    evening.”</p>
<p>She bounded from him as she spoke, and went to the door, whilst he stood
    motionless with agitation and bewilderment. There she paused, and said, in a
    gentle, beseeching tone,—</p>
<p>“Promise it shall be as I have said. We <emph>are</emph> friends as few have
    been: believe it on my word, and let us for this little time, unmoved by that
    which is, or is to come, enjoy without constraint the intercourse which a
    sympathy of thought, and tastes, and feelings will make as precious as it is<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7183-297"/> rare. Ask no questions, seek no change; be it
    understood that we have met in soul long since, and held much converse, sweet
    and true, together, and now there remains but to snatch these golden moments
    which are passing, and will pass too soon. Promise me!”</p>
<p>“I will do all you choose, it is but too bright a prospect. Make of me what you
    will.” He had hardly spoken when she passed from the room,—her power was
    established.</p>
<p>From that day Juliet Egerton and Stephen Aylmer lived for one another. It was as
    she had said; the scheme of ideal friendship she had proposed to him was carried
    out to its full extent,—he gave up all thought of the future, and abandoned
    himself to the charm of present intercourse. They had much in common in their
    love of the fine arts, and their knowledge of Italian life and habits. It became
    a settled custom<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7183-298"/> that they always spoke
    Italian together, and this shut them up, as it were, into a little world of
    their own.</p>
<p>Their mornings were spent in the painting room, not generally alone. Mrs. Egerton
    was too tenacious of the world’s forms to allow of that, but quite sufficiently
    isolated by the nature of their employment,—Juliet painting and Aylmer
    instructing,—to hold such communion together, as was little dreamt of by those
    around them. Day after day Juliet continued, unmolested, to exercise her powers
    of fascination on her cousin’s future husband, with every variety of art. She
    never did anything like other people, but her undoubted eccentricity seemed
    quite justified by her remarkable beauty, which already rendered her so unlike
    all others. No one ever thought of finding fault with the peculiarity of her
    manners and habits: she was in all things considered quite unique, and that
        bright<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7183-299"/> face won forgiveness by a look, for
    the daring independence with which she followed her own wayward will.</p>
<p>They generally all went to ride together in the afternoon. Juliet was a bold
    rider, and often, whilst they were all proceeding quietly together, she would
    seem struck with some object in the distance, some rock or tree, or opening in
    the landscape, that gave the promise of a fine view, and without uttering a
    word, would cause her horse suddenly to bound away from her companions and
    career at full speed across the country, never pausing till she was lost to
    their sight altogether. Some one must follow her, of course, in these wild
    flights, but Charles, who never allowed his ease or dignity to be compromised by
    such hurried movements, invariably requested Aylmer to take upon himself the
    care of his capricious sister, whilst he remained in charge of the rest of the
    party; and Aylmer joyfully<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7183-300"/> accepting the
    mission, would gallop after her, to find her generally motionless on some rising
    ground, whence she could command the prospect, the horse, curbed by her small
    vigorous hand, standing still as a statue, and herself in an attitude equally
    fixed, having uncovered her head, that the breeze might blow in its freshness on
    her fair face, and sweep from her cheek the long, waving hair.</p>
<p>She never, perhaps, seemed so beautiful as in that position. The picture was
    perfect, and entrancing to a man like Aylmer, the artist; and then as the sound
    of his horse’s steps struck on her ear, the slow turning of that graceful head,
    the glad smile breaking over the face, the soft entreaty to be forgiven the
    wayward fancy, were full of an irresistible charm to him that bowed the strong
    heart of the proud man to be the abject slave of that woman’s will.</p>
<p>Then they would ride on together, talk‐<pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7183-301"/> ing
    with that sweet intimate communion, that converse of soul with soul, which when
    they are united in pure friendship, or in holy affection, has a joy that must be
    a foretaste of that blessed intercourse of the brighter world, when no veil of
    the flesh shall come between the happy spirits whose life of love shall be then
    as now, to love one another.</p>
<p>But the intercourse of Aylmer with Juliet Egerton was not the less delightful to
    themselves—that it partook not of this higher nature; and they would most often
    rejoin their party only at the gate of Rookcliffe.</p>
<p>Again in the evening, half hidden in the recess where the piano stood, the
    promised husband of Millicent Grey sat listening to the enchanting voice that
    was speaking, as he felt it did speak, to his very soul in those wild Italian
    words; nor was he ever for one moment arrested in his fascinated admiration<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7183-302"/> by the fact, that every word and look and
    action of Juliet Egerton’s was the result of the most subtle calculation; for
    this was her special art, that she seemed ever guided solely by ungovernable
    impulse. Woe be to her who uses the powers of fascination given her by heaven
    for the purposes of earth!</p>
<p>By solemn appointment, and for a solemn mission, is their responsibility laid on
    her,—even that with her beauty and her winning manner she may make stern
    goodness lovely in the eyes of men, and cause severe uncompromising holiness, to
    seem a sweet alluring thing; that with that voice of thrilling harmony she may
    sing holy strains to fill the ears too often choked up with a world’s fulsome
    flatteries, and by that soft charm in her aspect and her words, which draws
    after her the hearts of many, teach men to listen and submit themselves the more
    readily, to the sharp exacting lessons of unchanging<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7183-303"/> truth, because one with an angel’s look and tone hath
    spoken them.</p>
<p>But again we say, woe be to her who ignoring or rejecting this her mission,
    degrades her loveliness to slave for earthly hopes, and perverts her gifts of
    manifold allurement, to win for her only an earthly love.</p>
<p>All this while Stephen Aylmer had not an idea of the complete revolution which
    had taken place in his entire being. He knew not that in the secret history of
    his inner life, that change had occurred which colours the whole existence,
    destroying all independence or freedom of will, and which he <corr>had</corr> believed himself incapable of experiencing.</p>
<p>The power terrible in its extent, of an indomitable affection had risen up and
    taken possession of this man, as the wild beast seizes on its prey with some
    tremendous grasp, and now even as the victim lies palpitating and crushed in the
    tiger’s fierce<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7183-304"/> embrace, so did his soul lie
    fluttering beneath the might of this unconquerable love, subdued and powerless
    for evermore!</p>
<p>But he knew it not—he knew that he was living in a rapturous dream from which too
    surely he must wake one day, and therefore strove ever to put from him, all
    thought of that waking and its consequences, till the dark hour should arrive,
    and only sought the more madly to enjoy the present because it was so
    fleeting.</p>
<p>He knew that the presence of Juliet Egerton was life to him, and most bitterly,
    passionately, did he regret that before ever he saw her face, one had come to
    stand between them to shut her out from his life so utterly. But he knew not
    that when the hour of restitution came, and he must go forth from that existence
    of fascination and excitement to take another by the hand, and swear to love her
    only and her truly, until death, then would this new power rise up within<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7183-305"/> him like an armed giant from his ambush, and
    trample down his soul with crushing steps, till truth and honour and compassion
    were cast out from it and the conqueror passion reigned there alone.</p>
<p>He knew not this would be; for though often, as we have said, even with agony he
    regretted, that he was bound by other ties, before that radiant face came
    beaming on his life, he was yet a man of honour, and he never dreamt of
    abandoning his promised bride. He fully intended when the time originally fixed
    for their union should arrive, to fulfill his engagements, and become her
    husband; but meanwhile, since this brief interval was all that was given him of
    the intense happiness he never was to know again, he resolved, even as Juliet
    had said, to give himself up to the full enjoyment of the redeemless present,
    and let no thought of the future darken its exceeding brightness.</p>
<p>It never occurred to him how fearfully<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7183-306"/> he was
    already wronging Millicent by such a scheme; such desertion to the spirit of his
    engagement, and mocking faithfulness to the letter of it. He heard no complaint
    from her lips; gentle and patient, he had learned to persuade himself that she
    was not susceptible, nor keenly alive to the many tokens of neglect, which would
    have called forth such wild jealousy in Juliet, had their positions been
    reversed.</p>
<p>He almost persuaded himself that Millicent was incapable of any very strong and
    vivid feeling, when he compared the quiet proofs of unutterable affection, which
    rose from the still deep waters of her soul, with the glowing words of
    passionate attachment which, under the name of friendship, came bursting from
    the lips of Juliet.</p>
<p>And, besides, whenever the thought came across him irresistibly, that truly this
    entire devotion to another than his promised wife was unjustifiable,—he laid
    this flattering<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7183-307"/> unction to his soul that
    Juliet, likewise, had a distinct claim upon him, at least for these few months,
    in the mysterious sympathy resulting from some strange former intercourse, which
    she had proved to him must exist between them. Her half‐uttered hints in the
    very commencement of their acquaintance had shown him plainly, that, but for
    this unhappy engagement with her cousin, she had come to Rookcliffe prepared to
    find him wholly hers, and to be his own in heart and life.</p>
<p>Of course the Egerton family were not blind to the drama which was being played
    before their eyes, but no one interfered by word or deed, or even by a meaning
    look. There were various reasons for this. Charles having attained, by some
    intricate process, to a most real and enviable insensibility himself, never
    thought that possibly there might be the germs of an agony, even unto death, in
    this working tragedy, for<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7183-308"/> some, if not all, of
    the actors therein. Sweet little Millicent would soon find a better husband, he
    thought, if Aylmer played her false; and meanwhile it was a wonderful
    enlivenment to the old halls at Rookcliffe to have this exciting romance going
    on within them: he would not disturb it on any account.</p>
<p>Further, there was a certain feeling existing in the minds of these three old
    young ladies, his sisters, so perpetually in bewildered amazement that the world
    had not yet seen fit to draw them from their immutable position in changeless
    solitude, which caused them secretly to feel, that they had somehow been
    personally aggrieved by their cousin’s speedy engagement, and although they
    admitted it not to themselves, they did, in fact, look on her probable desertion
    by Aylmer as a retribution justly due to them. They, too,<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7183-309"/> would not have disturbed the course of events for any
    inducement whatever.</p>
<p>In the heart of Mrs. Egerton the absorbing love of the child least worthy of it,
    had left room for no other feeling.</p>
<p>She saw that Juliet had won the heart of Aylmer, and that she herself in return
    seemed devotedly attached to him; therefore the mother ardently desired their
    union, and was careful to promote their intercourse. Aylmer was, moreover,
    precisely the husband she wished for Juliet; rich, talented, and fond of
    continental life. As for Millicent, Mrs. Egerton had never quite forgiven her
    for having come, with her bright, sunny face, and her clear, vigorous mind, to
    contrast so unpleasantly with her own world‐worn, artificial daughters, and,
    “indeed,” this fashion‐taught woman was wont to think, “Millicent had always
    shown herself very independent of her care and advice,—so now, if she lost
    Aylmer’s affec‐<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7183-310"/> tion as speedily as she had
    won it, it was her own affair and she must even make the best of it. As for her,
    she must look after her own child’s interest.”</p>
<p>Mr. Egerton would have been obtuse, indeed, had he not perceived that there were
    storms brooding in the atmosphere round him,—storms where she, whose guardian he
    was called, was fast making shipwreck for ever; but, really, while the cook
    persisted in sending up such abominable <foreign xml:lang="fre">entremets</foreign>, he could not think of anything but having him taught
    better, or procuring another. He did believe that was the best plan, to send him
    off, and have another from Paris; but then his <foreign xml:lang="fre">pâtés de
        foie gras</foreign> were capital; no one could excel him, there was the
    difficulty. As to love‐making, they must settle it among themselves: he had had
    enough of it in his own time, but he was done with it long ago. Indeed, he
    wished he had never begun. There was<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7183-311"/> his
    brother, the General, what a comfortable old bachelor he was! nothing to trouble
    him, no one to think of but himself, and what a cook <emph>he</emph> had!</p>
<p>So ruminated the head of the house, and so speculated the various members of his
    family, whilst slowly and surely stealing along, the great agony of Millicent
    Grey came forward to meet her on the pathway of life.</p>
<p>But, oh! Arthur Egerton! what a glorious opportunity was here afforded you, of
    proving how noble and how bright a thing the human soul may be, when strength is
    given it to suffer for the weal of others! Why did you not come forward in this
    her hour of betrayal and friendlessness, armed with the energy and zeal of your
    deep love, to interpose between her and the fierce blow that was descending on
    her, by receiving it on your own heart? Yes! by the holocaust of your life’s
    affection, you might have<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7183-312"/> saved her now: you
    might have won back for her the happiness that is flitting fast away: you might
    have given up the dear hope that exists for you, in the agony of her desertion,
    and with the strong words of truth and rectitude, awakened that man from his
    ignominious dream, to see how peerless is that true heart he is breaking, how
    unworthy her, for whose sake he is so miserably fallen. You might have saved
    her; Arthur Egerton, you might have thrown down the stronghold of your own
    solitary hope, into which you suppose life and its joy are gathered, and from
    the melancholy ruins built up again the tottering fabric of her happiness, now
    shaking to its very centre. And who so blest, (not with earth’s blessing,) as
    yourself, when having thus restored her to her well‐beloved home, in another
    heart than yours, she went forth to live, and to enjoy, and to forget you in
    your bitter solitude!—yes, who so blest, for<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7183-313"/>
    in your soul of earthly light bereft, would shine the glory, ripe with promise,
    of that deed wherein you immolated self on the altar of the Faith which speaks
    of holier love, and higher hope, and more enduring joy!</p>
<p>But, to an earthly affection you have delivered up your spirit, and the darkness
    of earth has closed in round it,—mists, arising from the dust out of which your
    mortal frame was taken; so, cowering back in the shadow, you sit watching with a
    keen cruel eye, till flung out by remorseless hands into the desert of hope and
    of affection, you hope to find that helpless child, compelled to seek a refuge
    by your side!</p>

<head>CHAPTER I.</head>
<p><hi>SLOWLY</hi> along the path where she had walked with Aylmer on the night of
    Juliet’s arrival, Millicent Grey went wandering alone. Cold and dreary was the
    scene around her, for it was winter now; and nature without sunshine is like the
    soul without hope.</p>
<p>With a heavy and a lingering tread she walks, her hands clasped on her bosom,
    where the chilled heart beats faintly,—her head bowed down with an earth‐drawn
    gaze, as theirs is bowed whose thoughts unconsci‐<pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7184-003"/> ously are stealing on to the grave, as their refuge best and sweetest.</p>
<p>And now it may be well to see how it fares with her who must thus compassionless
    abide her destiny, and wait in silence the last shock of the fierce passions
    raging round her.</p>
<p>It may seem unnatural, but heart‐sick and full of boding fears as Millicent now
    was, she never yet had doubted Stephen Aylmer. Most guileless and most trusting,
    nothing could have shaken in her the belief that whatever he did was right. When
    she had given up to him her entire and unlimited affection, she did so believing
    him as nearly perfect as any may be on this earth,—herself had, with her warm
    imagination, gilded and painted her idol, and then she fell down and worshipped
    it.</p>
<p>Whatever he said must be truth. She trusted more willingly his words than his
    deeds, and whilst outwardly, with but little<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7184-004"/>
    reserve, he gave free scope to his intense and ungovernable affection for
    Juliet, when alone with Millicent (now a matter of rare occurrence) his manner
    was little changed, as in truth the quiet friendship he had ever felt for her
    remained undiminished. She never caused him any embarrassment by a single
    murmur, for Millicent Grey was most utterly above all jealousy; if she had once
    discovered that for Juliet’s sake he would fain be free of his present
    engagement, she would have given him up at once without a whisper of complaint;
    but to harass him with a woman’s envy of another, fairer and dearer than
    herself, was a petty meanness of which her generous nature was incapable. She
    could not be blind to his devoted admiration of Juliet,—he had himself so far
    explained his preference, for her society by stating to Millicent that there had
    existed a friendship between them formerly in a manner strange and mysterious,
    even to himself,<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7184-005"/> which both desired should be
    continued now,—but still she felt that no intercourse in times past, could
    account for the intense and absorbing interest he evidently took in her
    beautiful cousin. She felt, with what a helpless sinking of the heart, no words
    can say, that Juliet must be more to him than any on the earth beside, and yet
    she believed that it was his earnest desire and prayer that herself should be
    his wife.</p>
<p>She believed this simply because he told her so; repeatedly and constantly he
    assured her of this, as in fact it was the only salve to his conscience at this
    present time, that he should bind himself again and again by his words, to
    fulfill the promise from which his whole heart was shrinking.</p>
<p>She believed that, in some way, he conceived it to be for his happiness that he
    should be her husband, even whilst his very soul seemed drawn to Juliet
    Egerton,—it might be only because he wished to show<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7184-006"/> his gratitude to his uncle by fulfilling the old
    man’s earnest desire,—and when this thought came to the breast of Millicent, it
    brought with it the very chill of death; or it might be,—and sweet as music was
    the whisper of this hope to her—it might be that with all his admiration for
    Juliet’s brilliant talents and beauty, he yet felt he should find more of the
    peace and comfort of domestic life in her society, who, less gifted and less
    fascinating, would more unreservedly give her life to labour earnestly for his
    happiness.</p>
<p>It was with this thought that Millicent lived on; hope clung round that young
    heart and would not quit it. Her own beautiful simplicity and truthfulness
    misled her in this matter; for, judging by herself, it never occurred to her to
    doubt that if Aylmer had ceased to look for happiness in their union, he would
    have come in a plain and straightforward manner to tell her so.<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7184-007"/> Yet though she felt herself constrained to believe
    simply what he told her, and to act accordingly, let it not be supposed that she
    did not suffer with a suffering which no words could adequately render, at the
    daily and hourly evidence of his attachment for another. With all the glorious
    generosity and self‐forgetfulness of a sincere affection, it was herself she
    ever blamed for his unfaithfulness, and all the anxiety which she feared it cost
    him; it was her fault, she thought,—why was she not beautiful and talented as
    Juliet? why was she not more worthy of him? Then he never would have brought
    disquietude upon himself by yielding to the charm of other society than that of
    his promised wife.</p>
<p>This deep humility saved her from all bitterness of feeling towards either Aylmer
    or Juliet. More and more gentle and patient, day by day she shrunk utterly
    within herself, and strove only never to interfere with<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7184-008"/> him, never to annoy him, and but to show in every
    word and action, as in every thought, that she desired his well‐being only, and
    was content to promote it as he thought fit.</p>
<p>So Aylmer, looking on this calm exterior, believed almost that he had mistaken,
    when formerly he thought she was endowed with that most fatal gift—intensity of
    feeling, and solaced himself with the hope which, in his inmost heart, he knew
    to be false, that she was too insensible to perceive the extent of the new
    affection which filled his heart, or to suffer by it. How appalled he would have
    been, could he have looked beneath that veil, which the woman’s pride never
    fails to draw over her suffering, be it what it may; and seen in what a chaos of
    utter misery the poor soul of Millicent Grey was wandering now, tossed to and
    fro from doubt to fear, from present anguish to future dread. She was as one
    haunted with<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7184-009"/> fearful spectres, rising from the
    tomb where all must sink one day, to speak prophetic of its chill and darkness,
    for disheartening fears came ever gliding in, so terrible and phantom‐like, upon
    her fainting spirit, whispering with boding voices of the utter death of all her
    hope and joy, as though they had risen from her future anguish to warn her with
    a foretaste of it. And when at times, despite the hope which could not be torn
    from her youth and inexperience—despite her firm trust in Aylmer’s words, the
    dread stole darkly on her, that even now she might be walking on to the hour,
    when she should be bereft of all,—of earth’s sole good—her right to be the
    guardian of his life—that thought came to her with all the horror which a
    criminal must feel when the sentence of his execution sounds appalling on his
    ear. For be it remembered that, from earliest youth, Millicent Grey had been
    seeking to discover that<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7184-010"/> mysterious satisfaction
    of the soul for which it craves with such insatiable longing—that fulfillment of
    the inborn desire which John Forde had called the “spirit’s rest;” and she had
    believed that this existed only in the blessedness of sweet human love, given
    and received; and that she had found it in the prospect of a union with Stephen
    Aylmer. If this, then, which alone contained the promise of joy or peace, were
    taken from her, where—where should she turn in the bitter cold, the bewildering
    darkness?</p>
<p>It is impossible that the human soul should seek its repose at once in things
    temporal and things eternal; and since on earth alone she had sought to lay down
    that head and rest, when earth came to shake beneath her, as it rocks in its
    convulsion, the far‐off Home of the only Peace had become to her eyes so blended
    with the dust whereon she lay, that it was too dim and shadowy for her to grasp
    its promise.</p>
<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7184-011"/>
<p>But as yet she never let her mind dwell for an instant on such a possible
    consummation. To one thought only did she turn in her sad bewilderment, it was
    her desire daily, increasing to a passionate longing which well‐nigh absorbed
    her, for Stephen Aylmer’s happiness, to make him happy, with or without her, by
    whatsoever means, it might be his wish or will that she should do it. This was
    her one indomitable resolution; this was her polar star, which was to guide her
    through all the raging storms and drifting clouds. Patiently she would wait till
    he should show her how best this might be done. At present he told her plainly
    it was to be accomplished by a union with herself, and on this she relied; but
    if the hour should come when a sacrifice would be necessary, there was, though
    Millicent Grey knew it not, in the generosity of her character abundant strength
    to accomplish it.</p>
<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7184-012"/>
<p>She was waiting now for Colonel Bentley’s carriage; which came almost every day
    to convey her to Milton Lodge. Neither the old man nor Mrs. Hartley had the
    smallest idea of all that was going on at Rookcliffe. He was unable to go there
    on account of his infirmities, and his sister but seldom left him. The only
    change they perceived was that Millicent was with them more frequently than
    formerly. Poor child! they knew not how in her great friendlessness she pined
    for their words of endearment and of kindness, for they both loved her
    sincerely; Mrs. Hartley, especially, had become much attached to her; and
    Millicent fully reciprocated her affection. Yet it had never occurred to her, to
    disclose her bidden suffering to the gentle old lady. A genuine frankness of
    disposition, like that which was the great charm of her character, is perfectly
    compatible with an extreme reserve respecting the inner life of the soul;<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7184-013"/> and this Millicent possessed to an
    extraordinary degree. Besides, it was not from these lips that there would ever
    pass a word, which could call down a censure upon Stephen Aylmer. When Mrs.
    Hartley would ask her how it was that she had become so quiet and so changed,
    for she was often uneasy at the settled sadness which seemed to have dispelled
    entirely her wonted cheerfulness and vivacity, Millicent would answer, with a
    faint smile, “I am growing old.” Then, Mrs. Hartley, pleased to hear her jest,
    as she imagined, would look with a smile upon her young sweet face; but
    Millicent, not the less, had told the truth, she was growing old—living many,
    long dreary years in a day. Once only, Mrs. Hartley, when visiting at
    Rookcliffe, had been struck most unpleasantly with Aylmer’s manner to Juliet.
    Her suspicions were vaguely roused, but she soon forgot them when she found that
    Millicent appeared to take no<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7184-014"/> notice of the
    intimacy between her cousin and her intended husband, and that Aylmer himself
    talked of their marriage taking place at the appointed time.</p>
<p>It was now within a very few weeks of the period originally fixed, and which
    still remained unaltered. Millicent was remembering how, when she last walked
    there with Aylmer, he had been forming plans of taking her to Italy and
    anticipating her delight at all they were to see. Would that bright vision ever
    be realized now? Should she really yet go there with him, as his wife, and
    forget all the horror and misery of these few months, even as we forget some
    frightful midnight dream? Whilst she thought of it and the soft voice of hope
    came stealing on her soul, she perceived the carriage which had come for her,
    winding along the avenue below; it reminded her how they had stood and gazed on
    that which conveyed Juliet to Rookcliffe, and how in that hour her whole<pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7184-015"/> being was subdued by a dark presentiment. She
    shuddered when these recollections came across her, and turned to the house. She
    went to find Aylmer in the hope of hearing from him that he would join her at
    Milton Lodge in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Egerton met her at the open door of the drawing room, and told her he was
    there, adding that she intended herself visiting Mrs. Hartley that day, and
    would reconduct her home. Millicent answered a few words which were heard by
    Aylmer, and she entered the room alone. We have noted elsewhere that there was a
    singular similarity of tone in the voices of Juliet and Millicent: it is a
    common point of resemblance between cousins, and in this instance it was so
    strong that it was not easy to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>Aylmer thought it was Juliet who spoke; he did not raise his head from a drawing
    on which he was engaged, but as he heard<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7184-016"/> the
    step behind him, he murmured in a low tone, “My own Juliet, are you come at
    last? What a dark world this is without you!”</p>
<p>Millicent stood transfixed, as one turned to stone. The voice, the words, the
    deep full tenderness breathing in them, all came to her with a terrible
    revelation. His <emph>Juliet</emph>!—his Juliet! and what was she? Her heart
    seemed to stop its beating, her hands grew cold as ice, her whole frame shook
    and shivered.</p>
<p>Words, she knew not how, came dropping mournfully, quietly from her pale lips,
    “It is not Juliet, it is I!”</p>
<p>If a clap of thunder had sounded in his ears he could not have started more
    appalled. He bounded from his seat, he turned, he looked on her as she stood
    there with her white half‐parted lips, her stiffening hands, pressing on the
    bosom so unnaturally still. The blood rushed to his forehead, and a hatred came
    over him<pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7184-017"/> against himself, a horror of the
    perfidious, base, degrading part he had been playing towards that unoffending,
    noble‐hearted Millicent. He thought not of Juliet then, but only of re‐assuring
    her,—of convincing her that he could not act dishonourably; that he never meant
    to desert her for any other, however passionately he might be constrained to
    love that beautiful being.</p>
<p>He took both her hands in his whilst still she said, with her mournful gaze, “It
    is not Juliet, it is I!” as though she meant to convey some terrible meaning
    with those words,—and hurriedly, anxiously he poured forth in broken sentences
    every assurance he thought would remove the fatal impression his first unguarded
    words had caused.</p>
<p>It was strange that among the various conflicting feelings which naturally
    assailed him then, the man’s pride most predominated, and his main anxiety was
    to prove to her that he could never intend to be so dis‐<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7184-018"/> honourable as to desert her;—first he said, “I
    thought you were Juliet, <emph>my</emph> pretty artist pupil,”—he laid an
    emphasis on the word as if to convince her that it was in this sense only he had
    called her <emph>his</emph>. Strange sophistry of this world’s ways! His terror
    was that Millicent should call his honour in question, and therefore he acted a
    lie.</p>
<p>Then he passed at once to the subject of their marriage, and the more strongly he
    felt his very frame shivering, at thought of thus placing an insurmountable
    barrier between himself and Juliet, the more vehemently did he protest that he
    would not allow it to be one day or hour beyond the time fixed; that he held
    Millicent bound to that period,—that he was longing for the moment to
    arrive—yes, longing. He spoke truly when he said so, for the terror was upon
    him, that if the delay were much longer, he should not have strength to
    accomplish the sacrifice. He did long, that it should be<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7184-019"/> out of his power to fall from the high standard of
    excellence he had set before himself. And Millicent, did she believe him? There
    was a natural <emph>submissiveness</emph> in her mind to his, which made her
    believe that all he said was true as highest truth,—all he proposed just and
    right, as though by holy laws ordained, and this habit of acquiescence in soul,
    to his declared will at all times, made her now smile a faint smile in answer to
    his earnest entreaties that she would not herself be the cause of any delay, and
    she let her hand lie in his as if with the confiding calm of the promised wife;
    but all his strong words had not shaken one moment the load that now lay
    crushing on her heart, and took from her the power of speech or of thought.</p>
<p>Mr. Egerton came in and reproached her loudly with keeping Colonel Bentley’s
    horses waiting so long. Mechanically she turned to go,—it was impossible in her
    uncle’s presence that Aylmer should say more, but he<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7184-020"/> held her hand for a moment, and looked earnestly into
    her face, till he met the gentle, humble look of her large brown eyes, which
    were so like those of a deer, earnest and mournful. She saw that he expected an
    assurance in words, that she would do all he wished respecting their marriage,
    and the instinct of her loving heart made her ever seek, at any cost to herself,
    to say exactly what would please him most. Half suffocated with emotion now, her
    voice became distinct with an effort.</p>
<p>“Stephen, you know that now and always I will do whatever you tell me is for your
    happiness.”</p>
<p>He let her go, saying he should himself come to Milton Lodge that afternoon, and
    when Juliet Egerton entered the room where he was once more alone, a few minutes
    later, she found him with his face buried among the cushions of the sofa, and
    his whole frame convulsed as it seemed with anguish.</p>
<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7184-021"/>
<p>He rose up, and reproached her almost fiercely for having deprived him of an hour
    of that only happiness which was so fast flitting from his grasp; he said:</p>
<p>“Do not ever leave me—do not, while my life endures, take from me that which is
    its light of day!”</p>
<p>He spoke as if his real life was to terminate when he was parted from her, and
    only an existence like to that, vacant and rayless, we lead in the darkness of
    night, remain to him.</p>
<p>Millicent passed Arthur as she went to the carriage—he watched her movements at
    all times with a pertinacity which one less gentle would have resented. He
    caught one glimpse of her countenance, white as marble, and wearing
    unconsciously that look of patient suffering which we sometimes see on the face
    of a child when in bodily pain; he saw her, and the glad smile of exultation
    passed over his lips—by every<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7184-022"/> deepening shade
    of sorrow on her soul, the sunshine of his spirit brightened. How fiend‐like
    does the human nature grow when it is possessed by earthly passion as by an evil
    spirit, and consents to build its fabric of hope on the grave of another’s
    happiness.</p>
<p>She crouched down in the carriage with that bitterly desolate feeling which makes
    us shrink within ourselves—she lay in a sort of mental stupor, watching all the
    trifling objects on the road, and unable to think—she had but one thought
    distinct—she must do whatever Aylmer wished. But why did he wish it? He
    certainly loved Juliet—she was bewildered.</p>
<p>“My pretty Millicent, what is the matter with you?” exclaimed Colonel Bentley, as
    she entered. “You look as if you had seen a ghost.”</p>
<p>“I think I have,” she answered; for surely she had seen the ghost of her
    happiness, which was dead.</p>
<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7184-023"/>
<p>“Child, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing; I was jesting. I am only not very well.” She spoke very fast, as if
    in nervous haste. “I see you are engaged with your newspaper—you do not require
    me now. I will arrange your cushions, and go to Mrs. Hartley till you have
    finished. Where is she?”</p>
<p>“In the next room; but I would rather you would stay with me; you never disturb
    me, little niece.”</p>
<p>“I will come back to you—but you must let me go now.”</p>
<p>She had a longing to lay her aching head on the kind old lady’s knees.</p>
<p>“Well, well, go away to her, then; some consultation on woman’s gear, I
    suppose,—ribbons for the wedding dress, eh, Millicent? Never mind, child, don’t
    trouble your head about them; it will make no difference to Stephen what you
    wear: he will feel just the same, I promise you.”</p>
<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7184-024"/>
<p>She shuddered; what a different meaning she gave to his words from what he
    intended! She passed into the other room, where Mrs. Hartley sat placidly at
    work in her accustomed corner. She too exclaimed when she saw Millicent’s face,
    and asked her if she were ill.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am not well—I am very weary—I wish so much to sit here—at your feet.” She
    took a low seat, and placed it beside her aged companion. She sat down.</p>
<p>“And now may I lean my head against you?” she said. “I long so to rest. If I had
    a mother, how I should have rested now.”</p>
<p>“My child,—my dear child,—what can be the matter with you? You alarm me beyond
    measure!”</p>
<p>“Oh, nothing,—nothing,” said Millicent, faintly. The tone of affection
    overpowered her. She could not bear it.</p>
<p>“My own dear Millicent, this is no illness,<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7184-025"/> but
    some heavy mental distress, which is oppressing you, poor darling! You are the
    very last that should look sad; will you not tell me, love, what grieves
    you?”</p>
<p>She started up in a kneeling posture, and frantically buried her face in Mrs.
    Hartley’s lap.</p>
<p>“Do not be kind to me, Mrs. Hartley—do not be kind to me,” she said; “I cannot
    bear it; be cold and loveless to me, as they all are; kindness kills me now. I
    am so friendless—I am so friendless!” Then the pent‐up agony burst forth, and
    she sobbed with an abandonment it was heart‐breaking to see.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley was appalled, but these wild words were significant enough, as a
    vision rose up before her of the scene in which she had watched Aylmer and
    Juliet together. She understood in a moment what was going on, but she felt
    convinced it was not yet too late. Only yesterday Aylmer had alluded<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7184-026"/> to their marriage, Still the peril was evidently
    great, and she must be prompt if she would save that guileless, loving
    child—this artful coquette should not be allowed to break her heart.</p>
<p>Gently she lifted poor Millicent’s head.</p>
<p>“Take comfort, dearest, no evil shall come to you. You are frightened and nervous
    just now, but I will be guarantee for your future happiness. Don’t think me
    unfeeling if I love you for a few minutes; lie down on the sofa and rest till I
    come back.”</p>
<p>Millicent obeyed unmurmuring. Had Mrs. Hartley been really unkind, she was too
    much subdued and humbled now to feel surprised. She let herself be placed on the
    sofa, struggling to overcome her emotion, and the old lady went to find her
    brother. She wished to give him certain instructions before Aylmer came, that
    afternoon; but she had rather a difficult part to play. She knew that, if she
    told him the truth, he<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7184-027"/> would go off into a
    tempest of rage, and would, infallibly, throw his crutches at Juliet the moment
    she came into the room, accompanied by a few home truths, of an unpalatable
    nature. The only way to manage Colonel Bentley, at any time, was to treat him
    exactly like an ill‐behaved child, to convince him that he was almost bereft of
    intellect, and that nothing but the most unquestioning obedience to the guidance
    of others could save him from committing many frightful acts of insanity.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley went and stood exactly before him; she looked him full in the face,
    he glanced up, dolefully at her.</p>
<p>“Sister, you have come to preach, that is as clear as daylight. What
        <emph>have</emph> I been doing?” His voice passed into a sort of whine. “I
    declare to you, I took not a drop of port wine at luncheon, and <emph>not</emph>
    I who let the cat into the drawing‐room.”</p>
<pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7184-028"/>
<p>“No, but there is a great deal of mischief going on, which you ought to
    prevent.”</p>
<p>“Please to explain yourself.”</p>
<p>“I don’t mean to explain, that would spoil it all. You must just do what I tell
    you.”</p>
<p>“Well, I am sure, there never was a man so tormented. But anything for a quiet
    life: give me my crutches, and tell me where I am to go.”</p>
<p>“Nowhere, you are to sit still just now.”</p>
<p>“To be bullied and driven into a corner, and put out of all patience for people I
    don’t care about, for I know it can be nothing I am interested in. There is no
    mischief here, unless you are worrying on about the cat and the crystal
    vase,”</p>
<p>“So you don’t care about Stephen Aylmer and Millicent Grey?”</p>
<p>“Woman! what are you saying? Give<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7184-029"/> me my
    crutches, I say; what on earth has happened to them?”</p>
<p>“You shall not have your crutches, I put them away on purpose. Now, brother, sit
    quiet, and listen to me.”</p>
<p>“And what else can I do but sit quiet, when you have taken away my crutches? and
    am I not dying to hear what you have got to say, if you would only speak?”</p>
<p>“Well, you wish their marriage to take place, do you not?”</p>
<p>“Do I wish my head to be upon my shoulders, though you seem to think I have not
    got one?”</p>
<p>“Very good, then let me tell you that unless you exert yourself this very day,
    Millicent Grey will never be your niece.”</p>
<p>He made a feeble grasp at his crutches once more, but he was perfectly
    speechless, from astonishment and horror. Mrs. Hartley was glad of it, as it
    enabled her to tell him what he was to do, without interruption.</p>
<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7184-030"/>
<p>“Now, first of all, you are not to know what reason I have for saying this, or
    the meaning of what I am going to tell you to do. It is all a great mystery,
    which would just confuse you, if you were to hear it till you became perfectly
    useless. You are just to listen, and do quietly what I bid you.”</p>
<p>“I will! I will!” he gasped; “anything not to lose my dear little Millicent.”</p>
<p>“That is right; now all you have to do is very easy. When Stephen comes here this
    afternoon, you are to tell him that it is indispensably necessary that he should
    go to London no later than to‐morrow, to see your lawyer about the settlements,
    and that, in order to save you trouble in the arrangements, he is not to come
    back till within two or three days of the marriage, when he must bring down the
    license, and having said all this, you are not to rest till you see him off
    before this time to‐morrow, with a<pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7184-031"/> private
    letter from you to the lawyer, telling him to hurry the arrangements as much as
    he can. Will you do this?”</p>
<p>Colonel Bentley nodded his head solemnly, in token of complete acquiescence: he
    seemed still too much bewildered to speak.</p>
<p>“And you will do it all quietly, not seeming to suspect anything wrong, only very
    decidedly, so that Stephen shall be gone before another day’s done.”</p>
<p>“Sister, I will; you are very wise, and I will be guided implicitly by you, for
    this is an awful business. I am in a regular terror. Be sure you tell me all I
    am to do.”</p>
<p>“That is all,—he will be here soon, so take care.”</p>
<p>She had gone to the door when he called after her:—</p>
<p>“Sister, I am choking with rage.”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t choke, only remember well what you have to do.”</p>
<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7184-032"/>
<p>Mrs. Hartley returned to Millicent who, meantime, like a very woman. was
    reproaching herself bitterly with unkindness and injustice towards Aylmer, by
    thus allowing herself to despair of the affection of which he had just given her
    the strongest proof; when urging their speedy union. What right had she to judge
    from any thing but his own words, distinctly addressed to herself? Was he not
    noble and true? incapable of meanness or deceit? and it was but herself whose
    weakness and folly caused this fear. She had been relieved by her burst of
    emotion from the crushing oppression which had weighed upon her, and in the
    reaction of feeling, her generous heart returned to its boundless unassailable
    faith in the object of its worship. She was terrified that she might have led
    Mrs. Hartley to think any evil of him, by her apparent desolation, and she
    struggled to look cheerful as soon as she came in.</p>
<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7184-033"/>
<p>“I am so glad you have come,” she said. “I am sure you must have come so
    surprised, you must have thought me very foolish, but I am only nervous and ill.
    I certainly have no right to call myself <emph>friendless</emph>, when Stephen—”
    she stopped, and grew pale, she could not go on, when she remembered the tone of
    his voice, as he said, “My Juliet.” Mrs. Hartley stooped down and kissed her
    fondly.</p>
<p>“Don’t distress yourself, dear Millicent, I understand it all. I trust, indeed,
    when you are his happy wife, you will have no cause to say you are
    friendless.”</p>
<p>These were soothing words to Millicent, and, by the time the Egertons’ carriage
    drove to the door, she was seated beside Colonel Bentley and his sister,
    conversing with them almost as cheerfully as usual.</p>
<p>Mrs. Egerton was accompanied by Juliet and Aylmer, and the three between whom so
    awful a struggle was silently going on,<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7184-034"/>
    involving not happiness alone, but life itself, sat down together with the
    friendly words, the calm politeness, which the world demands from us, even when
    our whole existence is at stake.</p>
<p>Aylmer had assumed that wild, unnatural gaiety, which is the surest evidence of a
    heart most ill at ease, but he avoided looking on the face of Juliet, even as we
    shrink from letting our eyes rest on the still countenance of the dead, so
    unutterably mournful in their ghastly rest,—for she was the picture of utter
    despondency: a beautiful picture still, however, that was never forgotten; and
    the downcast eyes that seemed weary of the light of day, showed to singular
    advantage the long dark lashes that shrouded them, whilst the very contrast of
    her present sorrow with her usual animation and brilliancy, gave an
    indescribable charm to her deep melancholy. Millicent was so anxious Aylmer
    should not<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7184-035"/> think he had pained her, that her
    forced cheerfulness confirmed him in his belief, that she had no great depth of
    feeling. When he thought of her having heard the words which himself knew to
    have arisen out of the very depths of a soul devoted to her cousin, and then,
    when he compared her apparent insensibility with Juliet’s evident wretchedness,
    he almost doubted whether he would have strength enough to accomplish the
    sacrifice, which honour compelled him to make to her.</p>
<p>It was impossible for Colonel Bentley to speak to his nephew in presence of the
    Egertons, as an admonitory look of his sister’s reminded him; and, therefore, as
    the visit drew to a close, he told him that he wished him to remain at Milton
    Lodge for dinner, as there were some matters of business which they must discuss
    together. Aylmer looked beyond measure annoyed: he could not endure to lose a
    single hour<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7184-036"/> of that society which was so
    inexpressibly dear to him, and from which he was soon to be for ever separated.
    He remonstrated with his uncle, and said there were various arrangements made
    for that evening at Rookcliffe which required his presence.</p>
<p>“Well,” said Colonel Bentley good‐humoredly, for he was pleased at what he
    believed was a proof of Aylmer’s wish to remain with Millicent, “I will try not
    to be too hard upon you, and you shall go back as soon as possible this
    evening,—but come with me to the next room for a moment, and I will explain to
    you why you must stay a few hours to arrange matters with me.” He took his
    crutches, and hobbled through the folding door which always stood open to the
    other room, followed by Aylmer.</p>
<p>Juliet rose, and sauntered towards a table which stood near the door, but at a<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7184-037"/> sufficient distance to make it seem impossible
    that she should distinguish any part of the conversation, which Colonel Bentley
    and his nephew were holding in a recess of the other room; nevertheless, her
    hearing was acute as that of the serpent which discerns far off the tread of his
    victim. She distinctly heard the old man say, it was absolutely necessary that
    Aylmer should proceed to town the very next day, to complete the arrangements
    for his marriage; and, after a long pause, during which Colonel Bentley became
    furiously impatient, she heard Aylmer reply in a voice of the utmost agitation
    that he had no doubt his uncle was right, and that he was quite ready to go. He
    felt that, intolerably painful as the struggle would be, it was best, perhaps,
    since the effort must be made, that he should at once break from the charm that
    held him as with chains of iron, and escape from Juliet’s presence, before it<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7184-038"/> became impossible for him to resist even
    perjury and dishonour for her sake.</p>
<p>Juliet had gained enough. She walked back at once to her mother, and urged her to
    return home immediately, so as to leave no time for Aylmer to announce his
    intended journey before they left Milton Lodge. She succeeded: Mrs. Egerton and
    Millicent rose at once. Aylmer only came for a moment from the next room to say
    that he must remain, on account of business with his uncle, but that he would be
    at Rookcliffe in the evening, and so they separated. The red glow of the setting
    winter sun had prevented any but Millicent observing the ghastly paleness of his
    face. Her own grew white as snow, when she observed it.</p>
<p>“He is suffering,” she thought; “but how?—for what cause? oh! what shall I do for
    him?” It made her sick at heart to think that one shade of sorrow was on his
    soul. She felt that she would not have sunk or even<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7184-039"/> drooped, if she could have saved him from it by
    enduring herself a world’s weight of misery. But she knew not what to do: she
    was bewildered. She could but go back again and again to his own words. In what
    else was she to trust? She had a melancholy drive homewards. All her sense of
    friendlessness and desolation returned upon her. She felt, by a sort of
    instinct, that the hearts of both with whom she sat were bitter against her. She
    could see in the deepening twilight the glittering of Juliet’s eyes, as they
    settled on her with a side glance of deadly hate, and she trembled to feel so
    utterly helpless, with such a vague dread upon her, she knew not of what.</p>
<p>Juliet seemed anxious to leave the carriage first: when they reached the door she
    sprang into the hall. “Letters, of course,” she said hurriedly, taking up one or
    two that lay on the hall table. She had a large correspondence, and never failed
    to receive some by each post.</p>
<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7184-040"/>
<p>“Ah, here is a letter from Mrs. Wilmot, at Richmond,” she said, looking at the
    address of one, which was half hid in her hand, and speaking both to her father
    and mother, who had joined her as well as Millicent. “I know what it will
    certainly contain.”</p>
<p>“An invitation’?” said Mrs. Egerton. “Yes,” said Juliet, “she wrote to me last
    week that she expected some of our friends from Milan to be with her this week,
    and that she counted on me to come and meet them. I shall be so glad.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean that you will go, my child?” asked her mother, “that you will wish
    to go?”</p>
<p>“I shall undoubtedly,” said Juliet, turning and fixing her eyes on Mrs. Egerton.
    “I particularly wish to go just now.”</p>
<p>“You know best,” said Mrs. Egerton, satisfied that she could not do better than
    leave her daughter’s fate in her own hands.</p>
<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7184-041"/>
<p>“And she shall do as she likes,” added Mr. Egerton, who was beginning to feel
    uncomfortable at the manifold proofs of there being something wrong in his
    household, and who had just sufficient glimmering of what was going on, to feel
    that Juliet’s absence was the event most likely to restore the peace in which he
    delighted. Mr. Egerton always thought himself ill‐used when any distressing
    occurrence took place in his family. Few men had known less trouble, but even
    now he talked of the loss of an infant long ago, as a most unjustifiable
    trial.</p>
<p>Juliet went to her room, and having closed the door, she deposited the letter
    from her cousin in Shropshire, which had passed for that of Mrs. Wilmot, at
    Richmond, in the fire, and proceeded to write a few lines to Mrs. Wilmot
    herself, saying that, if quite convenient to her, she should like to pay her
    long‐promised visit now, as she doubted whether she should be able to<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7184-042"/> come to Richmond later, and at present she had some
    charming new music, which they might try over together, and many interesting
    anecdotes from Milan to tell her. The letter was such as to insure an
    invitation, and she even named the day, in the following week, when she wished.
    to come. It was finished, and despatched by a special messenger to the post,
    before she came to dinner. She was glad to see the family all assembled, that
    they might hear of her journey before Aylmer came to announce his. She said Mrs.
    Wilmot wished her to go on the following Monday, and that she had written to
    accept her invitation, so that her departure was quite fixed. Millicent clasped
    her hands in deep, silent thankfulness; she fancied, in her simplicity, that all
    the sunshine which had passed from her life when the figure of Juliet Egerton
    first darkened the threshold of Rookcliffe, would now come beaming through it
    again, when<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7184-043"/> the fatal influence of her presence
    was gone. Charles looked very steadily at his sister.</p>
<p>“Do you mean to return before Millicent’s wedding?” he asked.</p>
<p>“I do,” was her answer, and the gleam of her eyes on the face of her cousin, was
    frightful in its malice.</p>
<p>Aylmer came in the course of the evening. His first look was to Juliet, as of
    necessity. Her appearance of profound dejection was unchanged; but the next
    glance, even with anxiety, was to Millicent. This was caused by a few words of
    Mrs. Hartley’s. She had followed him when he left the library at Milton Lodge,
    to return to Rookcliffe.</p>
<p>“Stephen,” she said, “I would say one word to you!” He always listened to his
    aunt with deference and attention. “I would simply ask you if you are fully
    aware what a great peril and responsibility<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7184-044"/> you
    incurred when you gained to yourself an affection so fearfully strong as that
    which binds your promised wife to you.”</p>
<p>He was much surprised. Mrs. Hartley spoke with a sternness of manner quite
    foreign to her nature; he felt that she had some deep reason for so doing.</p>
<p>“Does Millicent feel so strongly, aunt? It has seemed to me,—I have fancied,‐that
    she was cold, almost indifferent.”</p>
<p>“Lay no such falsehood to your soul, Stephen; you cannot and dare not believe it
    in actual truth,—or, if you do, trust me, for once, when I tell you, that her
    life is bound up in her love for you. If the love is torn from her, the life
    will go with it. Look in her face, and you will see that it is already trembling
    in the balance. Take heed, the Sixth Commandment may be broken without
    bloodshed,—murder may be done with no wound visible.”</p>
<p>She left him so deeply impressed by her<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7184-045"/> words
    that he resolved, happen what might, to give Millicent the fullest possible
    assurance of affection before he left her, and to ensure her looking forward
    with a happy security to their union. He must lie if he told her he loved her
    now, but he had become so bewildered in the dense mists of many conflicting
    passions, that the outward semblance of truth was all he even strove to
    attain.</p>
<p>Before he had time to announce his own departure, Juliet had told him in presence
    of the assembled family, that she was to go to Richmond the following week.
    Aylmer started with uncontrollable emotion.</p>
<p>“How strange!” he said. “I am likewise obliged to go to London to‐morrow.”</p>
<p>He then resolutely stated, though with an inconceivable effort, that it was in
    order to prepare the marriage‐settlements, and that he should return only in
    time for his wedding.</p>
<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7184-046"/>
<p>“Well, you seem both flying off at once, Juliet and you,” said Fanny, who
    excelled in inopportune remarks.</p>
<p>“But you will not be able to escort my sister,” said Charles, with considerable
    haughtiness,—“she is not to go till Monday, and you leave us to‐morrow.”</p>
<p>“No,” murmured Juliet, who had come with her noiseless gliding step close to
    Aylmer,—“here we <emph>part</emph>.”</p>
<p>She spoke in a low deep tone that struck on his ear like the tolling of a funeral
    bell: he felt as if the darkness of night had come over his life, but still the
    solemn ominous words of Mrs. Hartley recurred to him. It seemed as if in this
    conflict his senses would abandon him. He could only cling to the recollection
    of the resolution he had taken. He was to go so early next morning that he said
    his leave‐taking must be this evening, and he asked Millicent to come and speak
    to him for a few minutes in the inner<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7184-047"/>
    drawing‐room. There he assured her of his entire affection with a tenderness and
    a solemnity which it would indeed have been hard to doubt. The very urgency of
    the case made him act his part to perfection, for his brain was actually
    reeling, and he was half frantic with the mad desire to fling her from him, and
    tell her she never, <emph rend="sc">NEVER</emph> should come between him and his
    own, his only love. Nevertheless, he left her happy, calm, assured as she had
    not been these many long days,—smiling quietly to him whilst she repeated the
    words he dictated to her, containing a renewal of her promise, that on the
    appointed day she would become his wife.</p>
<p>It seemed to her that her long patience was rewarded, and peace was come at last;
    and though for a short time she would gaze upon that face no more, how blessed
    would be their meeting.</p>
<p>So she laid down her gentle head in very great thankfulness that night.</p>
<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7184-048"/>
<p>When Aylmer returned to the drawing room he found that Juliet had disappeared.
    Vainly did he look for her with utter despair in his heart. She was seen no
    more, and the next morning he was to go, without even a farewell.</p>
            </div>

            <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><hi>IT</hi> must be a light heart, indeed, that can wake from the calm oblivion
    of sleep, to begin a new day, without shrinking wearily from resuming the burden
    of existence, so gladly laid down when the night brings its healing rest. Its
    peace and radiant dreams are like a foretaste of the repose eternal, and there
    seems scarce energy to return again to the life‐struggle; but with Stephen
    Aylmer this feeling had deepened almost to a horror of the light of day, when
    the morning broke which was to take him from Rookcliffe, and terminate for ever
    that period<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7184-050"/> of intense happiness, which seemed
    to him now the only hour of real sunshine his life had ever known. The struggles
    of his soul in that dark night had been terrible: now it seemed to him
    impossible to relinquish Juliet, the beautiful, the poetical Juliet, with her
    impassioned spirit and her brilliant intellect, the very type and embodiment of
    all he had ever wished in his wildest dreams to find, as the companion of his
    journey through the world,—the first, the only one who had ever awakened the
    strong, mighty affections of his heart,—who had broken up his life‐long
    indifference and vacancy of soul, to send the deep tides of passionate feeling
    swelling and raging over it. Yes, to give her up, his living ideal, his reality
    of love and joy, seemed a sacrifice beyond his strength; and yet he felt it must
    be,—as we feel that we shall die,—that night shall follow day. It was still more
    impossible that Stephen Aylmer should be a per‐<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7184-051"/>
    jured and dishonoured man,—a murderer, as his aunt had said,—the unpitying
    assassin of the gentle and true‐hearted being he had called and chosen from out
    of all the world, to come and nestle by his side for ever, safe from life’s
    great peril in his sheltering love. This could not be. This alone was dear in
    the chaos of his mind,—he must keep the solemn oath he once had taken, with her
    hand in his, that she should be his wedded wife.</p>
<p>He went out into the cold grey morning: the carriage stood already at the door,
    to convey him to the distant station,—it was fully time, there must be no
    delay,—yet Juliet,—Juliet,—was he never to see her again? It seemed most utterly
    impossible to go without looking on her face once more,—surely she did not mean
    to deprive him of his lawful right, a last farewell. Alas! perhaps, like
    himself, she felt she could not endure it.</p>
<p>Still he wandered into every room where he thought she might be, but found that
        he<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7184-052"/> only shivered at the desolation which
    her absence caused, in scenes where they had been together in joy
    unutterable,—and past! He returned to the hall‐door,—his servant said they
    should certainly be too late, unless they started at once,—but, Juliet,
    Juliet,—to go without seeing her,—he believed he should never see her again,—he
    did not think she would return before his marriage,—he thought rather she was
    going to escape a trial too bitter for her strength,—so that when he left those
    walls which now contained her, all would be at end between them,—it would be as
    though they never had met. He felt rooted to the threshold of that house,—a mad
    device passed through his brain, to send away the carriage and remain. He knew
    it would be utter folly,—that it would cause the discovery of all his
    faithlessness,—that Millicent would learn the truth,—but still,—still,—as soon
    could he let the grave close over the form most<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7184-053"/>
    beloved on earth, without one last look on the cherished features, as he could
    have consented to abandon Juliet without telling her, once for all, that, in
    sacrificing her to honour and justice, he sacrificed all that life held dear.
    Suddenly he recollected that she was going to Richmond,—then he would see her
    there. It was decided,—he would have not done so,—thus much of strength he would
    have had, that he would not have ventured into her presence again, had she given
    him the opportunity, by taking his leave of her for life itself at Rookcliffe;
    but it was beyond what human nature was capable of, as he conceived, that he
    should have gone on through existence without receiving, like a dying man, the
    last words of consolation from the friend, who had been the star of the life of
    joy, now passing from him.</p>
<p>His resolution once taken, he delayed no longer; he flung himself into a corner
        of<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7184-054"/> the carriage, and they drove off at full
    speed.</p>
<p>They were about a mile from Rookcliffe, when suddenly a sight met his eye, which
    caused his heart to bound madly: it was a groom in the Egerton livery, pacing
    slowly along on horseback, evidently in attendance on some one in advance.</p>
<p>Aylmer almost threw himself from the carriage, that he might distinguish whom he
    was following. He was right,—the instinct of his true affection had not deceived
    him. That light, elegant figure, that waving mass of golden hair falling on the
    dark garment, was not to be mistaken. She seemed to let her horse wander at will
    with lingering steps,—she scarce held the bridle,—it hung relaxed from the fair
    hands clasped on her knee,—her head drooped on her breast,—her whole attitude
    was expressive of a profound dejection, which was touching and
        <emph>graceful</emph> to the last degree.<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7184-055"/>
    In another instant Aylmer had flung himself from the carriage, and told them to
    drive on to a certain point, where he would overtake them; they passed on, and
    he was at her side, his arm upon her horse’s neck, alone with her for the last
    time. They walked slowly on; she had not moved, still the head bent down, and
    the flowing hair veiling her countenance completely from his sight. No one had
    ever seen Juliet Egerton weep, nor did he now, yet he believed that golden veil
    hid a face convulsed with anguish. She was the first to speak, but how choked
    the voice, how incoherent the words that usually rung out so clear and
    musical.</p>
<p>“You may have thought it strange and bold, that I should choose to meet you thus
    alone, but I had to tell—it is the last time—never more.” She seemed unable to
    proceed.</p>
<p>“Juliet!” he gasped out. Her sorrow maddened him,—she struggled for composure,
    and spoke more calmly:—</p>
<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7184-056"/>
<p>“I have come here to fulfill my promise, that one day I would tell you all,—all
    of the sympathy that bound me to you, long before your eyes had looked upon my
    face. I could not,—I dared not,—until your fate was in all things too utterly
    decided to be influenced by words of mine; but now I may make a revelation, as
    men do on their death‐beds, for this is the dying day of our friendship, Stephen
    Aylmer.” He could not answer her, but his hand grasped the bridle‐rein
    convulsively.</p>
<p>“Shall I speak then?” she said in her soft thrilling tone; “shall I try to forget
    the present, the bitter unendurable present, and go back over the ages I have
    lived since then, to the bright time of hope when I believed you were a
    heaven‐sent friend?”</p>
<p>“Yes, speak,—speak,—were it but that I may hear your voice, so long as its sweet
    harmony is permitted music to me; speak,<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7184-057"/> that I
    may know all I might have possessed, all I might have been!”</p>
<p>Juliet lifted up her head, and looked on the landscape round her; she seemed to
    throw off all consciousness of present events and cast herself back into the
    past without reserve; she spoke as one over whom glad recollections were
    passing, like the fair visions of a dream.</p>
<p>“Bright Italy!” she said, “bright, sunny, gladsome Italy! as different from the
    dreary winter scene around as the happy days through which we have been passing
    from those which are to come, Stephen! When I first went there, I passed through
    its scenes of beauty and gay amusement as light and free of heart as any on this
    earth. Aylmer, I was what you were many years of your life, I had never seen one
    in this world whom my soul could call—friend. Many there were who professed to
    love me,—many to whom, in truth, I was too dear,<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7184-058"/> —for I must speak the truth now: this is no time for false humility, I must
    tell you all that really was. I must explain the nature of my existence then,
    that you may understand the change you wrought in it.”</p>
<p>“You tell me but what I heard of you everywhere,” said Aylmer: “I know you were
    the worshipped of many hearts.”</p>
<p>“And I was to all indifferent and unloving. I smiled and scoffed most carelessly
    at all. I ever felt that till I encountered one whose spirit could meet with my
    spirit in a communion of thought, of feeling, and of sympathy, I must be
    alone,—and so I was most lonely, with a very world at my feet. One day, I went
    to an exhibition of pictures, most of them were by old masters, some few by
    modern artists. I paused before a splendid painting, which I believed, from its
    vigour, its rich colouring, its deep meaning and sublimity, to be the work of
    one who lived in ancient and more noble<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7184-059"/> times:
    there was a soul breathing through that picture to which my own flew straight,
    as waters long pent up gush forth to mingle with their kindred billows on the
    sea. I fell that he who gave a shape, a form to the noble idea there embodied,
    could have understood and sympathized with the tide of passionate feeling which
    was for ever surging up in my own breast,—and when I remembered, as I believed,
    that he must long since have mouldered in the dust, my heart died within me, and
    I said, ‘Let me go to dust then likewise, for he in whom my soul could have
    found rest has passed from earth before I stepped upon it, and a twin spirit
    like to mine, as his was, shall surely not be found again.’ Aylmer, you will
    think me mad to have spoken thus of one whom I knew only through the dim faint
    medium of that glorious painting; but I tell you truth—for I have ever held that
    doctrine, ancient, I believe, as is the earth<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7184-060"/>
    itself, and universal among many nations, that for every soul which comes into
    this world, another is found to be its companion and twin sister as it were, and
    except they meet while dwelling here, the same weary vacancy possesses both for
    ever. I say this old faith I believe, and I felt that the spirit which had
    conceived that picture was moulded in the same fire as mine, and that none could
    ever have been to it, what I would be!”</p>
<p>“I also believe the same; and I too hold that faith,” said Aylmer.</p>
<p>Juliet continued: “The Marchesa L——, with whom I was then living, was at my side,
    and as I gazed upon the picture, I stretched out my arm to it, and I said—‘Would
    that I could step back over the ages that have passed away since the hand that
    traced those lines has mouldered into ashes! Then would I take it in my own and
    sit down at his feet, and give to him my heart and<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7184-061"/> soul. Then the Marchesa laughed out and said (I
    remember every syllable), ‘You need not go so far, <foreign xml:lang="ita">Giulietta bella</foreign>, for if you will walk with me now across the
    Piazzo, you may take that artist’s hand and sit down at his feet, and give to
    him your heart and soul. He is a living and a breathing man.’ When I heard that,
    Aylmer, I thought no more of myself, but only of the glory of the living artist;
    and I said, ‘He should be crowned.’ Instantly all those around me echoed back my
    words, ‘He should be crowned—he should be crowned as poets and painters ever
    were, and borne triumphant to the Capitol.’ No sooner was the thought thus
    brought to life, than the deed was done.”</p>
<p>“What! it was to you, then, I owed that day of triumph,” exclaimed Aylmer. Her
    bright smile flashed upon him in answer.</p>
<p>“You remember,” she continued, “how a party of the noblest cavaliers, accom‐<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7184-062"/> panied by ladies masked, came to your studio
    and carried you forth to receive the public homage due to your great talent; and
    how one more than all others, closely veiled, presented to you the laurel wreath
    which the old Italian custom awards as the mark of highest honour; and how it
    was by her lips and in her words that you were thanked for having made so
    gorgeous an offering to the <foreign xml:lang="ita">belli arti</foreign>.”</p>
<p>“And it was your voice I then heard?” exclaimed Aylmer; “it was your words that
    sounded to me, then, the sweetest I had ever listened to! I understand it
    all.”</p>
<p>“Not all, as yet—would it were all, in truth. Do you remember, after that, how
    the Marchesa L—— came to your studio day after day to have her portrait taken,
    and how there was ever with her one closely veiled, who spoke with you in your
    own English tongue, to her unknowns. so that we held sweet converse, most
    intimate and<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7184-063"/> close together, which none
    impeded, month by month?”</p>
<p>“Juliet!” exclaimed Aylmer, starting, as though stung by a serpent; “you do not
    mean that you were that mysterious friend whose face I never saw—but who so
    linked my soul to hers, that had I not believed her, as I was told she was, the
    wife of another man, I never would have left Rome, I verily believe, without
    her?”</p>
<p>“And who told you she was another man’s wife? Ugo Bartoli, who, for my sake, now
    inhabits a madhouse on the banks of the Arno; for he loved me, and, like all the
    others, loved in vain. I learned he had told you this, when you suddenly left
    Rome, without even a farewell. But I took no measures to undeceive you then, for
    I knew that we should meet again in England—I knew we should meet, because I
    willed it.”</p>
<p>“And we did meet—but how?” exclaimed<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7184-064"/> Aylmer.
    Suddenly he turned round, with a look almost of fierceness upon her, “Juliet!
    why did you do this thing—why did you dare thus to sport with the destiny of
    both of us? Look what havoc you have made of it! Why did you conceal yourself
    from me? why did you come thus closely veiled, and never tell your name?
    Think—think, had you done otherwise—had I known you as I do now, of all that
    might have been! Oh! it is madness to dwell upon it.”</p>
<p>“Forgive—forgive me!” said Juliet, imploringly, with that tone which the French
    so admirably renders, “<foreign xml:lang="fre">Des larmes dans la
    voix</foreign>;” “it was for a sweet dream’s sake I did it, and I do see all the
    error now; but, then, it was my darling vision. Listen—I heard of you, that you
    adored the Beautiful, in whatsoever shape it appeared before you; and I knew my
    face was fair, I knew that nature had so willed to clothe my soul in a garment
    pleasing to the eye, that if you saw<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7184-065"/> me it
    would be my outward appearance which would draw you to me—but, Aylmer, it was
    your mind and spirit, as recorded in your paintings, which had bowed my whole
    being to your influence, and that which I felt for you, as one noble in
    intellect, great in mental power and energy, filled me with a passionate longing
    that you should, if ever you loved me (I may use the word now, Aylmer, it can be
    but an empty sound between us), that you should love my mind, my soul, my inner
    self, and not the visible form only. For this cause I never let you look upon my
    countenance, but day by day I sent my soul forth, as it were, to commune with
    you; and, Aylmer,—Stephen Aylmer, I sought not for your friendship even thus in
    vain—surely, we were friends!”</p>
<p>“Friends!” echoed Aylmer. “Alas how much more—now, at least!”</p>
<p>“And then you left me; but, as I said, I knew that we should meet; and when I<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7184-066"/> heard from those at home that you had made
    your abode so close to Rookcliffe, to my father’s house, Aylmer, I was weak and
    wild enough to think that so our destiny had been arranged. I thought that I
    should come, who had made my way into your soul, with but the whispering of my
    voice, to claim an entrance there in all the power of that fair aspect which I
    believed was mercifully given me for your sake, and I came—I came—” There began
    to be the greatest wildness in Juliet’s look and gesture now.</p>
<p>“I did come, and I saw you once again: I saw you my <emph>cousin’s
    husband</emph>!” Her voice changed almost to a shriek.</p>
<p>“Oh, what have I to do speaking thus to you! What am I doing here,—what am I
    saying! Let me go—let me go!”</p>
<p>She struck her horse violently as she spoke, and the startled animal attempted to
    bound forward, but Aylmer threw himself upon the bridle and arrested his
    progress.</p>
<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7184-067"/>
<p>“Juliet, hear me,—hear me!” he exclaimed.</p>
<p>Her only answer was—“Let me go,—let me go!”</p>
<p>There was the utmost wildness in her eyes, and something almost of frenzy in her
    tone and manner. With her weak hand she struggled to make him quit his hold on
    her bridle‐rein. Again she struck the fiery horse, and the animal, furious at
    the restraint which prevented him from springing forth, reared and plunged so
    violently that at the risk of Juliet’s life and his own, could Aylmer have alone
    restraincd his grasp. He exclaimed only in a tone almost of defiance—</p>
<p>“Juliet, we shall meet at Richmond!”</p>
<p>His hold relaxed; with one tremendous bound the horse darted off at the most
    fearful speed. He saw but for an instant the flash of her golden hair borne back
    by the wind; he heard but the rustle of her garments, as though one driven by
    the tempest<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7184-068"/> went past, and in an instant horse
    and rider had vanished from his sight, like a beautiful dream which in waking
    hours we cannot recall.</p>
<p>But they met again at Richmond.</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7184-069"/>
            <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head>
<p><hi>THE</hi> period which elapsed between Aylmer’s departure, and that appointed
    for his marriage, was well‐nigh the happiest of Millicent’s life. She was so
    calm and fearless now, living on one bright hope. Aylmer’s words had allayed
    every doubt, chased away every shadow; in her beautiful trust she received from
    them the full assurance they were meant to convey, and the storm of terror and
    anxiety through which she had passed served but to deepen, if aught could
    deepen, the intensity of her affection for him.<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7184-070"/>
    All that her soul desired was centered in the assurance of his. For she still
    believed that the spirit’s rest on earth is in the love of one beloved, and
    nothing doubting that this joy was hers, the measure of her contentment was
    complete.</p>
<p>It was for this very reason that Mrs. Hartley now trembled for her. Even whilst
    her prospect of happiness seemed most assured, this wise friend felt convinced
    that some heaven‐sent blow would come to hurl her from her false unhallowed
    rest. She judged not so from any outward circumstance, but because she had
    deeply studied that Mystery of Love, the chastening of man, which is appointed
    to draw him out of the snare which his own deceived heart sets for him in this
    world. She had learnt that when human souls are so allured by the green and
    smiling earth as to lie down there amongst its flowers, instead of seeking to
    struggle up the steep and narrow path that<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7184-071"/>
    leads to our own home, then straightway is misery sent to drag them through fire
    and water—the fire of tribulation and the deep waters of sorrow—on to the
    Paradise above.</p>
<p>She saw that Millicent was resting now so utterly in this world’s good,—its
    highest good truly, but still an earthly treasure only, that she felt sure by
    some violent wrestling would the cords be broken, which charmed her spirit back
    from the pure sphere for which it was created.</p>
<p>Millicent was much at Milton Lodge. She dearly loved Mrs. Hartley, and it was
    music to her ear when Colonel Bentley called her his niece, or talked of all she
    was to do for him when he had a right to her services. Yet, notwithstanding
    their constant intercourse, Mrs. Hartley never made the slightest attempt to
    lead her from her delusive rest in this world, to the Sure Repose. She felt
    certain that a deeper and more bitter teaching was awaiting her.</p>
<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7184-072"/>
<p>To Arthur Egerton also, this period was one of wild delight;—he was with
    Millicent constantly, and his heart was full of hope: whatever she might believe
    or think, he knew by the tempest of his own soul, that the power which was now
    at work in the breast of Stephen Aylmer would, assuredly, sooner or later; fling
    her out from thence, as the rock repels the bounding wave that strikes against
    it.</p>
<p>A man must have known the influence of stirring passions before he can rightly
    picture their effect in others.</p>
<p>There are certain matter‐of‐fact persons; such as Mr. Egerton, who, being
    incapable of feeling strongly themselves, are very apt to reason, with
    individuals struggling and suffering as Aylmer was now, much as though they
    stood looking on at a man roasting in a fire, and assured him that he was by no
    means too hot. But Arthur was able to form a perfectly just estimate of<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7184-073"/> Aylmer’s position; and he judged rightly that
    in the whirlwind of feeling in which his soul was now so fiercely contending,
    Millicent Grey would be engulfed and lost.</p>
<p>Arthur had discerned with equal acuteness the real state of Juliet’s feelings
    with regard to Aylmer. But he trusted that vanity and self‐interest would make
    her eager to win him as though she loved him; for she did <emph>not</emph> love
    her cousin’s future husband,—she felt for him, perhaps, as much affection as her
    most selfish nature was capable of, but it was not enough to weigh one second in
    the balance, if her own ease and comfort were staked against it. Her whole
    conduct, from the first bright smile which she bestowed on Aylmer in imitation
    of his pictured ideal, till that moment when in an apparent frenzy of mingled
    shame and despair, she had bounded from his side, had been one splendid piece of
    acting. The motive and secret of her heartless design<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7184-074"/> was simply this:—in Italy her vanity had been piqued
    by hearing of Aylmer as one whom no fascination had yet won from a lofty
    independence, which submitted not to any supremacy of affection. Moved by the
    inordinate vanity and love of admiration which was her ruling passion, she
    determined that she would accomplish this conquest which seemed so unattainable,
    and not only subdue him to herself, but she declared, in a moment of triumph, to
    the Marchesa L—— that she would gain him by the powers of her mind alone!</p>
<p>She had heard of the power which mere beauty could exercise over him, and with
    the perverseness and personal ambition of a true woman, she was resolved that
    without this advantage she would charm him, and break down the strongholds of
    his indifference. In the course of her intercourse with him, which she has
    herself described, she could not but feel a certain admiration for his<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7184-075"/> talents, and a degree of interest in himself which
    supplied the place of the genuine affection her utter egotism rendered her
    incapable of feeling. Further, when she discovered that Aylmer was heir to a
    large fortune, and devotedly fond of Italian life, it struck her that he was the
    very man to suit her as a husband. She was particularly anxious to be married,
    in order to attain that perfect indifference to all trammels which she was quite
    determined, whoever the individual might be, he should allow her,—and she was
    also bent upon being established in Italy, where the admiration she excited was
    quite equal to her wishes, and the whole style of life precisely to her
    taste.</p>
<p>She at once therefore decided that she would marry him; and when, on arriving at
    Rookcliffe, she found that he was the promised husband of her cousin,—this only
    gave to her design, and the subtle mode in which it was to be worked out, the
    additional zest<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7184-076"/> which the pleasure of
    triumphing over a rival is known to produce in such minds as hers.</p>
<p>In truth, there was nothing Juliet so much delighted in as a difficult enterprise
    of this kind, where she had to exercise her intriguing powers, and that capacity
    for acting a part which would have made her an admirable diplomatist, had she
    been a man. As has been seen, she had never for a moment relaxed in her task,
    and now her design was fast ripening to the ultimate triumph.</p>
<p>And this was the being for whom Stephen Aylmer was wildly longing to sacrifice
    the deep mine of true and noble love which Millicent Grey had offered him! It is
    often so seen in the world.</p>
<p>Millicent’s wedding day was also to be that of her coming of age, and it was
    within a fortnight of the period when Juliet returned to Rookcliffe. Aylmer
    himself was to<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7184-077"/> follow in two days, and Arthur
    felt that the hour was now come when he must rouse every faculty, and exert
    every energy to further that consummation, which the secret working of (the so
    called) destiny had so long been preparing. If the course of events did not
    produce, as he firmly believed it would, the separation of Millicent and Aylmer,
    he was sternly resolved to accomplish it by other means. What plan he was to
    adopt could only be decided according to the circumstances; but this at least
    was certain, that the struggle must soon be over,—now was the crisis,—the crisis
    of many lives.</p>
<p>Juliet returned from Richmond, looking sad and depressed, for it was quite
    necessary that Aylmer should hear it remarked that she seemed unhappy when she
    herself arrived. She never mentioned him, however, and Millicent, in her great
    guilelessness, did not for a moment suspect that they had met. Arthur knew it,
    however, by the instinct<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7184-078"/> which enabled him to
    see, in all Aylmer’s actions, the reflection of his own feelings.</p>
<p>On the day when Stephen was expected, Juliet received, as usual, various letters,
    handed to her by her father across the breakfast table. Arthur’s keen eyes
    detected one in Aylmer’s handwriting,—he admired the coolness with which his
    sister slipped it unread into her pocket; and when, later, he saw her again,
    after she had spent an hour alone, he scrutinized her expression eagerly, that
    he might gather from it some clue to the contents of the letter.</p>
<p>He saw that those gleaming eyes were full of triumph, and yet there was a
    restlessness and anxiety in her whole appearance, which seemed to indicate a
    painful suspense;—there was, too, a deepening bitterness in the look of deadly
    hate which she was for ever casting askance on Millicent, which considerably
    alarmed him. Still, he felt within himself a strength to hew down all ob‐<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7184-079"/> stacles, should even fate oppose instead of
    assisting him, and he knew that Juliet resembled him in this and many other
    qualities: he felt certain she was equally determined with himself, and that the
    grasp of these slender white fingers on her victim was firm as the iron grasp of
    a tiger.</p>
<p>Aylmer was to arrive rather late in the evening, so that the whole party were
    assembled in the drawing‐room to receive him.</p>
<p>The Egerton family were certainly rather remarkable than otherwise for their
    obtuseness, but they must have been dense indeed, if each and all had not felt
    that there would be fierce work in the destinies of those gathered round the
    hearth that day, and that the hour now fast approaching, was one which would
    cast its shadow through many lives.</p>
<p>When the sound of the carriage‐wheels announced that he, so deeply loved, so
        madly<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7184-080"/> hated, was at hand, not the coldest.
    heart among them could avoid a throb of agitation. Arthur’s hand closed upon the
    arm of the chair on which he sat, with a grasp of terrible power, whilst with a
    violent effort he strove to appear calm. Juliet clasped her hands on the cushion
    of the sofa, where she had thrown himself, and laid down her head upon them, so
    that her countenance was completely concealed, and Millicent,—Millicent neither
    spoke nor moved, but suddenly, she knew not how or why, her whole soul seemed
    paralyzed with the most agonizing terror,—she could not tell what caused it.
    Five minutes before, she had been serene and hopeful as any on this earth may
    be, and now it was as though despair had come and stood bodily before her, and
    said, “Thou shalt be mine!” Juliet’s look and manner before she thus hid her
    face,—the expression on every countenance to which her startled eyes turned for
    comfort, all seemed<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7184-081"/> to her as though they knew
    of something dreadful about to come upon her, of which she alone was ignorant.
    Meanwhile a slow heavy step was heard without; the servant had opened the
    door,—he stood holding it to admit Stephen Aylmer, but he kept meanwhile looking
    back with surprise into the passage, for the guest lingered long on the
    threshold: at length he could do so no more,—he passed into the room,—the door
    closed, and he stood amongst them silent and motionless. They all felt as though
    one from the dead had appeared before them, so appalling, so strange was his
    aspect; ghastly pale,—rigid,—speechless he remained, as if utterly unconscious
    of where he was, or what he was doing,—no greeting passed his lips,—one thought
    and feeling only appeared to absorb him. His eyes had fastened upon the drooping
    figure that lay there on the sofa, the waving hair trailing to the ground, and
    the convulsive move‐<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7184-082"/> ments telling how the
    heart within was heaving up the aching breast.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Egerton came forward, and welcomed him; he gave his hand
    mechanically,—his lips moved, but he spoke not, nor had he power seemingly to
    avert one moment the strained agonizing look. Some one placed a chair for
    him,—he sat down,—his hands fell powerless by his side, and all the life within
    him seemed gathered into that gaze, fixed as though the object on which he
    looked had turned him to stone. It was a most painful scene, well nigh
    insupportable even to the parties least concerned.</p>
<p>It roused the father of the family himself to action,—he made an effort to
    speak.—“Come, Millicent, you are very slow to welcome our friend on his arrival;
    do you not see he is tired, come and speak to him.”</p>
<p>She rose trembling, and advanced with hesitating steps,—her movement did at
        last<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7184-083"/> cause him to withdraw that fascinated
    look from Juliet,—the expression in his eyes changed as light changes into
    darkness, from the passionate adoration with which they had settled on the
    graceful reclining figure, to one of absolute ungovernable hate, and thus they
    glared on her,—on her, his promised wife. When she moved towards him, he shrank
    within himself, as men shrink with a miserable repugnance from the viper
    creeping to their feet, and the horrible look stopped her short.
    Gasping,—appalled,—breathless, it fixed her to that place,—it held her there
    bound and chained, as it were, to inconceivable torture, like a victim to the
    rack, then slowly the eyes turned away from her, the sunbeam of love passed into
    them again, and they became riveted once more with their intense and mournful
    tenderness upon the form so unutterably beloved.</p>
<p>When their spell was taken from Milli‐<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7184-084"/> cent, she
    was seized with strong shivering from head to foot. Charles saw that she would
    have fallen, and, starting up, he placed her in his own seat; then the painful,
    fearful silence fell upon them all again, and there was a few minutes’ pause,
    During that brief interval interminable ages of misery rolled over the soul of
    the unhappy Millicent. It was enough—enough,—that horrible look had spoken to
    her with the most fearful eloquence; it had recorded all—all, from the very
    beginning—it had told her every detail of the deep love that had risen in the
    heart of Aylmer for Juliet—it had described to her how this love had grown and
    strengthened even to madness, so that it had transformed the very soul of the
    man, and constrained him to hate, even with a deadly hate, the being albeit
    innocent, who stood between him and the object of his worship. No book written
    within and without in fairest characters could<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7184-085"/>
    have told her all this better than his look; and so in the stillness that
    reigned among those persons, all smitten with silence by the presence of
    terrible passions, there went forth the sound of one faint gasp—one low sob from
    the very heart—the knell of a life’s happiness. Then Millicent rose, and
    stumbling forward like one walking in utter darkness, fled from that room. Along
    the passages, out beyond the hall‐door, she rushed, flying madly from the misery
    that was dogging her heels, clinging to her hand, mounting up to take its firm
    seat in her heart.</p>
<p>Out into the dark night, she knew not where,—she fell at the foot of an old oak
    tree; down,—down on her knees, crouching, her face in her hands,—moaning as the
    wind moans at night, deep sobs at intervals rising from the breaking heart,—the
    whole frame shaking as the storm drove through her soul like a reed in the
    tempest.</p>
<p>“Was it come to this! was it come to<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7184-086"/> this!” she
    cried out at times; “Why was she brought into a world where there seemed no
    place for her,—surely it were better for them had she never been born;” then
    down fell the desolate head to the earth, and rested on the cold damp ground.
    But a hand was laid on her shoulder,—a strong arm lifted her up,—a voice
    sounded, trembling with violent emotion, on her ear.</p>
<p>“Millicent, I have long foreseen this hour,—I knew it would come,—it has been
    preparing these many months,—it is the crisis of your destiny; but you must be
    strong, you must arise and act; it will not avail you to lie mourning here.”</p>
<p>She looked up to him through her long disheveled hair with the most beseeching
    childlike gaze.</p>
<p>“Arthur, I am so bewildered,—I am so lost,—I can scarcely tell what has
    happened;—no one spoke to me, and yet my. very soul seemed shattered suddenly.
        No<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7184-087"/> one cursed me, but I came here weeping
    as though they had,—tell me what it all means; am I dreaming?”</p>
<p>“No, there is no dream, but stern, cruel reality. I will tell you all, Millicent,
    I will befriend you in this hour, and he alone can be a friend who tells you
    truth to‐night;—take courage then and hear it.” His voice now swelled out with
    exultation. “It is that Stephen Aylmer loves my sister Juliet as never man, save
    one, has loved before.”</p>
<p>She shrieked out piteously at these words, and writhed as though he had driven a
    knife into her breast.</p>
<p>“Yet more,—it is—that he now hates you for her sake.”</p>
<p>Again the scream, the anguish as of a new made wound.</p>
<p>“Millicent, you will not endure this—you will rise and act; you will not let him
    trample on you?”</p>
<p>“No, never, never!” she exclaimed,<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7184-088"/> springing to
    her feet with flashing eyes; “but is it certain—where is the proof of this?—he
    never told it me—he did love me once.”</p>
<p>All her long tenderness for him came gushing round her heart, so that she could
    not endure to admit the truth. She was like a drowning man, clinging to some
    last frail shred of the breaking rope, who well knows the whelming waters are
    about most surely to sweep him away for ever.</p>
<p>“Do you wish a proof?” said Arthur; “you shall have it. I will bring you a proof
    that would shake the maddest unbelief—a proof in Stephen Aylmer’s own
    handwriting: do you require this?—then you shall see it.” He thought of the
    letter Juliet had that day received.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes!” said Millicent, wildly; “bring me this, and when I have seen it, then
    for ever will I rid him of my presence: never more shall he look on me<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7184-089"/> with hate. He shall be happy, though my life’s misery
    should make him so. Go, bring it me—here will I wait.”</p>
<p>She knelt down again, and laid her head on the root of the tree.</p>
<p>“Not here, Millicent, the night is so dark and cold: it will chill you.”</p>
<p>“Here! I will not—I cannot stir, till I have seen it. Arthur, do not trifle with
    me; remember, there is a life at stake. What darkness is like to the darkness of
    my soul? What chill like to that which lies at my heart? Go.”</p>
<p>He saw she was resolute, and went; he did not for a moment doubt that Juliet
    would readily entrust him with the letter, when she knew for what purpose it was
    intended, nor was he less certain that it would be of a nature to accomplish
    most fully the desired effect upon Millicent, even were it but a despairing
    farewell. The revelation of Aylmer’s hopeless love for Juliet would be<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7184-090"/> enough to raise at once the woman’s pride within her
    in all its indomitable strength.</p>
<p>He found that both Juliet and Aylmer had left the drawing‐room; but when he asked
    for his sister, Anne told him she was in her room alone. He went thither, and
    knocked at the door; Juliet called to him to come in, and he entered, closing
    the door behind him. He had never seen her look more lovely, than as she sat
    there, dressed in flowing white garments, leaning her fair head against the
    high‐backed chair of crimson velvet; her brilliant eyes were full of thought;
    her small white hands wandering restlessly among the long hair that was twining
    round them. Arthur paused for a moment to look on, and to rejoice, with a fierce
    exultation, in her glorious beauty. Therein was his hope: this it was that had
    worked for him so well. Then he advanced to her, and stood before her, fixing
    his freezing gaze on her face. Juliet and Arthur<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7184-091"/> had never directly communicated together on the one subject of all‐absorbing
    interest to them both; yet from the very commencement they had felt that they
    mutually understood one another, and that the wishes of both were to be
    accomplished by the same end. There is a sort of freemasonry between persons who
    are both alike delivered up to the influence of evil passions; and Arthur was
    not more perfectly aware of Juliet’s motives and designs upon Aylmer, than she
    was of the nature and extent of his love for their cousin.</p>
<p>They had throughout felt sure of one another’s assistance in any emergency,
    because both were conscious of their entire community of interests; and they
    knew likewise that there was much similarity of character between them in the
    determined resolution which they had to carry on their own designs, in spite of
    overwhelming obstacles.</p>
<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7184-092"/>
<p>Thus when Arthur came to claim his sister’s aid at a moment so critical to both
    of them, he spoke, and she listened more as if it were the continuation of a
    direct and open intercourse, than the first breaking in upon the meaning silence
    they had hitherto maintained.</p>
<p>It was not a time for delay. Arthur spoke hurriedly; and he saw, by Juliet’s
    kindling eye, that her thoughts flew faster than his words.</p>
<p>“Juliet, the moment for action is come; all is at stake this night: if we are
    prompt and vigorous, the game is ours. Millicent requires but to be convinced,
    beyond the possibility of a doubt, that Aylmer so loves you, as well nigh to
    hate her for your sake, and she abandons him for ever. Yet more, she will, I am
    convinced, promote your marriage by every means in her power.”</p>
<p>A smile of triumph flashed over the beautiful face.</p>
<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7184-093"/>
<p>“But she must have a proof—a certain proof that so it is.”</p>
<p>“Poor fool!” said Juliet, with bitter contempt; “did she not see enough this
    night? Is she not convinced, when his own conduct showed him almost bereft of
    reason for very anguish?”</p>
<p>“Her heart is convinced, but she had ever given a faith strong as that of a
    trusting child to his own assurance, and her cry of imploring despair is ringing
    yet in my ears when she repeated that he had said no word to her, and for this
    reason she must have some proof that indeed his love was for ever gone from her.
    Juliet, such a proof you have! You received a letter from him to‐day. Is it of a
    nature to convince her, beyond the questioning of hope’s last lingering effort,
    that he has deserted her in soul most truly and most utterly?”</p>
<p>Juliet’s only answer was to laugh out exultingly.</p>
<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7184-094"/>
<p>“Trust me with it, then, for this one night, and the deed is done. He is
    yours.”</p>
<p>She looked at him steadily for a few minutes; then rose, took the letter from her
    desk, and placed it in his hands.</p>
<p>“I trust you with it,” she said, “because it is for your own life you are
    working.” These words contained the ruling principle of Juliet Egerton’s
    existence; she believed in nothing but that great god, self, which is so
    worshipped in this world of ours. It was the deity of her own soul, governing
    her every action, and her faith was, that he reigned in like manner, singly and
    alone, in the spirits of all flesh. This belief guided her whole conduct to her
    fellow creatures.<corr/></p>
<p>But Arthur had his treasure, and it mattered little to him for what reason she
    gave it. He fled down the stairs—he passed out into the dark night again. Far
    off beneath the old tree he could see the faint glimmering of the white garments
    of her<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7184-095"/> who lay there waiting his coming as men
    wait their executioner. He held in his hand the death‐warrant of her whole
    life’s happiness; and had he no remorse, self‐elected murderer as he was, had he
    no thought but for his own selfish love? his own soul’s satisfaction? had he no
    horror of the crime he was about to commit? by the will of heaven, the one
    solitary and adored hope had been killed within her heart, then for her needful
    chastening, doubtless, was it done; but who appointed him to be its slayer? Oh!
    at the last hour many that have walked through the world with smiling faces and
    stainless hands, shall come out convicted as murderers of deepest dye!—each
    one—each one who has ever destroyed the happiness of another!—and are the sea
    sands more innumerable?</p>
<p>Had the dark earthly passion that twined, even as a clinging serpent, round his
    soul, so enveloped that immortal being in<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7184-096"/> its
    deadly coils, that he could be no longer sensible of those holier influences
    that fail not, in every time of strong temptation, to come as a merciful waning
    in some one shape or other?</p>
<p>Hark! even now that voice from heaven speaks, which, though varied its tone,
    disguised its sweetness often, yet never is silent in those tremendous hours,
    when angel and demon struggle for the deathless human spirit.</p>
<p>Arthur stood one moment only on the threshold of his home, that he might still
    the strong beating of his heart, ere he fled onwards to use on the writhing soul
    of her loved the instrument of torture he would have purchased with his life’s
    blood; and in that moment, borne towards him by the obedient wind,
    floating—floating to his charmed ear, there came the ringing music of the sweet
    church chimes, that, night by<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7184-097"/> night thus told
    the expectant world that Christmas‐tide drew near.</p>
<p>Sweet and clear, chiming gladly, softly, through the thrilling air, they came
    like faint and far‐off echoes of the harmony celestial that was heard in that
    Glorious Night of Wonder, when angel voices, loud exulting, filled the high arch
    of heaven with melody, unheard before or since.</p>
<p>Those sounds—those sounds sweeping from heaven on his heart, they bore him back
    long years to his infant days of deep belief, when in the child’s pure mind the
    Light Divine reigned bright and glorious, shedding a lustre over earth and
    heaven, and making glad the tomb which he was taught to know was Eden’s
    gate.</p>
<p>All, all was darkness now—earthly ambition, evil passions, love idolatrous, like
    foul mists, had arisen to spread in blackness through his spirit, and chase away
    the beams from the eternal sun; but still the<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7184-098"/>
    memory of his early faith and innocence,—that, with the whispering music
    came,—reflected, as it were, a shadowy gleam upon his present crime, till he was
    staggered at the sight of it.</p>
<p>He passed his shaking hand across his forehead,—one moment he must pause, before
    he went to consummate that fellow‐creature’s destiny, to seal it with the seal
    of deep despair.</p>
<p>He stayed the feet that swiftly would have flown towards her, and turned another
    way; he plunged down into the thick plantation, where the wind was only sporting
    wildly with the dead leaves and the withered flowers, and the angel and the
    demon went by his side, as he ran on frantically through the deep mazes of the
    wood; and it was as though both spoke to him with urgent warning and entreaty,
    the angel, in accents sweeter than ever to our ears the voice we love the best
    on earth,<pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7184-099"/> beseeching him to abandon his cruel
    and murderous project, and rather, with a noble self‐sacrifice, such as wakes
    rejoicing in the realms which were his own bright home, endearour even yet to
    rescue her from the gulf of misery into which she was falling—falling fast. If
    by the will of heaven who was appointed to suffer all the mortal anguish he was
    preparing for her now, then assuredly no power could save; but let not the deed
    be his—let not her chastening be his crime: let him rather, tearing from his own
    breast the cherished hope, go back to Stephen Aylmer, and tell him what she was,
    for whom he deserted thus his chosen bride, and what the depth of agony that
    curdled in the true heart he was breaking. It might not be too late—Arthur might
    save her yet, or, if not, at least it were a righteous effort. This was the
    angers pleading; but the demon’s subtle whispering kept breathing venom
        through<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7184-100"/> his heart, telling him to beware of
    such a course, for haply he might succeed, and then would she escape him, when
    even in his grasp. Then would he see her happy by his rival’s side—then would he
    see her go forth into life the joyous wife, casting back not a look on him,
    desolate on earth, with but the one most gnawing deep regret for this night’s
    mad forbearance. Yes, if even when cast out from Aylmer’s heart, she yet should
    never turn to him, so were it better to see her pining solitary in the world,
    than know her happy in her husband’s love, forgetting him for ever.</p>
<p>Distracted by these contending thoughts, he stood—hearing on the one side the
    ringing chimes so sweet and solemn, and on the other the shrieking of the
    mournful blast, whose withering melancholy fills us with such a horror of
    suffering. Irresolute he stood; the courage failed him to accept the sublime and
    noble office offered to him now,<pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7184-101"/> and to pass
    from the stormy world of human passions and human hopes and fears, into the
    serene and breathless region, pure and still, and cold as a land deep buried
    beneath unstained snow, where the martyred in soul may dwell on earth. He had
    not strength for this: too wily were the demon’s dark suggestions, and yet his
    very soul was stirred within him by the sweet pleading of the voice celestial.
    Not long, however, will the holy powers thus struggle with the spirit that
    resists them. A certain space is allotted to the messengers divine, and if the
    pure impulse be not followed up in hours like these, when good and evil demand a
    choice between them, as the time of grace expires the angel‐wings are spread,
    and upward soar again, whilst back the feeble loitering soul must fall into the
    fiendish grasp.</p>
<p>It was so with Arthur Egerton to‐night. Too long he lingered, doubting,
        shrinking<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7184-102"/> alike from the cross and from
    the crime, so the moment of mercy came in vain.</p>
<p>Suddenly the sweet chimes died upon the still soft air; they had spoken their
    mission to the world, and were hushed again, and with them, like a vision,
    passed the memory of childhood’s holy faith, and the purity of childhood’s
    radiant hope in paradise. Only the man’s deep love was raging through his
    heart—the man’s fierce jealousy and earth‐bound wishes; no sound came to him
    now, save the howling blast that ever seems like the great voice of the world
    lamenting for its universal woe, and borne with it he fancied he could hear the
    cry of Millicent, beseeching him to hasten to her.</p>
<p>Oh! wherefore was he lingering here, letting slip the hour when it was given him
    to accomplish that for which he had been so madly longing these many months? He
    had no thought for heaven, nor hope within it, and earth had but one good, and
        that<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7184-103"/> was in his hands to‐night, if llke a
    madman he flung it not away.</p>
<p>Back, back through the tangled wood he flew, no longer undecided, resolute in
    will, and the demon hurried with him; but the angel spread his snow‐white wings,
    and soaring up through the soft dark air, took his course heavenward. Again
    would he visit, perhaps, the wayward soul; but fainter—fainter ever would his
    voice be, while bolder and more daring should the demon‐whisper sound.</p>
<p>Millicent lay where he left her; it might be she had really called him, for her
    suspense was intolerable. She started up as he came near; she flung back the
    dripping hair, soaked with the night‐dew, from her pale sad countenance—she
    fixed on him eyes that were strangely bright and clear; that strength and energy
    were within her now which ever come to us at the crisis of our fate, however
    feeble we may feel in its anticipation.</p>
<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7184-104"/>
<p>“Have you brought it?” she said: her voice was strained and unnatural, but
    perfectly calm.</p>
<p>“I have it—it is here, in this letter.”</p>
<p>“Give it me.”</p>
<p>“You cannot read it thus in the darkness.”</p>
<p>“There is a light—let us go to it;” she pointed to the lamp which hung in the
    porch at Rookcliffe. He walked towards it, and she followed; he heard her light
    footsteps, her quick half‐suffocated breathing—yes, she followed him—his heart
    swelled with a fierce exultation. Already was the charm at work—he was drawing
    her after him by the power of her despair.</p>
<p>They came and stood within the old stone porch; the light fell strongly around
    them. Without a word, Millicent took the letter from Arthur’s hands, and,
    standing upright, proceeded to read it through. He had meant to have said so
    much to her<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7184-105"/> before she read it—to have
    prepared her to find in his breast the love she had lost a hundred‐fold more
    earnest and devoted; but he dared not speak to her. So rigid in her determined
    calm, she seemed to him no longer the same being now—the playful, humble, loving
    Millicent; rather was she like some dauntless warrior, standing forth in the
    front ranks of the battle to meet the cannon’s wrath. She read it all—each word
    of deep unutterable tenderness from her promised husband to her cousin
    Juliet,—she read that whilst he still must cling to honour and his plighted
    word,—his longing—nay, his prayer would be, to die upon the very altar‐steps,
    when once his promise was fulfilled to the bride no longer loved.</p>
<p>So she finished it, and flung it from her. Arthur saw that all the woman was in
    those eyes again, as she raised them with passionate imploring agony to
        heaven,—in<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7184-106"/> those white quivering lips,—in
    those shaking hands pressed mournfully on the desolate breast, which no one ever
    more should shield from the chilling blasts of destiny. His own affection for
    her rose almost to madness at the sight,—now was his time, now would he comfort
    her with the intensity of his most undivided love.</p>
<p>“Millicent, Millicent!”—he bent himself before her in an agony of
    supplication,—“other love than his awaits you, deeper, deeper than the soul of
    man hath yet conceived till now.”</p>
<p>His words were too wild, too incoherent for a record here, but he told her all,
    all he had felt and suffered for her sake,—he poured out his whole feeling heart
    before her, and then he waited her answer, as one sinking with the roar of many
    waters in his ears, awaits the voice responding to his cry for help.</p>
<p>She seemed to have heard him speak;<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7184-107"/> at least
    when he ceased, she lowered the wild gaze from heaven, and looked upon him. With
    a startled fearful glance she looked, then letting both her cold hands fall upon
    his drooping head, she said, “I thank you,—I thank you,”—(each time with
    increasing vehemence)—“I thank you that you have saved me from being unto him a
    curse!”</p>
<p>With that she turned and fled. He saw her bound through the open door into the
    hall,—he heard her echoing steps along the passages in frantic haste, and she
    was gone. And was this all?—was it thus she had received the offering of his
    whole soul,—the full avowal of his unchanging, unreserved, unbounded love?—with
    but that wild and fearful blessing, that he had saved her from inflicting pain
    on that other, not more unworthy than beloved! For a moment his heart sickened
    within him,—then he saw and understood, that truly her soul<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7184-108"/> was so absorbed by the one thought, the one despair,
    that no offer idea could have access there.</p>
<p>It mattered not, his time was coming. For ever broken were the links that bound
    her,—a shattered lonely tree, by lightning struck, she seemed. None would come
    near to tend and lift her up, save him alone. Surely his grasp was upon her! Who
    but death should make him quit his hold?</p>

<head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p>SHE was alone now. She bolted and barred her door,—she opened wide the window to
    admit the cold wind upon that fevered brain. There was luxury in this,—she was
    alone; no witness there,—visible to human eyes at least,—one hour’s indulgence,
    or her heart would burst. She laid herself down upon the floor,—she buried her
    face in those convulsed hands.</p>
<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7184-110"/>
<p>She shook and shivered as the storm of grief raged over her.</p>
<p>Many a grave has been dug with tears such as those she shed that night!
    sobbing—sobbing, heart‐broken, she lay prostrate. Often when the full sense of
    her misery came upon her the sob rose to a shriek; then died away into that low
    dreary moaning which has no words, but is the deep voice of the soul most
    eloquent in its unutterable suffering. So passed the first moments of this—her
    new existence—the life without hope.</p>
<p>Millicent! said we not well when at the vessel’s side you stood and looked
    exultingly on the boundless sea that swift was bearing you to the threshold of
    the world you so pined to know—said we not well that could you have foreseen
    this hour, you would have prayed the whelming waves to take you in their
    terrible embrace, and hide you in their chilly depths less cruel and cold than
    human breast?</p>
<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7184-111"/>
<p>At length for very exhaustion the tempest within her was assuaged: it was a
    relief to exchange the first gnawing anguish for the settled stillness of
    despair. Now when the free indulgence of her grief had done its work, she would
    think what measures must be taken in this her life’s emergency; so she rose up
    staggering, giddy with sorrow. Never more should her step go light and free on
    earth: she was aged with the centuries of wretchedness gone over her.</p>
<p>She plunged her head and hands in cooling water: she must have all her intellect
    and strength of reason now. Back must roll the tide of tortured feeling from her
    soul, whilst she stood forth with clear collected thoughts to resolve and act as
    beseemed the being he once had loved and chosen. A lifetime would be long enough
    to weep hereafter.</p>
<p>So she was very calm as she took her seat and resolutely looked her destiny in
        the<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7184-112"/> face; it had a hideous aspect, but she
    quailed not now, for she was not alone in this matter,—<emph>his</emph> fate was
    like her own, involved. Most women have a martyr’s heart within them, often no
    great convulsion in their life calls it forth, as now it was aroused in
    Millicent; and then it does but expend itself on a thousand little daily
    sacrifices and secret endurances for the friends they love, most often by them
    unnoticed even. But when, like hers, their soul has been appointed to the storm
    and whirlwind, then is it ready, with all its noble courage and its dauntless
    suffering.</p>
<p>She looked, then, into her destiny in its new form, and this was what she
    saw:—For herself, it was plain that all was darkness now,—above, around. She
    never yet had had eyes for the light of heaven, and that of earth was gone. The
    sunbeams of hope and love had fled, and the night had come. His love had made
    the world<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7184-113"/> where she had dwelt, bright and
    glorious as some enchanted sphere, but suddenly the earth on which she stood had
    passed away, as it were, from beneath her feet,—a strong convulsion had rent the
    ground asunder, the firm ground where she had hoped to walk so happy by his
    side. It had parted in a yawning chasm, and she had fallen into the terrible
    abyss, thrown down into darkness and despair.</p>
<p>He had driven her out from his sheltering arms, lonely to shiver in a wilderness,
    now bleak and cold. It needed not many words to describe her fate, now she was
    desolate,—desolate.</p>
<p>But in this shattered life did any good remain? In this most thick darkness was
    there a ray at least of light reflected? Yes, existence had yet one good within
    its limit, and through the deep gloom one beam yet strayed,—far off from her,
    and powerless to warm her poor, chilled heart, as the fair<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7184-114"/> star that shines, unconscious of our being, in the
    distant heavens; but still, because the last remaining treasure earth could
    have, she must devote herself unto it, as we are devoted to our life‐hope, be it
    what it may. It was his happiness,—this sole capacity for enjoyment life still
    offered her,—to know him happy, any how, by any means, even in another’s
    love.</p>
<p>That was the one, pale flower that only had not withered, when this night made
    such fierce havoc, in the blooming Eden of her past existence: all the sweet
    blossoms that were wont to spring around her feet had perished when her sun of
    hope went down; and this alone remained to be the object of her care, and deep
    solicitude,—the last light to live for in the darkness of that desert; so that
    her existence was now gathered up into this one thing,—the wish, and, as a
    necessary result, the active effort, for his happiness.</p>
<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7184-115"/>
<p>It was evident that much depended upon herself now—no other, in fact, could
    promote his union with Juliet Egerton. Therefore bending the strong powers of
    her soul to this one object, in that hour of calm and dear reflection she saw
    distinctly, as in a plan rolled out before her, how it was to be done, and his
    great prosperity, her complete adversity, accomplished.</p>
<p>She must do all—she must release him from his engagement, she must gain from him
    the promise that Juliet should be his wife; lest shame or remorse should deter
    him, she must obtain Colonel Bentley’s difficult consent; and, further, she
    must, out of her own fortune, provide Juliet with such a portion, as should
    enable them to marry without waiting for Aylmer’s inheritance, for she knew that
    Mr. Egerton had lived too magnificently in early life, to be able now to provide
    for his numerous family.</p>
<p>But further—and this was the fiercest<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7184-116"/> effort in
    all that task of unutterable bitterness—she must perform the whole in such a
    manner as that he should believe it cost her nothing. Her life would become one
    long remorse, if, in this its crisis, she so weakly acted, as to let one shadow
    from her own despair, obscure the faintest ray of his long‐interrupted sunshine.
    This were, in truth, to be most faithless to her mission rather, if possible,
    she must so accomplish it, as that he should believe she loved him no more.</p>
<p>So be it; she was ready. She had given, and entirely devoted, her life to his
    happiness; and if he chose that, not by the love and tenderness of this life,
    but by its utter sacrifice and misery, the work should be performed—she was
    content to serve him according to his own desire.</p>
<p>One thing only she deeply felt was needful for herself—the whole must be<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7184-117"/> accomplished quickly—the strength that was
    within her would not long abide. She was resolute—she had nerved herself to the
    torture—she had set before her, his good, as the one thing to be effected, and
    with serene, untroubled aspect she <emph>must</emph> effect it, by the calm
    surrender of her soul to an anguish that hath no name in words. But the power to
    do this thing could be found surely for a brief space only! Quickly, quickly,
    she would do it all, never stopping to breathe—to gasp—working, working on, till
    he stood firm and secure, in full possession of his heart’s desire; then, when
    it was done, she would go forth from this place of torture to some far distant
    spot, where she might lay down her head, and close her eyes, because life would
    be over—all, save the painful sensation of existence.</p>
<p>Millicent did not appear at breakfast next morning, but shortly after she sent<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7184-118"/> a message requesting that Aylmer would meet
    her alone in the library.</p>
<p>The mind of this unhappy man was now in a state of utter chaos; his affection for
    Juliet, on which she had worked during their absence with a fearful power, was
    now perfectly ungovernable, and yet he clung to honour, so long his ruling
    principle, with a frantic tenacity. To desert Millicent, or to let her come as a
    barrier between himself and Juliet, seemed alike impossible—everywhere
    insupportable misery appeared to be before him. The scene of his arrival at
    Rookcliffe showed that his reason was well nigh sinking in the struggle.</p>
<p>He knew by the quick instinct of feeling that this message from Millicent Grey
    boded a crisis; for with his dark night‐thoughts, since last he saw her, had
    come the consciousness that he had looked on her with hate, and that she had
    read that hatred in his eyes.</p>
<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7184-119"/>
<p>He sat in the library shaking in every limb, when the door opened, and closed
    again upon her, from whom he had won a life, with the promise of a love until
    death.</p>
<p>She came forward slowly, with that mournful dignity which invests most often the
    years of widowhood. She had prepared herself for this hour of unflinching
    endurance: with what torture, may none who read this page ever know! She had
    studied most deeply the part she had to play; she had composed her features,
    settled her aspect as we straighten the limbs of a corpse,—and truly her face
    now was very like, in its deep stillness, to the face of the dead. White it was,
    and rigid as theirs, fixed in the same indomitable calm; for even as they feel
    no more, so had she killed, within herself, the power of feeling, till this task
    should be accomplished. In her breast, however, the viper only slept: soon would
    it rise to sting her to the heart<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7184-120"/> with
    redoubled vigour—but in theirs it should have no venom. She had laid her strong
    resolution, as it were, like a great stone on the fountain of her tears,—and
    there was not one now in those eyes,—although not more wildly, darkly mournful
    is the wintry heaven, than they were, with their deep sad gaze. She had smoothed
    the long hair on the tranquil dead‐white forehead, and composed each fold of her
    fair garments, that in her outward appearance there should be no indication of
    the feverish restless agony within. Meekly were the pale hands folded on her
    breast,—so very calm, they seemed not truly to be laid upon a raging world of
    misery. And thus she came and stood before him, a strange contrast to himself
    indeed, for he trembled and was feeble, as though some mysterious power had
    smitten the strong man, and taken away his strength.</p>
<p>They seemed to have reversed their parts,<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7184-121"/> —the
    task she was performing should rather have been his to accomplish,—the weakness
    he was showing, none would have blamed in the timid woman.</p>
<p>But hers had been a noble love, and therefore she was ennobled;—his was a
    cowardly affection, a base usurper in his heart, and so he was a coward now. It
    is seldom that a man can read the depths of a woman’s heart. Aylmer misjudged
    her now, as many like herself are misjudged.</p>
<p>He believed her to be as calm, as indifferent as her outward aspect denoted, only
    he wondered to see her look so pale.</p>
<p>She sat down opposite to him: he guessed not that she did so because her knees
    shook under her, so that she could not stand. Then the white lips parted, and
    she began to speak. Her plan was to conduct this matter as though she were
    herself the aggressor, in order by so doing to save him from the faintest shadow
    of remorse or regret on her<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7184-122"/> account. She would
    further assure his immediate union with Juliet, by speaking as though she
    herself desired to see her cousin taken to be a substitute in her place, because
    she was conscious of her own defection, in abandoning her post as guardian of
    his happiness.</p>
<p>One who had learnt what poor Millicent Grey was never taught,—that all earthly
    feeling, though it were the most devoted and most pure, must give way, even in
    circumstances the most fearful, before the one unflinching principle of right,
    would have felt that not even the unparalleled generosity which prompted this
    course of proceeding, could justify the dissimulation with which it must be
    accomplished.</p>
<p>But her soul was blinded, because it had been unlawfully delivered up to the
    human adoration. There can be no pure worship except it be offered to the Alone
    Good. She knew that in utter singleness of desire her<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7184-123"/> sole object now, was Aylmer’s happiness, and she
    believed that through any means she must perform her vocation by securing it,
    She spoke,—the womanly pride which no suffering, no humiliation can ever
    eradicate, gave firmness to her voice.</p>
<p>“Aylmer, I have come here this day, in order to make to you one prayer,—one
    earnest request, which, although it involves the question of both our lives, I
    yet would say in as few words as possible, both for your own sake and mine.
    Stephen, we have both been mistaken,—you are as fully aware of it, I feel sure,
    as I am myself. There is no prospect of happiness for us in the union where we
    thought to find it. I have come to ask that you will give me back my
    promise,—that you will release me from my engagement.”</p>
<p>Thus, while speaking no word that was not true in the actual matter of it, she
    conveyed the idea that, for her own sake, she would be free. He made no answer,
    for in<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7184-124"/> truth he dared not speak, lest the wild
    rapture that rushed through his soul, as he heard the first signal of release,
    should burst forth into some outward expression of unseemly joy; but her quick
    glance caught the sudden light that flashed in his eyes, and it caused her heart
    to throb with such violence, that she was breathless from the intensity of pain.
    Soon, however, she went on: this interview must be short, or it would kill
    her.</p>
<p>“I know that in withdrawing from you my promise to be your life’s companion, I am
    abandoning my post, and renouncing the charge I had taken upon me, of watching
    over your happiness day by day, and hour by hour; and, therefore, you will not
    think me over bold, if I speak to you now as a privileged friend,—if I confess
    to you, Stephen, that I shall know no peace till another more fitted, more
    worthy of your love” (her voice faltered in spite of her‐<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7184-125"/> self,) “till one who may be to you far more than I
    could ever be, has taken my place, and received your existence into her safe
    keeping,—you know who I mean,—so beautiful,—so beloved,—she seems destined for
    you, who are worthy of the best and fairest. Stephen, be generous; give me the
    comfort of knowing that Juliet is to be your wife; that you are as happy with
    her as—as I would have tried to make you, and then I will go hence in peace, and
    you shall never be disturbed with even the sight of me.”</p>
<p>He was now so astonished, that for a moment he forgot even Juliet and the bright
    prospect opening before him, whilst he asked himself if it were possible that
    Millicent had never really loved him. He could not conceive the possibility of
    such generosity, as she was in real fact displaying, and the man’s vanity was
    actually piqued. Juliet had of late striven earnestly to convince him, that
    Millicent was by no means in‐<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7184-126"/> different to
    Arthur, whose affection for her was evident to all, and she had done this none
    the less eloquently, that she well knew how absolutely false it was. Aylmer
    remembering the past, could not believe it; but now it seemed to him as though
    it must certainly be as that lying voice had said. He felt it would be the most
    intense relief, could he know that it was so indeed; and, speaking for the first
    time, he said eagerly:—</p>
<p>“Millicent, one thing you will admit I have a right to know, even in this
    hour,—Have you, indeed, never loved me?—or rather,—let us not touch the past, it
    is sacred,”—there was some emotion in his tone, as he thought on the days when
    her deep tenderness was displayed so brightly to his eyes that he might as well
    have doubted the clear light of heaven,—“but tell me that which affects the
    present and the future,—do you love me no longer?”</p>
<p>What a question! It had been less<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7184-127"/> bitter for
    her to die, than to give him the assurance for which she saw that he was
    craving, as men crave for the life itself, when they have been near unto death.
    Yes, to know that she loved him no longer would be to him, the perfect happiness
    she so longed to procure him,—here was then the moment, when she was to
    accomplish his peace and joy, with her entire devotion; the sacrifice of her
    whole life was gathered up into the sentence she was next to utter. It
        <emph>must</emph> be the assurance he demanded; but how, even if she risked
    the falsehood, could her lips pronounce it, when the very heart within her was
    swelling, dying with the excess of its intense love for him? But she would not
    fail, she who had done so much for him, in this, the last momentous hour! She
    nerved herself to one tremendous effort,—this was her answer: he had said, “Do
    you love me no longer?” and she replied:</p>
<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7184-128"/>
<p>“<emph>Juliet does</emph>.”</p>
<p>It was quite enough; he never doubted but that, unwilling to pronounce the actual
    confession that she had in heart deserted him, Millicent by this means sought to
    convey to him not only the assurance that in truth she did love him no more, but
    that Juliet had given him all that affection which she had taken away. What
    words could express the boundless joy that came to him with this conviction!—he
    could no longer restrain his passionate delight,—and why should he in truth? He
    believed that Millicent was as thankful as himself to be released!</p>
<p>All embarrassment, all gloom, all fear, passed away from his countenance. He rose
    up radiant with happiness; as if a new life were in him.</p>
<p>“Then,” he exclaimed, “if so it is, if you love me no more—and Juliet does with
    all the tenderness, I doubt not, of her impassioned, generous nature—then,<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7184-129"/> indeed, do I thank you for thus frankly
    putting an end to all idea of the union, which would have made us both so
    wretched. Yes, Millicent, and if your kind heart would seek the assurance of my
    happiness before you can enjoy that which you will so much better secure to
    yourself without me, I can give it to you most fully—for I shall, indeed, find
    it abundantly in her love. If she has given me her affection, I know well how
    deep, how true, how fervent it will be. Kind friend as you are, thus to care for
    my welfare, you may safely trust it in sweet Juliet’s keeping. I know what a
    depth of tenderness is in her soul, and she will watch and tend the life of him
    she loves, as none, I believe, on earth could do.”</p>
<p>In what inquisition had he learned to be such a torturer? It was most awful to
    her to see how well she had performed her work. Alas! alas! to think that he<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7184-130"/> should dream that Juliet’s love and Juliet’s
    care, could ever be what hers had been and was even now! It was a terrible thing
    to see the joy with which he at once assumed that she loved him not, who, for
    his sake, could no longer endure existence. It was impossible for her to
    continue this insupportable scene: she rose up, confused and faint with the
    dreary bewilderment of her soul. The blinding tears were rushing to her eyes,
    her voice was choked, her words most incoherent.</p>
<p>“Then there is no need to say more—it is all fixed, all settled. I think we have
    arranged everything—I mean for the future—for your life—for mine. Oh, what am I
    saying!”</p>
<p>He did not so much as see her agitation, he was so mad with joy.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is all settled! Think no more of it, Millicent—have no remorse, no
        fear!<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7184-131"/> All is well—most well, indeed! I
    will go to Juliet!”</p>
<p>It was Juliet—Juliet ever with him now; her image absorbed all other
    thoughts.</p>
<p>Weary, faint, bowed to the very ground, Millicent crept to the door; it seemed to
    her that now it was not required of her to live any longer. Then she remembered
    that her task was not done yet, not nearly done. She turned round to him again:
    her tones were now very low and faltering.</p>
<p>“Stephen, I have one more favour to ask! It seems to me that you may meet with
    many difficulties—that there will be much opposition to your marriage with
    Juliet. I think that I could remove them all if you will let me, if you will
    have no scruple. It will be happiness, yes, happiness, to promote yours. Juliet
    has no fortune: my uncle and aunt, and Colonel Bentley, might object; do not
        undertake<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7184-132"/> any unpleasant discussions with
    them yourself, let me arrange it all.”</p>
<p>He hardly understood that she meant to carry her generosity even to the extent of
    providing Juliet with a portion, but her words reminded him that, in truth, it
    would be no easy matter to satisfy the various parties concerned in this change,
    and that most certainly none but Millicent herself could effect it.</p>
<p>He felt, therefore, deeply grateful to her for thus completing his happiness for
    him, even whilst he was confident that she did so in expiation of her own
    faithlessness.</p>
<p>“You are right, Millicent; there will, indeed, be difficulties which no one but
    yourself can overcome. You only can bring matters to a happy conclusion; and I
    do gladly and gratefully trust all to you. Blessings on you for the
    thought!”</p>
<p>That blessing broke her heart: she could endure no more, but rushed from him.<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7184-133"/> It seemed the last effort of her strength,
    and, unable to advance, she leant against the wall in the passage, and gasped
    out, faintly:—</p>
<p>“Oh, death! oh, death! come quickly! Be merciful—come quick, and take me!”</p>
<p>Perhaps death would have been, indeed, more merciful than he whose selfish love
    now exulted over her final despair. Arthur, ever at hand, took her gently in his
    arms, and carried her to the next room, where he placed her on a sofa, near the
    open window; the cold air revived her at once, for she had not fainted.</p>
<p>She tried vainly with her pale, quivering lips to thank him, but her beseeching
    eyes told him she would be alone; he bent down, and kissed one of the folds of
    her dress, and then left the room. When he was gone she turned away from the
    light, and hid her face, with one long, deep sigh.</p>

<head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p><hi>MILLICENT GREY</hi> did not rest long; repose in truth, there could never
    more be for her, under the same roof with Stephen Aylmer. Her whole longing now
    was to escape from that place, to fly and hide herself in some far distant spot,
    where she should never see the face, or hear the voice of any one of those who
    had been with her in her days of joy, for ever gone. Her resolution with regard
    to her own fate, had been fully taken, so soon as she decided upon aban‐<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7184-135"/> doning Aylmer. She would return without delay
    to Aix to poor John Forde, who had of late more than once written, expressing a
    wish to see her, and with whose mournful devotion to the dead,—whose passionate
    love for the mouldering ashes, she felt she now could deeply sympathize. In a
    few days she would be of age, and at liberty to leave England. She determined to
    take her departure on the very day that was to have seen her the wife of
    Juliet’s future husband. Alas! her vows of life‐long faithfulness and tender
    love were taken long ago, and she repeated them even yet in the deep of her
    heart, for she was learning now that sad mysterious truth, that an affection
    such as hers can feed even upon despair.</p>
<p>For the few intervening days she would go to Milton Lodge: to sleep another night
    at Rookcliffe was most utterly impossible. To be the witness of their happy
        love,<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7184-136"/> would be to make the bitterness of
    her own miserable desolation beyond the power of human strength to bear.</p>
<p>In truth, she dared not trust herself so much as to look upon his face again; she
    trembled at the wild longing that rose in her breast,—to fly back to him even
    then, to pour out the depths of her soul to him,—to tell him that none, none
    upon this earth could ever love him as she did,—that although she never saw him
    more, he must for ever be to her, the all of life, and hope, and joy. Yes, she
    panted to tell him this, at the very moment, no doubt, when he stood by the side
    of Juliet, and rejoiced with her in evident rapture, that he was free from a
    detested bondage.</p>
<p>Oh! how this thought stung her to the quick; it roused her into action! She must
    up and complete the work that yet remained; she must toil on, on, unceasing,
    till her task was accomplished; she felt<pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7184-137"/> as
    though a strong power was goading her to that labour, till his entire happiness
    was secured, and not a thorn lay in his path.</p>
<p>She rose, and went at once to Mr. and Mrs. Egerton; her task with them was very
    easy. They were fully prepared for her coming,—the scene of last night, her
    interview with Aylmer, and now the fact of which they were aware, that he was
    sitting at Juliet’s side, as her future husband, sufficiently explained the
    nature of Millicent’s mission. They had arranged their tactics with great
    ability. They said they had long perceived that Millicent and Aylmer were
        <emph>mutually</emph> indifferent to one another—indeed, as it was purely a
        <foreign xml:lang="fre">marriage de convenance</foreign>, arranged by
    Colonel Bentley, it could scarcely be otherwise; and it was perfectly natural
    that when Juliet and Aylmer met, who were so well suited to one another, they
    should have formed an attachment. There was a certain indefinable feeling<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7184-138"/> which prevented either of them from glancing
    at Millicent whilst they spoke all these cold, calculating speeches: had they
    looked on that wan face, they would have ceased for very pity.</p>
<p>Mr. Egerton could not help wincing a little when he found that she designed to
    give Juliet a positive fortune: she implored of him so earnestly to allow her
    what she said was her great happiness, and he was in truth so much embarrassed
    how to provide for his daughter, that at last, with a patronizing delight, he
    consented, assuring Millicent he only did so, because she said he could not
    refuse to let her make a wedding present to her cousin.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Egerton found the whole of their niece’s communication extremely
    pleasant, but that which put the climax to their satisfaction was her declaring
    it to be her intention to return for some time to Aix. This would so effectually
    prevent all<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7184-139"/> embarrassment and awkwardness that
    they could not resist letting her see how highly they approved of her plan, and
    equally of her more immediate arrangement, in leaving Rookcliffe for Milton
    Lodge. They had been thinking with much horror of the unmanageable Colonel
    Bentley, and were inexpressibly relieved to find him taken off their hands, and
    to receive Millicent’s assurance, that she would obtain his consent to Aylmer’s
    marriage with Juliet.</p>
<p>At her niece’s request Mrs. Egerton at once ordered the carriage to convey her to
    Milton Lodge, and promised to come with her daughters to take leave of her
    before she left England. They did not fail to assure her of their earnest desire
    that she should soon return to live with them, but their words seemed to fall
    utterly meaningless on her ear, for she was struggling with her own failing
    strength, to gain courage, thus to quit the place where the<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7184-140"/> summer time of her life had passed with its
    redeemless brightness.</p>
<p>Two hours had not elapsed from the time when she passed, in all her agony, from
    Aylmer’s sight, before she crossed the threshold of Rookcliffe for ever. She
    heard the murmur of his voice as she passed the studio, and shivered with the
    strong spasm that grasped her heart at the sound; but her attention was almost
    instantly claimed by Arthur, who stood in the hall, still triumphant, though, in
    spite of himself, almost terrified at what he had done.</p>
<p>He could not remain unmoved when he felt that he himself had been the means of
    driving her from her home, and casting her out for ever from the only happiness
    she had ever known. He had not expected this abrupt departure, and it alarmed
    him for his own future plans. He seized her hand, and exclaimed,</p>
<p>“Oh, Millicent, what is it you mean to do? where are you going?”</p>
<pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7184-141"/>
<p>She turned round to him with a wild, unnatural look in her eyes, whilst a strange
    smile passed over her lips.</p>
<p>“Where am I going? Drifting down with the current, Arthur,—the current that flows
    to the deep, deep sea, where the dead have gone to their rest. Who can arrange
    his own destiny, or tell what it shall be? Do you not know we are all at the
    mercy of the waves on that fierce stream of life: for some, it has smooth
    waters, and they go safely down; but there are others whom the stormy billows
    seize and dash against the rocks, and there they perish, Arthur.” She flung back
    his hand as she spoke, and sprung into the carriage, leaving him with the
    terrible fear that her very reason was shaken by the intensity of her
    suffering.</p>
<p>As for Millicent, she snatched up, with a sort of frantic haste, a large shawl,
    that lay on the seat, and wrapped her head in it entirely, so as to shut out all
    sight and<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7184-142"/> sound, while the carriage rolled
    away from Rookcliffe and from him for ever—lost, and yet not less, for ever
    dear.</p>
<p>It was bitter to be roused anew to the conflict when she reached Milton Lodge;
    but concentrating all her thoughts on the prospect of that hour of rest, when
    she should quit England, she gathered up anew her strength, and proceeded at
    once to seek Mrs. Hartley, There was a sort of instinct which made her feel that
    here she would be thoroughly understood; that she need enter into no
    explanations, nor yet attempt to conceal the reality of her unutterable
    sacrifice. She felt, indeed, from many words of Mrs. Hartley’s, only now
    remembered, that she had known the truth long since, and that she would
    appreciate to the uttermost all Millicent had done and suffered.</p>
<p>The good old lady sat reading by the window. Millicent gently crept towards her
    and knelt down before her. One look passed<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7184-143"/>
    between them, and Mrs. Hartley read all that had taken place, in the expression
    of intolerable anguish which that sweet young face now bore; then Millicent laid
    her head upon her kind friend’s lap, and said, in a low, suffocated voice:—</p>
<p>“Dear kind friend, it is all over. I never, never more shall have a right to
    comfort him, or bless him with my whole heart’s love; I never, never shall look
    upon his face again. How shall I bear it?—my very soul seems dying in me! Oh,
    that she, at least, may love him, not as I did, that cannot be, but so that he
    shall be happy!”—She could not go on. Mrs. Hartley was deeply moved, and yet
    this was but the hour that she had long foreseen. She saw that as she had
    expected, a message had come from Heaven to the soul of Millicent Grey, to tell
    her that she had mistaken her rest and her vocation—that her rest could not be
    in this world, nor the vocation of her immortal<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7184-144"/> spirit to worship a human being or any other earthly thing. The messenger was
    dark and stern truly; and sharp the sword with which he had pierced that heart,
    to disengage it from the dust and clay to which it clung; but Mrs. Hartley knew
    that he was not the less an angel of mercy, and that in time the dim eyes of
    poor Millicent, made clearer by their bitter tears, would discern the glory of
    his countenance, and the radiance of the snow‐white wings that soon would bear
    her up to heaven.</p>
<p>She laid her hands on the poor drooping head that rested on her knees.</p>
<p>“Darling, I have long foreseen this hour; but take comfort. By this very
    suffering shall a sweeter shelter be provided for you than any human love—a
    happier home, my child, than any dwelling even with the most beloved—”</p>
<p>These words, were strangely soothing to poor Millicent, although she scarcely
        under‐<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7184-145"/> stood them. She gave one low
    sobbing sigh; and then lay still, exhausted by that fainting of the spirit,
    which has no strength for tears, scarce even for thought. But soon the goading
    recollection roused her that her work was not yet accomplished, that his
    happiness was not altogether secured, and she felt guilty to be resting even in
    her very desolation. She lifted up her poor wan face, the heavy eyes so full of
    the sad bewilderment of sorrow, and entreated of Mrs. Hartley to assist her in
    the task which yet remained, the obtaining of Colonel Bentley’s consent to his
    nephew’s marriage with Juliet, nor get his consent only, but his willing
    approbation and his promise that Aylmer should not the less be his heir, that he
    had failed to meet his wishes respecting Millicent.</p>
<p>She said there must be no delay in this matter, for she had sent a message to
    Stephen by Mr. Egerton, promising, that if<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7184-146"/>
    possible, he should have his uncle’s consent that very evening, for she well
    knew how deep must be his anxiety, to obtain the full assurance of that on which
    in part his union must depend.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley at once proposed to undertake the mission, and said she would go to
    her brother that very moment, trusting earnestly that she might be able to
    prevail with him, so that it should not be requisite for her to call on poor
    Millicent to come and plead with him for her own despair. With one fond pitying
    kiss she left her unhappy charge, who remained still crouching on the floor, her
    hands clasped over her eyes; for when the heart is crushed as hers was now, it
    seems impossible for the feeble knees to uphold the weary frame, or the heavy
    head to lift itself from the dust where most it is content to dwell.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley had anticipated a scene of violence with her brother, and much
        vehe‐<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7184-147"/> ment opposition to Aylmer’s
    marriage, but the reality far exceeded her expectation; not only did he pour
    forth a storm of invective against Juliet, Aylmer, and the whole Egerton family,
    but he reproached even Millicent herself, and solemnly declared that he would
    disinherit his nephew forthwith, unless she became his wife on the day
    appointed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley soon saw that she was quite powerless, and that the fiery scourge
    which had driven Millicent Grey to the accomplishment of all she had that day
    done, would not relax its cruel work till the whole of her bitter task should be
    fulfilled.</p>
<p>She went and brought her to Colonel Bentley; he was in the full paroxysm of
    ungoverned rage, his angry passions excited to the uttermost;—his powerless
    limbs quivered with the internal violence—his features were distorted—his voice,
    harsh and discordant, was uttering fierce words of menace. Then she came gliding
    in with<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7184-148"/> face so pale, stamped with the holy
    seal of sufferings—for she had accepted the agony of this last effort with the
    patient meekness of entire self‐devotion, and the soft submissive hands were
    folded on the torn and throbbing heart.</p>
<p>As the old man looked on her the angry tones died away on his lips, the stir of
    the human feelings seemed hushed within him as though by the presence of a thing
    unearthly. His fascinated gaze followed her movements. She came and knelt before
    him, for it seemed the only attitude in which she now found any rest. Very
    humble does intense love and intense suffering make us!</p>
<p>Then she lifted up the wan burning hands, and began to plead for Aylmer’s
    happiness and her own entire misery, with an eloquence of supplication which
    these weak words cannot render.</p>
<p>No mother, wrestling in agony for the life of her first‐born child, ever found
        such<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7184-149"/> power of beseeching prayer as rose in
    wailing entreaty from that broken heart.</p>
<p>She entered into no explanation as to what had passed—she gave no reason for thus
    seeking to place an irrevocable barrier between herself and him who had been the
    hope of this mortal life, only she said it was for his happiness, and she prayed
    the old man by the dear name of mercy, to grant her deep petition. She laid down
    her head upon his feet, and said she would not rise till he had promised to send
    forth a blessing on that friend beloved, peace to his heart, and the offering of
    the crowning cup of joy unto his lips. For herself, she said if he would hear
    her prayer, she would in return devote her life to him—she would come back to
    him when <emph>they</emph> were gone, and be to him a child, a niece, seeking
    with the care and devotedness of years, to repay him for his goodness and mercy
    to her, this day granted; and the old man’s heart<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7184-150"/> melted within him at the sound of that sweet
    intensely‐mournful supplication. The dark passion passed from his soul as the
    thunder cloud yields to the soft wind’s breath; he could not tell why, his own
    will and wishes had lost all power to influence him, so that now he could act by
    hers alone, but so it was, and he only longed to assure her he would do all and
    everything she wished. His arms fell around her, the tears came thick into his
    eyes, he muttered hoarsely, “My poor child, I will do all you desire;” and when
    at these words, she rose and smiled on him in her deep gratitude, the sweetness
    and the sadness of that smile was all too much; he bowed, his head upon his
    breast and wept.</p>
<p>There was no further delay, Colonel Bentley wrote the letter to his nephew
    instantly; it was dictated by Millicent herself, and it breathed only love and
    kindness, and the promise that all should be done to<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7184-151"/> ensure his happiness. With her own hands she carried
    it to the messenger who was to convey it to Rookcliffe, and when all was thus
    completed—terminated for ever—she allowed Mrs. Hartley to lay her down and
    compose her limbs in the attitude of repose; there she became in truth, like to
    the corpse of one whose hour of rest is come; and for many hours her friend sat
    moistening her white lips with cooling water, doubting almost whether the very
    life had not expired in her heart.</p>
<p>But the life was still there, the strong life turned to poison; and when morning
    broke, Millicent rose and made ready as for a journey. She told Mrs. Hartley,
    that great as had been her strength for endurance hitherto, she felt now there
    was a limit, beyond which the power of submission unto suffering could not go.
    To see again the faces of those who had been around her in her days of deep
    joy—to risk the mention<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7184-152"/> of his name, whose
    image was eating like canker into her soul was, she said, beyond the human
    nature to endure. She had decided on going to London that very day, and hence
    sailing for Aix as soon as might be.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley felt she was right, and that it was better for all parties that so
    it should be; she undertook to explain this very sudden departure to the
    Egertons, who, she felt convinced, would be thankful if such an arrangement were
    made; and in a very few hours Millicent was on her way to London, accompanied by
    Nanette and her servant. Thence a week later she departed for Aix.</p>
<p>As Mrs. Hartley anticipated, the family at Rookcliffe were greatly relieved at
    having her, who was in truth their victim, removed from before their eyes thus
    happily; and as Millicent came of age during her stay in London, all necessary
    arrangements were there made with the lawyers, to<pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7184-153"/> terminate Mr. Egerton’s guardianship, and leave her
    to act as she pleased, and to reside where she would.</p>
<p>From the moment of her departure all seemed to prosper according to their wishes.
    Aylmer, with the full consent of his uncle, hurried the preparations for his
    marriage with Juliet, which was already announced to the world; and in the
    delicious joy of having obtained that good, without which it had seemed so
    impossible to live, and of which he had despaired, he drove from him all thought
    of the past, and resolutely closed the eyes of his soul upon the mournful
    figure, whose image, at times, would steal across his spirit, looking up at him
    with sad reproaching eyes, and mutely wringing her pale hands.</p>
<p>There was one, however, to whom the news of Millicent Grey’s sudden departure was
    for a moment quite paralyzing; but gradually a little reflection taught him
        that<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7184-154"/> it was rather a matter of rejoicing
    to him—for who should prevent his walking in her shadow wheresoever she
    went—down into the very grave itself, would he not follow her? Yes! she was
    gone, but how? gone an outcast from earth’s affection, desolate as those are
    only, who having trusted their life and soul to human hands, have seen them
    shattered and for ever ruined in that ruthless grasp! The fair plant of living
    hoping love, that had sprung up and flourished in her trusting heart, having
    sweet promise of much fruit in joy, was cut down and withered to the very core,
    consumed into moulding dust; therefore, surely, the barren blighted soil where
    it had grown, was all the more fit to gather in new seed to blossom forth with
    happier affections.</p>
<p>This was his hope; and swift as those of Millicent Grey herself, the feet of
    Arthur Egerton were on the shores of France, but<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7184-155"/> unseen, unknown to her, gliding stealthily after her, to make his abode in
    secret near her dwelling, and there to wait his time; for deep selfishness makes
    a man most wise in his craftiness.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
<p><hi>AND</hi> what has the lapse of a year done for thee, old man? dweller with
    the dead, companion of a corpse? how has it fared with thee, John Forde, in this
    long period, during which the thronging souls of many thousands, have gone up to
    face eternity from the fever of the life‐long madness in which they fed
    themselves with ashes? The year which has seen the rise and fall of kingdoms—the
    convulsions of nations—the fading of many joys—the breaking of many<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7184-157"/> hearts—the wakening of new hopes in youthful
    breasts—the bringing in of many spirits from the unseen to pass their
    earth‐probation—and the year which has witnessed the wreck of a life, of which
    man could not have made one moment, but whose entire limit he had the will and
    power to destroy—the distorting, and paralyzing of a soul that came forth pure
    and glorious from the Creative Hands, by the sacrilegious touch of a being of
    dust and clay—while these things have been passing in the outer world, how has
    it fared with thee?</p>
<p>The year hath been to thee a wild and mournful dream, passionate and hopeless
    even as thy whole life; still hast thou sat there with thy head, now grey with
    age, bent down upon thy bosom, while round thee have been the clinging arms of
    that adored corpse, the dead eyes gazing on thy living face; the heart where
    feed the graveworms beating against thy burning breast.<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7184-158"/> Alas! old man, it is an awful meeting, surely, that
    is preparing for thee with that dead idol in the life to come, where already she
    has known full well the eternity, which haply thou hast lost for her!</p>
<p>John Forde had been apprised of Millicent’s return, but doubtless all
    recollection of it had passed again from his mind, too full of one absorbing
    idea to have the power of retaining any other. He sat in his usual attitude as
    she came into the room the same day that she arrived at Aix, and she paused to
    look upon him; for it was a strange thing to her to feel how thoroughly at last
    she understood him! Albeit life was in one sense to her but a deeper and more
    horrible enigma, yet, the secret of <emph>his</emph> existence was plain to her
    at least, for it had its root and spring in the same dark source as her own.</p>
<p>She advanced and stood before him, so that he lifted up his head to look upon
        her,<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7184-159"/> and suddenly a cry burst from his
    lips as if he had seen a vision; his dilated eyes seemed starting from their
    sockets. It was in sorrow that her mother had last gazed upon him; and in
    sorrow, as her child now met his eyes, the likeness which he never before had
    observed between them became strikingly apparent; he knew well it was not
        <emph>her</emph>, his own beloved—he never could be deceived in this; but it
    sent an aching pang into his heart, a shuddering thrill into his frame to see a
    living form so like to hers.</p>
<p>“Oh, what and who are you that come to me,” he said; “pale and stricken even as
    she came, mourning for her first‐born, with death at her heart, and anguish in
    her soul?”</p>
<p>“I am her most unhappy child,” said Millicent; “and like her, I come
    mourning,—mourning for my first‐born hope, which is a dead and buried corpse,
    and I would there<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7184-160"/> were the mortal death at my
    heart which wrought her rest so speedily, for truly there is the bitter anguish
    in my soul!”</p>
<p>“Her child—yes, it is true, I now remember all, you are her child, and in agony
    of heart! Millicent, she will not sleep calmly in her grave if this be so—can I
    not comfort you? I shall hear her wailing through the dust for you this night if
    sorrow is upon you; tell me what is your grief, that I may soothe you and bid
    her rest.”</p>
<p>“Alas! she will never more repose if my anguish can make her restless in her
    coffin! I have neglected your warning—I have forgotten your instructions, and
    therefore am I here a lost and stricken being. You bid me never seek to make my
    rest upon the hard rock of a human heart, but I have disobeyed you, and have
    laid down myself and my whole life upon it; and I have been driven forth from
    that inhospitable home,<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7184-161"/> all bruised and
    wounded, to fall down hopeless at your side.”</p>
<p>And she fell down as she spoke, abject as the despairing ever must be, whilst he
    bent over her in mute compassion, for there was entire sympathy between them
    now; their souls had met on the level of their common anguish; and the young
    girl, for whom the glory of life’s summer should but have been commencing, and
    the old man who was fast entering into the shadow of the tomb, were as one in
    their mutual desolation.</p>
<p>From that hour the life of Millicent Grey may be described in the single
        word—<emph>vacancy</emph>. We have said that she had no hope—nor thought of
    seeking any, beyond this life—and in this life, her lips had attested to the
    truth—all hope was dead, so it was darkness above and around, and utter apathy
    and lifelessness within. She had not yet learned the lessons which the history
        of<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7184-162"/> her existence had been appointed to
    teach her—she had believed that the spirit’s rest, the longing of the whole
    being, was to find its full satisfaction in human love; she had sought it there,
    and instead of rest had found a gnawing anguish; instead of a satisfying joy, an
    intolerable desolation; yet she continued to believe her early creed most true,
    convinced that this unhappy consummation was but the evil of her special
    destiny, and <emph>not</emph> the result of one incontestable truth—that in
    human love, as in all things human whatsoever, no soul immortal can repose. This
    lesson her future career was still to teach her; but meanwhile she did but
    believe, that she had risked a bold venture in the great game of life, and had
    for ever lost—that she was but one in a thousand. Multitudes like her might
    lose; some few might win: it was the mere playing at hazard, in which the fate
    of each one, for good or ill, was sealed as it<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7184-163"/>
    were by the fling of the dice. This was her wretched philosophy, poor child, for
    none had ever spoken truth to her, the sweet accents of mercy were unknown to
    her heart; but soon it was decreed that the voice of her own sorrow should speak
    them to her.</p>
<p>So day by day she wandered to and fro, the mute, pale semblance of a living
    agony. Aylmer had driven her out from his arms into a bleak, cold wilderness,
    and she was as a stray leaf blown by the blast of destiny upon that desolate
    shore.</p>
<p>She saw not the figure of him who watched her hour by hour, and ever sought to
    discover whether those despairing eyes seemed a shade less dreary, that he might
    come to speak to her of hope renewed; but Arthur dared not still approach her,
    for never yet had they looked up to tell his far‐off wistful gaze, of aught save
    love unchanging, even in its great despair.</p>
<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7184-164"/>
<p>One evening, when all was very still and lovely in the serene heavens and the
    quiet earth, Millicent Grey went forth in her miserable restlessness, to wander
    over the plain which extends beyond the fair town of Aix; and she dreamed once
    more, as she walked along, of that day to which ever her weary heart was
    turning,—the day when last she wandered the joyous bride of Stephen Aylmer,
    through the old woods of Rookcliffe,—before ever that fiend‐like soul, clad in
    angelic beauty, crossed her prosperous path,—the day when, for the first time,
    her eyes and his had looked on Juliet Egerton.</p>
<p>Overstepping the intervening anguish, she loved to rest upon that hour, the last
    of her departed brightness,—the closing scene of her dead life of joy; and as
    she thought upon it, all that she had suffered since, her intense, intolerable
    misery, of every moment,<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7184-165"/> day and hour, seemed
    to gather itself up in one vast load upon her breast, so that, unable to bear
    the overwhelming pressure, she lifted up her eyes with an awful appealing look
    to heaven, and gave vent to a long, deep sigh.</p>
<p>And now, hath it ever been known that the sigh of one poor helpless mourner, by
    the hand of a fellow creature stricken, ascending up to the retributive skies,
    hath been answered from thence, in thunders on the head of him who wrought the
    woe?</p>
<p>We know not,—we can but tell how it came to pass upon this night with Millicent
    Grey and Stephen Aylmer. On the selfsame evening, at the self‐same hour, that
    through the clear blue air of sweet Provence, that deep, heart‐breaking sigh
    went up, Stephen Aylmer walked with her, for whom he had committed murder on the
    life‐hope of a fellow mortal. In the fair<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7184-166"/>
    woods of Rookcliffe they stood, in the very path where he had stood with
    Millicent, on the night which she was now remembering in her agony,—and he, like
    her, remembered it; but only that in the recollection he might triumph with an
    unholy joy over the violent rending of the ties which then had bound him,—only
    that he might turn and look with a mad exultation on the glorious beauty which
    he had purchased to himself, with the despair of her who once had stood his
    promised wife upon that path beside him. The very thought how, in that hour,
    whose memory was upon him now, there had been an insurmountable barrier between
    himself and the radiant bride he had so dearly won, made him linger with a most
    cruel pleasure on the contrast of that day and this.</p>
<p>Beautiful as she was at all times, Juliet sought on this night to appear so to
    him surpassingly; she so gloried in her own<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7184-167"/>
    loveliness that she was never weary of continual efforts to attract renewed
    admiration; more especially was she desirous at all times to win Aylmer’s look
    of enthusiastic love,—not because her own affection yearned for such an answer,
    but because she delighted to satisfy the artist’s refined imagination, and to
    feel that she had subdued, to the worship of living beauty, the haughty soul,
    who so long had refused to acknowledge that aught supremely fair existed, save
    in his own mental visions.</p>
<p>She was wildly joyous this evening. He believed that she was so, because a few
    days more were to see her for ever consigned to him, as his wife. How would his
    heart have revolted from her, if he had known that her gaiety resulted from the
    delight, with which she anticipated going forth into the world with a free
    independence, under the sanction of his name, to gain the admiration of all whom
    her unholy soul might seek to<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7184-168"/> fascinate, and
    allow the fair face on which no eyes but a husband’s should have looked with
    joy, to be profaned by many an approving glance from others. She was ever most
    charming in her graceful vivacity, and with delight he watched her fitful
    movements now, each one calculated more than another to place her in some
    attitude of exquisite symmetry.</p>
<p>The evening was not calm and beautiful, as on the shores of France, but full of
    that ominous sultriness which often oppresses the air in the first warm days of
    early summer; black thunder‐clouds were passing across the troubled sky, and it
    was plain that a furious storm was brooding; at length a flash of vivid
    lightning rent asunder the thick dark curtain which obscured one part of the
    heavens, and the tempest, like a wild steed freed from the rein, came bounding
    forth in all its madness with thunders and with sweeping blasts.</p>
<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7184-169"/>
<p>At the first crash of that sublimest music, Aylmer drew Juliet closer to him, and
    proposed that they should at once return home, lest any danger chanced to her;
    but she was one naturally fearless, to whom the excitement of peril was
    delightful, and whose bold free spirit sympathized with those convulsions of
    nature. She loved to set even the elements at defiance, and to brave the very
    storms, for she had ever found her dominion over man so complete and boundless,
    that she dared control, from the powers of creation itself.</p>
<p>Instead of yielding to his entreaty that they should seek a refuge as speedily as
    might be, she answered him with a bright smile of daring, and springing from his
    grasp, darted on to a small hillock, which rose in a most exposed situation in
    the centre of the park; her swift feet brought her in an instant to the summit,
    where neither tree nor shrub were to be seen;<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7184-170"/>
    and there she stood, her graceful figure coming out in strong relief, with its
    white robes against the dark lurid sky, the fierce wind wantoning with her hair
    till it drove it, like a stream of golden sunshine, over her face, and her deep,
    dark eyes, lit up now with the glare from the heavens, turning back to him, with
    their sparkling glance of playful defiance.</p>
<p>He stood rooted to the spot gazing on her; his heart well‐nigh bursting with its
    fierce exultation to think that this being was his own.</p>
<p>Then her voice came sounding above the roar of the elements, sweet and clear as a
    silver bell.</p>
<p>“Take heed, <foreign xml:lang="fre">preux chevalier</foreign>, of your fame as a
    brave knight; why stand you there gazing, when I have passed through the storm,
    and believed you would follow me? Do you fear this great battle of heaven, where
    the lightnings are flashing<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7184-171"/> like swords? Oh,
    shame on the man’s failing heart, when the woman herself is undaunted!”</p>
<p>He answered the merry taunt with a smile as gay, and then bounded forth through
    the tempest, to fly to her. She saw him coming in the strength of his manhood,
    beautiful he seemed to her, and was in truth; noble the face and stately the
    form,—proud and free was the spirit within,—he came with his haughty steps firm
    on the ground, his doting eyes fixed on his earthly love. And then it was that
    in the still plains of the far Provence, the deep sigh went up,—the breath, as
    it were, of the breaking heart, and straightway, in the selfsame moment, from
    the angry heavens a thunderbolt came crashing down. It gleamed through the
    clouds, but it tarried not there; it lit up the mountains, but it had no mission
    to them; on through the boundless air direct to one spot, the fierce<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7184-172"/> dart of that lightning came—bright arrow of heaven—on
    the head of the guilty Aylmer it struck, with an aim unerring, and down, down to
    the dust, in the pride of his days, the strong man fell like a fainting
    child.</p>
<p>No sight more awful ever passed in the face of day, for the form that stood
    upright in its beauty and power, in one second of time had gone down to the
    earth as a shattered mass, burnt and blackened, a quivering heap! She saw it lie
    there a human frame, as it seemed, no longer, but a shapeless, distorted thing,
    horrible to see, fearful to think on; and wild through the air her piercing
    voice rang out, shriek upon shriek, in her agony of horror! One moment’s
    bewilderment, one moment doubt whether, it were possible that the proud, stately
    man, in this brief passing instant, had, indeed, been transformed into that
    black mass of cinders and ashes, where the stir of the life that yet lingered
        among<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7184-173"/> them but rendered the sight more
    terrible. And then the conviction that it was so indeed, that he was stricken
    down by the wrath of heaven, came deep and strong into her soul. It came and
    with it, to her clear, subtle mind, an image of all the results that must follow
    this awful event, and with well‐nigh a curse on her woman’s lips, for the sudden
    failing of her schemes of pleasure, she fled wailing and shrieking through the
    woods of the park. She fled, but not to him, for she loved him not, pure love
    would have overcome the revolting of humanity, from the sight of the blackened,
    palpitating mass; but Juliet even in that hour, had a care for herself.</p>
<p>She had a horror of death, a horror of suffering, a horror of all which could
    render life, to her eyes, other than a bright vision of triumph. To
        <emph>enjoy</emph> all the world can give, with an intensity of selfishness,
    was her aim and her principle, her hope and her faith;<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7184-174"/> whatever aided this plan of existence was sought for
    and cherished,—whatever marred or destroyed it was hated and abandoned;—whilst
    Aylmer could assist her in attaining her object, she trampled all under foot to
    bind him to her. But now, when by this awful judgment, he could do so no longer,
    even though life yet lingered in the scorched and distorted frame; already was
    she his no more. She must act her part for the time, however, and truly she had
    no need to feign her consternation, for she did feel an intensity of dismay as
    well as sore grief and anger for the destruction of her own bright hopes,—so
    shrieking and in tears she fled on to her home, and sent them forth to bring
    back the shattered corpse (it might be) of her lover. But they found him still
    living, and it was the lingering of life in that calcined heap which most struck
    on their hearts with horror; not a feature was discernible, seared, blackened,
    and scorched,<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7184-175"/> not a limb but was full of
    distortion, and evidently paralyzed by the dreadful shock.</p>
<p>They carried him home in mute terror and grief; physicians were procured, but
    they said if he did not die at once, it would be many days before they could
    give an opinion; the great dread seemed to be of his living, so frightful, if he
    did, must be the life in that stricken frame. Then followed an interval of
    dreariness and mourning—the house silent and darkened—the voices hushed—the
    steps of attendants only stealing to and fro. Mrs. Hartley came from Milton
    Lodge, and night and day waited unremittingly on her unhappy nephew. Mrs.
    Egerton, too, was ever at his side; but Juliet declared that her delicate frame
    could not endure such fatigue and anxiety; she retired to her own suite of
    rooms, and there surrounded herself with everything bright and pleasant, that
    could shut out all thought of the horrid scenes else‐<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7184-176"/> where enacted in the house. She was but waiting for
    the medical decision, to know whether this stricken man could ever more be made
    available for the purposes of her life.</p>
<p>After a time, the fiat of the physicians was definitely given; Stephen Aylmer
    would live—but he would live, blind and a paralyzed cripple: stone blind he was,
    and irrevocably so; he that with such idolatry had worshipped the Beautiful,
    upon the beautiful never more should be allowed to gaze; not only the sight was
    gone, but the very eyes were burnt up in their sockets; nor was this all, a
    complete paralysis had possession of his frame. It might with the lapse of time
    diminish, the physicians said, but the limbs would never regain their form, nor
    the features lose that fatal distortion. So convulsed the frame—so seared the
    once fair countenance, that Stephen Aylmer, proud and noble as he had been, was
    now an object moat unsightly, from which com‐<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7184-177"/>
    passion only, could prevent his fellow creatures turning even with loathing! His
    faculties were unimpaired, excepting the hopeless fearful blindness, of which he
    had a full consciousness, from the moment that his senses returned.</p>
<p>When Juliet heard the final report of the case, and learnt distinctly that there
    could be no further change, she expressed a wish to see him, but that he should
    not himself be made aware of her presence; she was one who chose always to be
    convinced on any matter of moment by personal observation, and she desired to
    confirm with her own eyes the information she had received respecting it. If
    indeed, it were correct, she must straightway depart to seek for other
    instruments to effect her enjoyment in this life; and into the presence of him,
    now powerless to serve her, she never more would come.</p>
<p>So she went into the darkened room where he lay, and with no gentle hand<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7184-178"/> drew back the curtain from the window, that
    she might the better scan his countenance. We have described the revolting
    spectacle that wretched man presented, for truly he was but a living soul,
    linked to a mass of powerless clay; she looked on him, and over that beautiful
    face there passed an expression of contemptuous disgust! Who shall measure the
    degradation to her whole being, of which that look gave evidence! Then she let
    the curtain fall, restoring him truly to a two‐fold gloom, and passed from his
    presence for ever. They never met again on this side of the grave.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
<p><hi>JULIET EGERTON</hi> left Rookcliffe the day after her silent interview with
    the man, who, for her sake had bartered honour and truth, and righteousness; she
    said, that after the shock her nerves had received, her health required an
    entire change. She returned to Italy with her friend Mrs. Wilmot, and not many
    months after she was the wife of an Italian nobleman.</p>
<p>The first word that Stephen Aylmer uttered when his speech returned to him was
    “Juliet;” he had been quite conscious<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7184-180"/> long
    before the paralysis was so far overcome as to allow him to articulate, but even
    then he could utter only the unformed hesitating sounds, which form so painful a
    peculiarity in the palsied; and this defect, the physicians said, could never
    more be remedied. He who had so largely possessed the gift of free and noble
    eloquence, whose voice had been as most melodious music, must never speak but in
    those gabbling hateful accents, and of them, at present, he could make use but
    sparingly.</p>
<p>Still, his first word of difficult utterance was “Juliet,”—it was to Mrs. Hartley
    he spoke, who sat beside him; he had formerly manifested by signs, that he was
    fully aware both of his irrevocable blindness and of his melancholy paralysis;
    therefore, she knew he would understand her, and she thought it best he should
    know the truth of Juliet’s desertion at once. The tone of agonizing anxiety in
    which he uttered that name,<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7184-181"/> showed that he
    well knew what he had to fear; her answer was to bend down over him and whisper,
    “Heaven have mercy upon you, and give you strength to endure the life which has
    been restored to you.”</p>
<p>The look of agony which settled down upon the countenance, already made hideous
    by its distortion, as she spoke these words, was too dreadful for her to look
    upon; she saw that he had understood his cruel abandonment,—he lifted up the one
    scorched arm of which alone he retained the use, and hid his face upon it,
    whilst he said in a tone that told how fearful an import he gave to the
    words:—</p>
<p>“It is darkness—darkness without and within!”</p>
<p>From that hour he sank into a complete and most mournful lethargy; nothing could
    induce him to utter a word, and he never spoke again for many months—he became
    as a mass of lifeless clay in their hands.</p>
<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7184-182"/>
<p>They might move him from place to place—they might try remedies of all sorts they
    might leave him alone or surround him with the gaiety wherewith they thought to
    enliven him, he seemed alike indifferent and unconscious of all; he had not yet
    recovered the power of walking, though it was hoped he might ultimately regain
    the use of his limbs, and day after day he lay like an inanimate heap, refusing
    to respond so much as by a pressure of the hand to the solicitude of those
    around him. It was as though the soul like the body were palsied for ever; no
    one could look on him without grieving that he had not expired altogether under
    the blow which had deprived him of light, and hope, and joy, and all but the
    mere mechanical process of life.</p>
<p>It seemed plain that this regret was so strong in his own breast, that he sought
    to be in actual truth as one dead already; no word ever passed the parched
        lips—no<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7184-183"/> voluntary movement ever indicated
    that there was life in the frame; and, yet it was an awful thing to think on all
    that was really passing behind the impenetrable barrier, which his sightless
    eyes and his resolute dumbness had raised between himself and the rest of
    mankind.</p>
<p>Fearful, indeed, to feel that the soul <emph>was</emph> alive, a prisoner—in
    darkness, silence, and solitude, within that dungeon of powerless flesh, and not
    alive alone, but with powers unimpaired, only that they could no more be
    exercised,—with talents undiminished, only that they must lie rotting in
    inaction,—with wishes unquenched,—only that for ever vain they must eat into his
    heart like fire, and with the strong fierce ungovernable love which had made him
    in his pride of strength and beauty, perjured and well nigh a murderer, still as
    deep and as wildly resistless,—only that the hope so near a reality, of its
    entire blessedness in her con‐<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7184-184"/> tinual presence
    had been torn away from him, like the rending of the very life from his body.
    There remained nothing now but the maddening certainty that he might with
    unabated affection yearn and pine for her, as a mother over a slaughtered child;
    but that more readily the dead would rise at the call of love in agony, than
    Juliet Egerton return now to him, to be the maimed and wretched cripple’s
    wife.</p>
<p>Oh, the howling tempest, incessant, day and night, that raged beneath that
    lifeless calm exterior!—the world and the things of it had been all in all to
    him, and from that world he was now debarred as utterly as any captive, chained
    in some prison, fathoms deep within the earth; but its influence was strong as
    ever, and whilst he lay powerless and like some senseless clod—the ardent,
    earthly love—the burning ambition—ambition alike of joy and fame, were trampling
    down his very soul with their mad impatient<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7184-185"/>
    struggling for release. He knew well, however, the utter hopelessness of his
    condition, and it was despair which bound him in that frightful changeless
    lethargy.</p>
<p>Thus the days passed on for Stephen Aylmer, once as proud and noble a
    representation of humanity as ever mortal eyes beheld; the gifted genius,—the
    man of winning eloquence and lofty intellect, subduing many minds to his,—now
    cast there at the feet of any who came to look on him with pity,—a spectacle
    revolting from infirmity, piteous to behold, in his blind solitude and dumb
    despair.</p>
<p>It became necessary to remove him from Rookcliffe, whose threshold truly, his
    feet had passed only to bring dark evils in their train. Mrs. Hartley
    determined, for the present, to devote herself to him, though it was sad for her
    to leave the poor old Colonel, now half broken‐hearted with his nephew’s
    calamity.</p>
<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7184-186"/>
<p>The physicians recommended that Aylmer should be conveyed to certain baths, in a
    mountainous region of Switzerland, and thither Mrs. Hartley proceeded with him,
    as soon as he was able to move.</p>
<p>It was thought that the efficacy of these mineral waters, would gradually restore
    to him the use of his limbs, as well as his power of articulation; and this
    expectation was ultimately realized; but it was many months before any such
    result took place, and in the interval he was unable to bear an exertion greater
    than that of being wheeled in his chair from room to room. It was during this
    period, however, that the events occurred which must now be recorded.</p>
<p>The dwelling in which Mrs. Hartley fixed their abode was a solitary <foreign xml:lang="fre">châlet</foreign>, half hidden among the rocks and pine trees
    of lofty Swiss mountains; the baths were close at hand, but at that season,
    fortunately for<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7184-187"/> Aylmer, the place was entirely
    deserted, and the solitude as complete as even his despairing heart could have
    desired. It was not until things were completely established in this new home
    that Mrs. Hartley determined on making Millicent Grey acquainted with all that
    had taken place. No one had written to her from Rookcliffe, feeling, perhaps,
    that it was at once too painful and too difficult a subject, and her kind old
    friend knew well, therefore, that she was at present under the firm persuasion
    that Juliet Egerton was the most happy wife of him she had loved as a woman
    loves but once.</p>
<p>It was impossible to divine all that might occur when Millicent should be made
    aware of the truth, but Mrs. Hartley was resolved that she should be acquainted
    with the simple facts without word or comment from any one, and that the result
    must be left as a problem which no human hand could solve.</p>
<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7184-188"/>
<p>She had deeply felt, throughout the whole of the strange drama, which had been
    played in the lives of Millicent and Aylmer, that powers, not of earth, were,
    dealing with them; she knew, by the instinct of those who have been enabled,
    because of their very simplicity, to draw deeply from the wells of spiritual
    knowledge, that this was a case with which no mortal dared tamper: clearly there
    was a struggle going on for the souls of these two living creatures, and the
    judgment which had fallen on Stephen, with the whole series of events now
    passing was but the outward machinery, of the hidden power that was working
    within them.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley would not venture to interfere by word or act in the development of
    their destiny; she conceived it to be her part merely to sit by a silent
    spectator,—ready, if ever human agents seemed necessary, to step in and befriend
    them both. This much of active duty only she believed<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7184-189"/> was hers in the matter, to take care that Millicent
    should be apprised of all the truth, and then she would leave her to act as she
    might be led by mysterious influences, too subtle for her human eyes to
    discern.</p>
<p>And Mrs. Hartley wrote,—she gave a simple detail of the awful calamity which had
    befallen Stephen Aylmer, and of his present condition. She quietly stated the
    fact of Juliet’s marriage, which had just taken place, without even the delay
    that a mere consideration for the forms of the world would have demanded, of
    her, so recently engaged to the unhappy man whose sore punishment she had left
    him to bear alone. Further, Mrs. Hartley gave a brief account of their present
    mode of life in Switzerland; she and her nephew were, she said, entirely
    alone,—not only cut off, as they wished to be, from all society, but with only
    one or two servants, as Aylmer could not endure the tumult of many per‐<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7184-190"/> sons near him. She concluded by saying, that
    on this account he required from her more attendance than she was able, at her
    advanced age, to give him; that it would have been well if she could have read
    to him for several hours each day, in order to withdraw his mind from the
    distracting thoughts which, notwithstanding his unbroken silence, she knew must
    be preying on him; especially as at night he was often seized with paroxysms of
    pain, which rendered it necessary that he should be carried into a freer current
    of air, and watched over for hours together.</p>
<p>This letter arrived at Aix one day when Millicent Grey was walking in the garden
    with Arthur Egerton. It was now some time since he had made her aware of his
    presence in the town, and had been admitted to her society; he had not decided
    on taking this step, however, because he had perceived in her any indication of
        that<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7184-191"/> forgetfulness of the past, which
    could alone give him hope.</p>
<p>So far from that, it was rather because he had found it too great torture, to
    watch unseen the hourly manifestation of the deep, loving faithfulness, even in
    anguish, of that breaking heart,—and the longing to hear her voice again, to
    meet her sweet, sorrowful smile, drove him, almost as hopeless as herself, into
    her presence at last. It was at first a great shock to her to see him,—she
    thought it would be utterly insupportable to her, to look again one of those who
    had been around her the time of her dream‐like joys—when she could lift up her
    loving eyes, upon the dear face, for which she now pined, as one in utter
    darkness pants for a ray of light; but after a time she found that when the mind
    is intensely absorbed by one great agony of thought, no outward circumstances
    can much affect it. She saw that it was<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7184-192"/> as
    life to Arthur Egerton to be with her, and her sweet, gentle nature was not
    changed; she was willing and glad to give him, what she felt was but the poor
    joy of living in her presence, for she never imagined one single instant, that
    he could suppose it possible for her so much as to tolerate the expression of
    any other love than that of Stephen Aylmer’s.</p>
<p>Millicent Grey was one of those, whose refinement of spirit and instinctive
    purity of feeling causes them to hold, almost as a holy doctrine, the sacredness
    of the one affection sufficing for a lifetime,—it was to her a very sacrilege,
    to think of giving to another, that throne within her soul where she had placed
    one only human being; what though he had abandoned that high dwelling, and left
    her breast a desert waste, yet had she consecrated her life and herself to him
    (woe to her that she dared so to do by any human being!)—and now it was re‐<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7184-193"/> volting to her, even to suppose that any
    would dare to profane that offering, by so much as a word of affection.</p>
<p>Long before she had learned these things by her own experience, it had been to
    her one of the bewildering anomalies of this world, that any should have the
    power or the will, to admit two affections into their life; she would as soon
    have thought of holding two opposing creeds at once.</p>
<p>Millicent never dreaded, then, any expression of attachment from Arthur, for she
    imagined he must plainly understand this feeling, and share in it himself, and
    she therefore admitted him to her presence, the more compassionately that
    herself would have been so well content but to have received a like permission
    to hear the voice and see the face of him she loved, as hopelessly as she
    believed herself to be beloved.</p>
<p>She was so far right in her conclusion, that Arthur did read and understand
        the<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7184-194"/> depths of that heart thus consecrated
    to one feeling only, but still in his own madness of hope, he would not
    despair,—he had so worked himself into a frantic intensity of love for her, that
    he felt, what was in truth the case, an utter impossibility within his soul to
    endure the absence of all hope; such a consummation would produce, he felt
    certain, a very convulsion in his nature; and he clung to the faintest shadow of
    a chance with the tenacity of one who feels he is grasping, as it were, at the
    last shreds of life.</p>
<p>He persuaded himself, also, that he was not so utterly mad, in refraining as yet
    from despair, because Millicent gradually manifested some pleasure in his
    society. She did not hide from him, but that was merely because she found a
    melancholy enjoyment in talking with him of the days of her departed happiness;
    it seemed to prove to her that all was not a dream,—to<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7184-195"/> convince her of what, in her extremity of
    wretchedness, she almost doubted, even that joy <emph>did</emph> exist in the
    world, and had existed for herself; but still, though he knew this was the
    feeling, which made a faint light steal into those sweet dim eyes when he came
    near, it was not only unutterable enjoyment to him to meet their glance, but a
    something less than hopelessness to win it.</p>
<p>So they walked in the garden together, and Arthur was thinking, during one of the
    long fits of abstraction into which Millicent fell perpetually, that,
    notwithstanding the exquisite torture it was to him, to see the faithfulness of
    her soul to Stephen Aylmer, this was still, well‐nigh, the brightest, period of
    his existence,—for she was his alone, at least, to look upon; <emph>he</emph>
    only heard her voice, <emph>he</emph> only gazed upon her face, none shared with
    him the air she breathed,—he could close the eyes of his memory, as it were, and
    believe for a moment that her<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7184-196"/> inward love was
    his alone, as fully as her outward presence. And then it was to him, ineffable
    delight, to gloat over the fact in which he implicitly believed—that Stephen
    Aylmer was long since the husband of his sister Juliet; he had no reason to
    suppose the contrary, as he had carefully concealed from his family where he had
    made his abode, and, consequently, had received no tidings from them.</p>
<p>It was Nanette who brought Mrs. Hartley’s letter, she came running as fast as her
    little feet could carry her; for she knew that if anything could have rendered
    the spirit of poor Millicent more desolate and heavy than it had been these many
    months, it was the singular silence which all her English friends had so long
    preserved;—she little dreamed their motive!</p>
<p>She believed that they had abstained from writing out of tenderness to herself,
    because they must have communicated the<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7184-197"/> fact
    of Stephen’s marriage. Mrs. Hartley, especially, who, at first, had been her
    regular correspondent, she could well imagine had lost the courage, to write her
    the details of that which was her life’s calamity; yet she felt that if this was
    their motive, it was a most mistaken kindness. What was the one object she had
    set before herself when she entered on the stern and terrible path of complete
    self‐sacrifice? Was it not his happiness, and his alone—was not this the reward
    to which she looked when with her own hand she plunged, as it were, a knife into
    her breast, and had she not then a right to know that her work was accomplished,
    and her mournful recompense granted unto her?</p>
<p>Poor little Nanette, who had been utterly bewildered by all that occurred in
    England, the whole proceedings being most incomprehensible to her, had, after a
    vain attempt to discover who it was she ought to hate for Mil‐<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7184-198"/> licent’s sake, decided on remaining enraged with the
    whole world, except Père André,—because some one, she did not know who, had
    somehow, she could not tell why, made her darling miserable! but most of all she
    was furious at finding Millicent again consigned to the barren solitude of her
    life at Aix. To poor John Forde, Nanette had a mortal antipathy, resulting from
    what she conceived to be his most unjustifiable obstinacy, in maintaining a
    gloomy silence. Talking was to this good little woman, the great business and
    pleasure of life, and she looked upon it as a positive crime in her master to
    throw away his gift in this respect,—she declared he was worse than any owl she
    ever had heard of,—for they <emph>did</emph> hoot at night, which Monsieur Forde
    never condescended to do; and her great object was to induce Millicent to leave
    him, lest she should acquire the same fatal propensity.</p>
<p>The arrival on this day, therefore, of a<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7184-199"/> letter
    for Miss Grey, was a source of immense delight to her, as she trusted it might
    contain her recall to England. So tumbling along like a little, fat, round
    tortoise in a hurry, Nanette made all speed through the mulberry walks to her
    mistress.</p>
<p>“Une lettre, une lettre,” she shouted, pitching her shrill voice at some
    extraordinary height; “it comes, I dare say, from that detestable Angleterre (Je
    n’ose pas dire ce maudit pays, le Père André ne permet pus de jurements; mais
    c’est égal, je sais ce que je pense). Une lettre, ma chérie, ça te fera sourire
    peut‐être.”</p>
<p>It was not a smile, however, but an ashy paleness, which spread over the face of
    Millicent Grey as she took the letter in her hand.</p>
<p>She never doubted but that it contained the news of the final union of Aylmer and
    Juliet; and though she did in all sincerity desire the assurance of that
    happiness for<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7184-200"/> which she had laboured with such
    bitter toil, yet the thought of seeing the irrevocable words made her spirit
    quail within her.</p>
<p>She tore it open and began to read; Arthur watched her with a most inhuman
    exultation, for he interpreted the arrival of the letter as she did; and it is
    extraordinary, when a powerful principle, like that of his love for Millicent,
    is working in the mind of a man, unguarded by the yet loftier and supreme aim of
    inward rectitude, how it turns all other feelings within the soul to very
    poison.</p>
<p>Suddenly, however, his cruel pleasure passed away, and he stood aghast as he saw
    the wild, changing expressions which were passing over the face of Millicent
    Grey, like clouds driven by an inward tempest; he saw at once that some
    extraordinary tidings must have done this. The mere confirmation of the misery,
    which she<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7184-201"/> had so resolutely accepted as her
    portion, by the announcement of Aylmer’s marriage, could never have aroused all
    the passionate feelings which he saw were agitating her now; that would have
    produced only the settled fearful calm of utter hopelessness, but nosy there was
    plainly on that expressive countenance—horror, and sorrow, and anxiety. What
    could it all mean? Suddenly Millicent let the letter fall, and clasped her
    shaking hands, with a wild mournful cry.</p>
<p>Honour be to the true woman’s heart within her; she did not for one moment exult
    that Juliet never was—never would be his wife, nor triumph in her base and
    heartless desertion, so different to the deep love, faithful in uttermost
    despair, which came gushing round her heart at that moment. No, she had but one
    thought in this hour, it was for his suffering; but one desire,—to weep and to
    struggle, and to<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7184-202"/> spend her life in
    heart‐breaking supplication, that he might be restored to light, to joy, to
    comfort by any means, in any way; and never—never would she ask that in this
    renewed life, he should bless her with so much as a thought!</p>
<p>“Millicent, what has happened? In the name of mercy, speak! say what has
    happened? Why do you look so wildly to heaven—what can have occurred? They are
    married, are they not? Aylmer is married! only say that nothing has prevented
    his marriage with my sister!”</p>
<p>The cold drops literally stood like dew on his forehead as the terror took
    possession of him, that some event might have occurred to prevent that
    union.</p>
<p>Millicent pointed to the letter, intimating that he might read it himself; then
    speaking rather to her own fainting soul than to him, she exclaimed—</p>
<p>“Oh, why am I here? What have I to do<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7184-203"/> in this
    place? <emph>he</emph> is suffering in pain, in darkness, in solitude; and why
    am I lingering here?”</p>
<p>She smote on her breast, as though like a guilty one, she would have breathed out
    her own confession of sin; and then bounding from the spot with the energy as of
    a new life awakening in her, she disappeared from his sight.</p>
<p>And he too read the letter;he read that record of the working of mysterious
    powers in this matter, where he had deeply sworn he would accomplish his own
    will. He had been willing, if need be, to accomplish it by the sacrifice of all
    that is noble or holy in the soul of man, and by that unrighteous offering, it
    had seemed to him that already he had effected much, and was likely to effect
    much more. He, it was, in actual fact, who had torn Millicent from Aylmer’s
    love; his were the hands that dug out the great gulf which had divided them,<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7184-204"/> and now when that consummation was on the
    very point of taking place, which was, as he believed, to have flung her,
    wounded in spirit, broken in heart, into his grasping arms,—the very thunders
    had bestirred themselves to send the lightning‐flash, which had again removed
    the barrier from between Millicent Grey and Stephen Aylmer! It were not easy to
    describe the impotent rage of this unhappy man, when he found that these things
    were so. True, Stephen was a helpless cripple, and in this he boldly rejoiced;
    for as we have said, his whole mind was perverted by the influence of the fierce
    passion which ruled him; but he felt not the less, that since no union with
    another could separate them now, this very infirmity and suffering would but
    make Millicent cling the more closely to him, and live the more devotedly for
    him, in heart and soul, even though she never took the name of his wife.</p>
<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7184-205"/>
<p>Arthur felt that he should lose that sweet presence now, in which he had lived,
    as we live in the warmth and light of the sun in heaven. He saw not only that
    she would go to Aylmer, flying back to him like the stricken bird to its beloved
    nest, but that even if he followed her there, it would be to see her so wrapt
    and absorbed, in but the mere fact that Stephen Aylmer was present with her,
    (though even still in heart estranged,) that never more would fall on him so
    much as one of those pitying glances for which his longing spirit pined.</p>
<p>And this just when faint gleams of hope were stealing, however falsely, into his
    dark life. Oh, that he could have annihilated the truth contained in that letter
    which he tramples under his feet now in frantic rage! But soon this first burst
    of passion subsided, and a feeling rose within him, which produced a complete
    though a fearful calm.</p>
<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7184-206"/>
<p>It was the conviction, joined to the indomitable resolution, that he must and
    would obtain this, the object and desire of <emph>his</emph> soul, or perish
    most utterly in the struggle; he had ever felt that his whole heart—his whole
    being demanded the presence at least, if not the love of Millicent Grey, as a
    stern necessity—a principle of life for life required; and he knew, as if it had
    been revealed to him of another man than himself, that whilst the human breath
    yet lingered on his lips, and the vital flame burnt in his breast, he would so
    toil and battle for the attainment of this, the great good of his existence;
    that at least, his worst of failure, should be, her expiring with him in the
    mortal strife.</p>

<head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><hi>SWEET</hi> and fresh as an angel’s breath came the mountain air through that
    open window, and the music of nature’s deep voice was with it; a voice most
    glorious, the mingling of many tones ever chanting the same burden, the great
    mystery of love. What aching heart ever heard it and refused comfort? None who
    understand the language it speaks; but there are some who do not, and Stephen
    Aylmer was one! The melody with which it sung to‐day, was the<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7184-208"/> rushing sound of the wind in the pine‐grove, and the
    far off echo of falling waters. So soft, so soothing, one would have thought it
    must have stolen into his charmed soul and wakened him from that frightful
    lethargy; but the soul <emph>was</emph> awake for its own greater agony, the
    lethargy was but of body, assumed, that none might torture him by probing his
    cankering wound, or remind him that he yet belonged, blind and degraded,
    helpless and despairing, to that race among whom he had walked as of a nature
    superior to all;—so strong in his talent and beauty, having but to stretch forth
    his hand, to take at his will, of earthly joys offered to him by the noblest and
    fairest.</p>
<p>He lay in the position which he seldom changed, on a sofa drawn close to the
    window; the face scarred and seared by the scorching of heaven’s own fire, to
    that heaven was upturned in sullen despair; the<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7184-209"/> darkened eyes closed—the lips indomitably sealed; the hands into which the
    power of movement was beginning to return, laid motionless on his breast.</p>
<p>It was thus that he remained day after day, taking no heed of any, manifesting
    neither pleasure nor pain at all that was done for him, yet making it
    sufficiently plain that he was not only always perfectly conscious, but that his
    unimpaired senses had acquired that acuteness which blindness most often
    produces. It would be impossible to conceive a figure more perfectly expressive
    of a rigid, mute, and dogged suffering:—in every line of that countenance, and
    even of that listless frame these words seemed written‐</p>

    <l>“Would to heaven I had died!”</l>
</quote>
<p>Mrs. Hartley sat by his side; and often the work which occupied her fell from her
    hands whilst she lifted up her eyes to look<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7184-210"/> on
    that melancholy picture, and wonder if ever those pale stern lips, closed over
    such tortures, would open to reveal them again; and then in her beautiful
    patience of faith she would resume her employment, feeling sure that the strange
    dark history was not yet over, the probation not fulfilled, the trial not
    complete; and the working of mighty influences with Millicent and Stephen
    Aylmer, still progressing with a secret energy and power, that soon would reveal
    itself in great events.</p>
<p>Whilst Mrs. Hartley thus pondered, she heard a movement in the room without,
    which was divided from that in which she sat, by a door, now standing wide open:
    what she heard was the echo of a faint footfall, with a sort of fluttering
    sound, and the whisper of a soft, sobbing breath.</p>
<p>The impression it gave her was as though some poor dove, with throbbing breast
    and failing wing, had come wandering in, and<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7184-211"/>
    was expiring there,—but her own heart’s sympathy told her what it really was.
    She rose and passed into the other room, where she found, as she expected, poor
    Millicent Grey leaning against the wall with a face white as marble, and hands
    icy cold, faint, and opprest, almost dying under the overwhelming conviction
    that she was breathing the same air as Stephen Aylmer.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley took her in her arms, and let her lie there silent, feeling with
    intense pity the quick, fearful throbbing of that poor heart against her own.
    She said merely what she knew would give her a soothing assurance.</p>
<p>“I expected you; I hoped you would come.” And then kissed the quivering lips that
    had not power to answer. Millicent lay very still in that kind embrace for a few
    minutes; but when she raised herself Mrs. Hartley saw that her dilated eyes<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7184-212"/> were fixed with the most painful anxiety on
    the door of communication; she released her instantly, and went to close it,
    lest any sound should reach Stephen Aylmer; and returning to her, said
    softly,—</p>
<p>“You are right, he is there:” her words sent the blood back to that heaving
    breast. Millicent tottered for a moment on her failing feet, but they carried
    her at once to the spot, and kneeling down, she rested her head against the wood
    which separated her from him who had trampled with cruel feet upon her heart,
    and to whom that heart was rising up again in this his hour of desertion and
    solitude, faithful and tender as the day he had first asked it from her,</p>
<p>It seemed to give her great rest and peace to remain there, in that attitude, and
    Mrs. Hartley did not disturb her. She saw that she was becoming quite composed,
    and she waited quietly till she rose and came towards her; then she drew her to
    her side,<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7184-213"/> and Millicent began in a low,
    beseeching tone:</p>
<p>“You said you expected me; then you will let me stay—you will let me be with him
    to watch over him, as no mother ever watched over a darling child, to toil and
    slave and work for him. His poor darkened eyes will never know who waits on him,
    and you could not condemn him to a hired service in his sufferings—when such an
    ocean of deep free love is here! you could not condemn me to such a death in
    life, as to know him full of pain, and wretched, and I not here to soothe and to
    tend him! Oh, you will let me stay; surely he is my own, mine, by a love that
    has no name in human words; mine by the sacredness with which his image has lain
    in my soul, through all my night of gloom, unprofaned by a thought but of the
    most devoted tenderness. <emph>She</emph> has deserted him; let him not think
    there is no truth, no purity of faithfulness remain‐<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7184-214"/> ing in the world,—surely, he is my own, my
        treasure;—<emph>she</emph> thought that treasure worthless, because of his
    darkened eyes, and his crippled form; but to me his infirmity, his helplessness,
    his misery, does make him only more dear, more deeply, more intensely dear. Say
    that I shall stay with him, to be as his hired servant,—it is ennobling to wait
    on those who are sacred by suffering. Oh, say the word, for in truth, I cannot
    leave him; my life would pass from me in the effort.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley had let her go on making all this humble, imploring petition,
    because, in fact, she was almost suffocated by the emotion which that mournful
    pleading voice, and those words wrought in her; but now she exerted herself to
    speak.</p>
<p>“You shall stay with him, darling; it is, in truth, your place, allotted to you
    by no hand of man. He shall be your care, and you his gentle protector, for he
    is helpless<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7184-215"/> as an infant. The strong has
    become weak, and the weak how marvelously strong! Strange things have come to
    pass, truly, and stranger yet await us, if I mistake not. But I tamper not with
    it, go where you are led,—do as the hidden guiding bids you. Only, sweet
    Millicent,” she hesitated, dreading the effect of her words, “he must never know
    that it is you who are his kind attendant.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley felt convinced, knowing how Juliet yet occupied his whole soul, that
    Millicent’s presence would be insupportable to him were he aware of it.</p>
<p>Millicent’s face blanched at the words: she most fully understood them, but she
    answered calmly, for she had that strength within her now which most women
    acquire, in time of trial for the weal of others, even when they are weakest for
    their own.</p>
<p>“Yes, I am fully aware he must not ever know it. It would deeply pain him, I<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7184-216"/> know well, and would, in truth, be very sad
    for him, to feel that one so hated was near him. But I will be very careful, and
    I do not think that he will recognize my voice. I am so changed in that and in everything.<corr>”</corr></p>
<p>“You are, indeed, my own poor child. I do not think that there is any fear,” said
    Mrs. Hartley, sadly; for truly it was a heart‐breaking thing now to hear poor
    Millicent’s voice,—the dear, birdlike tones had died into so sad, uncertain a
    murmur, always weak and trembling, as though with the load of suppressed
    emotion.</p>
<p>Even as Juliet Egerton had chosen to look on the stricken man alone, when he was
    not aware of her presence, so did Millicent Grey now desire to see him. The one
    had so willed it, that in her cold, calculating selfishness, which seemed to
    belie the very woman’s nature belonging to her, she might ascertain the
    incapacity of Aylmer to serve her any further, and then<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7184-217"/> desert him for ever; the other cherished this wish
    solely that no one, not even himself, might be aware of the lowly loving homage
    she pined to render unto one, now sacred in her eyes by suffering.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley said she might go at once quietly in to see him, as the blind man,
    even if he heard a movement near him, would take no notice of it, and afterwards
    she herself would tell him that she had provided a new attendant for him, when
    Millicent might enter without delay on her chosen and noble duty.</p>
<p>So soon as the desired permission was thus given, Millicent rose. She was
    resolutely calm, and Mrs. Hartley saw <emph>her</emph>, whom he had betrayed and
    deserted,—whose spirit he had wounded,—whose life he had destroyed,—glide into
    the presence of Stephen Aylmer; she saw her sink lowly, on bended knee, before
    him, and press her lips with a beautiful respect,—a<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7184-218"/> deep, pitying love,—to the feet of the wretched,
    unsightly cripple, and then she closed the door, for she felt it was a scene far
    too sacred to be profaned by human eyes.</p>
<p>As usual Stephen Aylmer made no answer when Mrs. Hartley told him he was to be
    waited on by another attendant,—it was to him, like everything else, a matter of
    perfect indifference; and Millicent at once quietly entered on the post, full of
    labour and suffering, which she would not have exchanged for a royal throne. She
    was careful at first not to let him hear the sound of her voice, but it was soon
    evident, as the days passed on, that he was beginning to observe, and to be
    pleased with, the unspeakable tenderness of the care she bestowed on him,—it was
    impossible indeed but that the atmosphere of love with which she surrounded him,
    should fail to penetrate even unto his soul.</p>
<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7184-219"/>
<p>Gradually he began to show by his movements, and the faint smile which passed
    over his face when her light step sounded near, how soothing and sweet to him
    her presence was; it was plain he loved to feel her soft, cool hand resting, as
    often it did, for hours together, on his burning forehead, and to know that her
    ever‐watchful devotion was around him; but as yet he had never opened his
    lips.</p>
<p>At length one day she ventured to read to him,—it was the only service his
    attendants could render him, which always appeared to give him pleasure,—it
    drove away for the time the dark thoughts which well nigh maddened him, and as
    Mrs. Hartley’s advanced age rendered her incapable of performing it, Millicent
    was the more anxious to ascertain that she might so do without risk of his
    discovering her. At the first sound of her voice he started violently, but the
    very sight of this emotion<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7184-220"/> on his part, only
    made herself the more agitated, and in the low, indistinct tones with which she
    continued to read, it did indeed seem impossible that he should recognise the
    sweet, clear voice with which of old she used to greet him. It was evident that
    he did become reassured, and remained listening with quiet enjoyment to her
    reading; not only it seemed to be like a soothing melody to his restless and
    wearied soul, but there was apparently something in the soft tremulousness of
    that voice, so full of the deep love she bore him, which moved him greatly, for
    when she had concluded, he suddenly broke the sullen, stern silence of many
    months, and said to her—</p>
<p>“I thank you very much,—I hope you will never leave me.”</p>
<p>Oh the tide of wild emotion that came gushing through her breast, as she thus
    heard again the voice for which she had<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7184-221"/>
    hungered and thirsted so long! she could not remain in the room, but fled away,
    to give free vent to her agitation, by a happiness to which her poor desolate
    heart was now so little accustomed,—for not only she had heard his voice, but
    she had heard it addressing herself, in accents of kindness.</p>
<p>From that day she read to him constantly, and was with him always. He spoke to
    her, but to her only, and that sparingly,—whenever any one else was in the room
    he was invariably silent. He became impatient of any attention but hers, and
    openly manifested the pleasure he had in her society.</p>
<p>No words can ever tell the intense joy all this was to Millicent Grey; it was
    greater even, perhaps, than in the days when she had been his prosperous bride,
    for then she had not felt that wearing sorrow which so enhances a return of
    happiness; and now, too, she felt that the joy, mournful as it<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7184-222"/> would have seemed to any other, which she experienced
    in ministering to him in his helpless state, was far more secure than the
    rapturous delight of brighter times, for the frightful infirmities which had cut
    him off from his former friends, and from the very world itself, had shut her
    in, as it were, with him, into his dark solitude, and delivered him up, by all
    others deserted, to her faithful care alone.</p>
<p>But soon, to her unspeakable delight, his health began to improve greatly under
    her unremitting care. He was able at last to walk a few steps through the room,
    leaning on her arm; both Millicent and Mrs. Hartley soon became aware that this
    physical improvement, was chiefly the result of some change which was taking
    place in his mind; an ingredient strangely like the sweet leaven of hope, was
    plainly working in the spirit long so dead and heavy.—Hope! but of what? It was
    not till<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7184-223"/> Millicent had been with him two or
    three months, that the presence of this, our angel of mercy, in his soul, became
    apparent, and with it his whole manner and appearance altered. Millicent had
    taken the name of Mary, by which he always called her; and once when he
    questioned Mrs. Hartley respecting her, wishing to know who she was, and whence
    she came, she had so resolutely abstained from giving him any information
    whatever, and had so calmly answered, that she was merely a person whom she had
    provided to wait upon him, that they were convinced no outward circumstance
    could in any way arouse his suspicions.</p>
<p>Yet that they were aroused in some way was plain; the intense happiness it
    evidently was to him to have her near him; the eagerness with which he listened
    for her step; the mournful impatience which tormented him in her brief absence;
        and<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7184-224"/> above all, the peculiarly meaning
    smile, that often brightened on his countenance, when he heard the tones of her
    voice, all showed abundantly that some strange idea was working in his mind
    respecting her.</p>
<p>As these facts became day by day more evident, there was a deep, fluttering
    delight which stole into the heart of Millicent Grey, and there abode, making
    her often faint with excess of happiness; for if he suspected the truth, as both
    she and Mrs. Hartley were inclined to believe, if he had divined who she was,
    the discovery, beyond a doubt, had been one of rapturous pleasure to him. Oh, if
    it were so, how was her deep, patient love rewarded! What better, higher
    glory,—what dearer joy did she ask for life, than to be allowed thus to watch
    over him in his helplessness until her dying hour. And to do so not in secret,
    but with his own glad permission, were to make for her this mortal existence a
    very vision of delight.</p>
<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7184-225"/>
<p>But that even the hope, the sweet belief in the possibility of such happiness,
    was too inexpressibly dear to be lightly risked, she would already have made her
    happy confession to him, and learnt whether, in truth, her bright dream was to
    be realized.</p>
<p>Besides, Mrs. Hartley counseled her to wait with patience till Aylmer should
    himself explain what he really thought. When she remembered the passionate agony
    of the tone in which he had uttered the first word after his accident, Juliet’s
    name, she felt doubtful of any such sudden revulsion of feeling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, most restless and most miserable was Arthur Egerton, haunted by the
    unhappy love on which he had staked, and as it seemed, lost his life, even as a
    man is pursued by the spirit of one he has murdered. Day and night, day and
    night wearily pondering, dreaming hopelessly, he wandered on the mountains which
        surrounded<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7184-226"/> Millicent’s dwelling; he had
    followed her to Switzerland, and she knew it. At times he came to the châlet,
    but he could not remain long, all he saw and heard there was too insupportable
    to him; and Mrs. Hartley was always terrified lest the sound of his voice should
    reach Aylmer’s ear, as she knew that the vicinity of Arthur would soon have
    betrayed Millicent’s presence to him.</p>
<p>It was inconceivable what this unhappy man suffered at sight of her devotion to
    Aylmer, it drove him well‐nigh frantic with rage. What! was his true,
    unchanging, fervent attachment, to be treated with scorn and indifference,
    whilst the man who had crushed her with his base desertion, who even now,
    perhaps, loved another but too fondly, was to receive unknowing the outpouring
    of her whole soul’s deep tenderness, the offering of her very life! Stephen
    Aylmer and he were more than equals now,<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7184-227"/>
    infinitely more frightful than his repulsive countenance or ungainly figure was
    the poor crippled man’s appearance. And the deadly hate that swelled up in
    Arthur’s heart towards Aylmer, had a terrible power in goading him to a
    recklessness of evil, which a short time since would have appalled himself; he
    was not, however, in any degree quiescent in this state of unholy anguish. Day
    by day more deeply he swore that, living or dying, Millicent Grey should yet be
    his,—or, at least, that she should never be Stephen Aylmer’s.</p>

<head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
<p><hi>SOME</hi> weeks had passed while matters continued in this state, when
    Millicent on entering Aylmer’s room one day found him in evident agitation. She
    herself had prepared to come to him with a trembling anxiety, for they had
    parted the evening before, after a conversation which had filled her with
    mingled terror and hope. His health and spirits had continued to improve
    manifestly, under the influence of her presence, and not of her presence only,
    but of some secret and sweet belief connected with<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7184-229"/> her; he could not have failed to discern from the
    first moment of her attendance on him, that hers was a service of love, and it
    was very plain that he had not only pondered much, from <emph>whom</emph> such a
    devotion of affection could have come, but that he had arrived at a decided
    opinion on the matter.</p>
<p>This decision, whatever it might be, was one full of rapturous joy to him, as
    every word and movement indicated when Millicent Grey was near him; but latterly
    he had shown an impatience of the silence she still maintained, which proved to
    them all, that concealment would soon be impossible.</p>
<p>The night before he began to talk to her of Rookcliffe, and she saw by the manner
    in which he turned his head towards her, and the eager, watchful expression of
    his face, that he had chosen this subject solely in order to discover by the
    tone of her answer, whether it caused her any agitation;<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7184-230"/> he had reason to be abundantly satisfied, for her
    voice shook, so that she could scarcely speak, and he almost felt in the
    vibrating air the trembling of her frame as she stood beside him.</p>
<p>A sudden terror had taken possession of her—she saw that he was about to speak
    again, and she doubted not it would be to demand the truth from her, and she had
    hurried away to prevent it, for full of hope as she was, that he had long since
    guessed the real state of the case, and had proved by his evident happiness, how
    utterly her deep love and faithfulness had prevailed at last over his wayward
    heart,—yet this summer‐time of hope had been so inexpressibly sweet to her, that
    she dreaded any change, even were it to richer blessings; she had known too much
    of misery—sudden, blighting misery, not to cling to the present joy with a
    shrinking dread of aught that could vary it in any way. She saw at a glance,<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7184-231"/> however, on entering the room next morning,
    that this hour was to be decisive; the manner in which he took her hand on her
    entrance, and held it with a grasp from which she could not escape, showed that
    he was resolved that she should not leave him without an explanation.</p>
<p>Millicent sat down on a low seat by his side—her accustomed place, and the
    sightless eyes turned to her with an almost frightful anxiety, as though the
    frantic desire of the soul could enable it even yet to look through those
    darkened cavities. Meanwhile the grasp tightened on her hand; he spoke at last,
    his voice was low and tremulous.</p>
<p>“I have been so longing for you, my light, my joy!”</p>
<p>She started; he had never called her by such terms before:—he went on:</p>
<p>“I shall never call you Mary again, it is a false title; you have a dearer name
        for<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7184-232"/> me, my earthly guardian angel.” Her
    heart throbbed so violently that she could scarce remain tranquil, but his
    strong hand closed on hers and seemed to control her; she listened now to what
    he said, entranced as when in dreams we hear a sweet unearthly music.</p>
<p>“Listen, gentlest and tenderest of friends,” continued Aylmer. “I long to tell
    you all that has been wandering through my heart this many a day, breathing, as
    it were, new life within it. When you came to me,—a vision of sweetest mercy, I
    was plunged in a despair for which earth has no parallel; my longing eyes were
    shut up from the light of day—deprived for ever of their rapturous delight in
    beauty, and my pining soul was exiled from the light of life, deprived for ever
    of its intense enjoyment in that love which is the moral beauty of this world.
    When you came with that soft tender hand, that sweet voice, whose faintest tone
    breathed volumes of affection, which it was unutterable<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7184-233"/> joy to me to hear; then light and beauty both
    returned to my soul, for they were in the devoted, disinterested love I felt you
    gave me. I knew, however, that it was no stranger love which was around me,
    brightening every moment more and more the blackness of darkness to which the
    wrath of heaven had consigned me! Had it been,—(a thing incredible indeed!) some
    really new affection roused by pity for me, it had but added a thousand‐fold to
    my great torment; for what to me were the love in which I could not share, for
    which I felt no shadow of a wish? valueless indeed, as is that sunshine now, on
    which I cannot gaze, were the attachment in which I could feel no sympathy! But
    I knew it was not so—with the very first sound of your voice there sprung into
    my soul a hope brighter, dearer, more glorious, than any which ever shone upon
    my days of pride—the hope, that one who loved me when we were in some sense
    equals, now with a beautiful generosity, a<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7184-234"/>
    faithfulness worthy to be crowned with noblest honour, had returned to the poor,
    wretched, helpless cripple in his deep adversity, and sacrificed to him the
    priceless treasure of her heart and life,—freely as though he were not a very
    pauper in this world, more abject, more degraded, more utterly stripped of all
    earthly good than the starving beggar who can see the sun!”</p>
<p>“Sweet angel, as this hope brightened in my heart, no words can ever tell the
    tide of matchless joy that gushed in with it; I felt, and I feel now, that
    almost would I gladly sacrifice the sight of these blind eyes again, to have so
    glorious, so unexampled a proof of that love which alone is precious to me on
    this earth.”</p>
<p>“So very sweet that hope, I could not bear to change it even for a more blessed
    assurance—but I have lived in your presence, happy,—as in the days of light and
    joy—feeling that hour by hour, with your<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7184-235"/> most
    tender care and most devoted watchfulness, you were twining yourself around my
    heart with a power which you never possessed, even when I could claim you as my
    promised bride. Dearer grew life, yes, even to the blind cripple how intensely
    dear! Fender, holier, brighter grew your image in my soul, till I felt that
    ample was the compensation for all that had been taken from me, in the gift my
    very infirmities had procured me—of a love which could not otherwise have
    existed in its utter unselfishness and generosity. I never thought you could be
    to me, what you have been these last few months. I never thought in my time of
    triumph, to feel for you the intensity of tenderness which now absorbs me;
    therefore have you made my suffering truly a most blessed thing.”</p>
<p>“But now I can no longer be content with but the hope, however firm, I must have
    the certainty—that certainty which shall make the blind man’s darkened life, far
        brighter<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7184-236"/> than that of any who look upon
    the light of heaven—that certainty without which I must even die! for I can
    truly feel that my existence now is literally bound up in you. Speak, then, you
    who are my life, say that I am right, that you are—Juliet!”</p>
<p><emph rend="sc">JULIET</emph>!—those few minutes when Millicent Grey sat with her
    hand in Stephen Aylmer’s, listening to those words of his which we have just
    recorded, had been the happiest of her life—and that happiness had been of a
    nature which it is rarely given to mortals to enjoy on this side heaven—for she
    had firmly believed that he was speaking throughout of herself. She imagined him
    to be fully aware of Juliet’s marriage (which had, in fact, been concealed from
    him), and therefore it never occurred to her that he could have so far deceived
    himself, as to have mistaken her for her cousin. She had sat there hearing him
    speak of his perfect happiness, to gain<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7184-237"/> which
    she had so toiled—a fearful, painful toil—and hearing him say that he had
    obtained it by the very means which was to secure her own—instead of his life
    being made blessed only by the utter cursing of hers—and it had seemed to her
    while he spoke that mercy had been at last extended to her, and that her great
    prayer, into which her whole existence had been embodied for his well‐being on
    earth, had been granted in such a way as to secure a bright joy for herself.</p>
<p>She thought that her long sore trial was ended—that she who had been so tossed on
    the deep waters of despair, so driven to and fro by storms of misery, so chilled
    to the very soul by biting blasts of human cruelty, was about to enter on her
    rest at last—and that even she had reason to rejoice in all that had occurred,
    since it had wrought for her a far more perfect joy—for he who had coldly loved
    her formerly, already spoke of the intensity of tender‐<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7184-238"/> ness her deep devotion had called forth. And now into
    the very ocean of calm and exquisite enjoyment in which her soul had floated
    while he spoke, there came breathing in the name of Juliet—that word of fearful
    import! even as the cry of “fire” sounds in the startled mariner’s ears when the
    summer’s seas are all tranquillity, and tells him that destruction is come upon
    him, and he is about to perish for ever in the remorseless deep. She fell back,
    stricken down by that name, almost as he had been by the thunder‐bolt, and by
    that movement, plucked her hand from his grasp with sudden violence.</p>
<p>Aylmer was startled, almost terrified—he raised himself on his elbow, and it was
    sad to see the intense anxiety with which the force of habit sent the poor
    sightless eyes wandering in search of her.</p>
<p>“Where are you?” he said, with a mournful cry. “What can have happened? Why will
    you not speak? Think, think how my<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7184-239"/> life is
    depending on your answer; it cannot be that I was mistaken—oh, it cannot be that
    such anguish is preparing for me, such a dawn of hope to fade into so black a
    night—but no, no—it is only that you are agitated, and so cannot speak. I can
    hear your heart beating, I know that it is so, and I know you are my own, my own
    Juliet. I could not mistake that dear voice, so sweetly familiar.”</p>
<p>She shuddered violently—that fatal resemblance of voice, once before had cost her
    agony—but now! Still she was silent, but for the convulsive drawing of her
    breath, which he heard distinctly—the paleness of a deadly alarm spread over his
    face—he stretched out his shaking hands, groping frantically in his great
    darkness. At last he touched her; then he seized her by the arm; he dragged her
    close to him; he passed his hand over her head and face—“Speak, speak!” he said,
    in a hoarse whisper.<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7184-240"/> “Do you know what you are
    doing? Do you know that you are killing, me? If you are not Juliet Egerton, if
    you are not <emph rend="sc">MY</emph> Juliet, the beloved of my heart, the light
    of my soul—the joy, the hope, the charm of my life—I swear to you that I will
    not live—I <emph>will not</emph>! to be so wretched, so accursed a thing—blind,
    baffled, miserable!” He almost shouted the last word, and it roused her from her
    extreme agony to feel that she must think—that she must decide what was to be
    done in this horrible emergency; and again towering over the soul of Millicent
    Grey, over her passion of distress, her almost delirium of suffering, there rose
    the one desire, which had been the abiding principle of her existence, since
    first she had looked on Stephen Aylmer—the desire for his happiness—this arose
    predominant over all‐his words rung in her ears,—he would not live to endure the
    misery of knowing he had been mistaken. She compared this with his<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7184-241"/> glad outpouring of joy a few minutes before. He
        <emph>had</emph> been happy—how happy in the belief that she was Juliet; and
    now, what a prospect of intolerable desolation was before him. And wherefore
    should he endure it? Why should her revelation bring it darkly upon him? He had
    been most unspeakably blest in a delusion—why should not the delusion
    continue?—for months he had believed that Juliet was with him—why should he not
    believe it, and rejoice in the thought to his dying hour? What should prevent it
    but her own want of courage, of devotion, of faithfulness, to perform so fearful
    a penance, as thus to personate for him the rival he loved?</p>
<p>Millicent never thought of the falsehood such a plan must involve. Those who
    worship their idols of flesh, soon forget the pure laws of a holier faith.</p>
<p>She thought only that she had consecrated herself to his happiness, and again<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7184-242"/> by martyrdom was she condemned to obtain
    it.</p>
<p>There was no time for delay; the clinging hands were tightening frantically upon
    her arm—the countenance of Aylmer was distorted with the most fearful
    emotions.</p>
<p>She bowed her head, her spirit resigned itself—it delivered up its hope and its
    joy as a man gives up life, and the breath on his lips. She accepted her
    penance.</p>
<p>She pressed her lips to his hands that were cruelly crushing her own, and
    whispered “I am her, indeed, who has loved you so well.”</p>
<p>How bitterly, long after, did she rue that perjury! but she thought not then of
    the crime, remembering only that she was to be the instrument of his peace, by
    what means soever that peace might be effected.</p>
<p>And he, the full tide of joy rushing back to his heart, assured that she was
    Juliet indeed, how he tortured her soul with his<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7184-243"/> wild cry of delight,—how he caused her whole frame to shiver, in the horrible
    mockery of the embrace bestowed on her for the sake of another. She endured it
    for a while—then life seemed passing away altogether, and she said,—“I am
    faint—let me go—I will return.”</p>
<p>And he released her. He thought in truth such joy was bewildering. She crept away
    lost, hopeless, and in torture. Yet even then her thought was for him; she must
    take care that no other took from him the joy she had given—fearful the cost,
    and secure must the recompense be.</p>
<p>She went to Mrs. Hartley, she told her all—she besought her not to destroy the
    poor blind man’s delusion. She said it was done,—it must be so,—that her task
    was appointed now to the end of her days,—the, daily, hourly agony of receiving
    his love for another. She said that his happiness was her own right, her charge,
    her care, and<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7184-244"/> none must dare tamper with
    it—had she not bought it with suffering such as human words could not reveal?
    Mrs. Hartley hesitated long; she felt it was wrong to permit a deceit, but she
    was a woman, and weak,—her heart was wrung by the pleading of the desolate being
    now sobbing before her. She said she would not affirm a falsehood, but she would
    not undeceive him.</p>
<p>Millicent thanked her for this permission to live a life of inconceivable
    anguish, as though for the highest boon; and Mrs. Hartley ever dreading to
    interfere in so dark and fearful a history, added in sorrowing accents,—“My
    child, I fear you have taken to yourself a torture you will find
    insupportable.”</p>
            </div>
            <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7184-245"/>
            <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER X.</head>
<p><hi>AND</hi> Mrs. Hartley was right; there was a torture beyond the power of
    language to express, in the life Millicent Grey had chosen to herself, yet not
    insupportable, nothing is insupportable to that love which alone deserves the
    name, a love free from the least taint of selfishness. Willingly she had
    accepted the sacrifice—willingly she performed it; but it was not as formerly,
    one sharp fierce trial, one convulsive effort, and then the calm of inaction; it
    was now the renewed and continued struggle of every<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7184-246"/> moment, the fresh wound of each hour, the daily
    offering up of self, with a bleeding and a broken heart.</p>
<p>The very excess of her suffering was in some sense sweet, because all was endured
    for <emph>him</emph>, but it was in truth a very fearful penance, to sit day
    after day by his side, and hear him give her every name of the softest
    endearment, every assurance of that affection which alone could have been her
    life’s sunshine and to know it was all designed for another! to feel the loving
    grasp of his hand, and tremble to think how with that hand, he would have driven
    her from him, had he known the truth;—to hear him delight himself in giving her
    all the torturing details of his intense love for her cousin, from the very
    first hour he had seen her,—to listen to his declaration of exquisite
    unutterable happiness in the belief that Juliet was near him, whose presence
    alone he desired in this world.</p>
<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7184-247"/>
<p>Then, often, he would speak of Millicent herself, as of one whom he had never
    really loved, but sought only to marry for his uncle’s pleasure; and who,
    because of her indifference, or perhaps for the sake of Arthur Egerton, had been
    so ready to give him up: he said that her coldness of heart was plainly proved,
    since she had never so much as inquired after him since his fearful accident;
    how different from his beautiful, his beloved Juliet, whose unexampled devotion
    was lovely as her own sweet face,— whose pure generous soul shared the beauty of
    her outward appearance! how thankful he was that he had been saved from wedding
    Millicent Grey. He shuddered to think on the anguish he would have suffered had
    he seen Juliet Egerton, when already the husband of one he must have learnt to
    hate.</p>
<p>Poor Millicent wept very sore when he spoke thus, and if he felt her cold
        cheek<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7184-248"/> wet with tears, he took it as
    another proof of Juliet’s feeling heart, and lavished on her thanks and praises
    that were but too torturing. It might have seemed that the woman’s pride within
    her, would have revolted against such treatment, but pride could have no place
    in presence of such frightful infirmities as those which were laid on Stephen
    Aylmer;—her deep humility of devotion could never be degrading, when offered to
    so miserable, so unsightly an object of compassion as he had become.</p>
<p>In the deceit she was now practicing, Millicent Grey had made that fatal mistake,
    that subtle but most unrighteous error, which supposes that self‐sacrifice or a
    noble generous aim can <emph>sanctify a falsehood</emph>. Many crimes have been
    committed, not of falsehood only, but of deeper dye, by means of this fallacy,
    so inviting to ardent and misguided minds.</p>
<p>But Millicent soon found, as must ever be<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7184-249"/> the
    case with any deviation from truth, that she had involved herself in a labyrinth
    of difficulty. Aylmer had constantly asked her to assure him again and again,
    that she had told him only what was her determined resolution, when she had
    promised to devote her life to him, and this she could with all truth affirm,
    for she did love, and designed to live, in and for him only.</p>
<p>Gradually he made it manifest for what purpose he had sought this assurance; he
    said if it were so, if really he was to be so unspeakably blest as that she
    should never quit him more, she must take the sanction of his name, she must
    assume the title that once had been so nearly hers, and become his wife.</p>
<p>It may be imagined what terror there was in this proposal to the wretched
    Millicent; it was utterly impossible to carry the deceit so far as to let him
    marry her under his present delusion, and yet it was<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7184-250"/> both difficult and bitterly painful to refuse him;
    for whilst in her own rightful person she would have been too thankful to have
    thus bound herself more irrevocably to the care of his existence, in her strange
    and peculiar position he could only attribute her hesitation to a repugnance
    against a marriage with one so unfortunate; thus believing her withheld by the
    very infirmities and helplessness, which would have drawn her in actual fact
    more closely to him.</p>
<p>Aylmer did not reproach her for her refusal, but she saw that he felt it deeply,
    and this cut her to the very heart.</p>
<p>Still, the days and weeks, and even months went on, whilst they continued to lead
    this painful and unnatural existence; but Millicent little thought the while how
    the very ground beneath her feet was being undermined.</p>
<p>It will not be supposed that Arthur<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7184-251"/> Egerton,
    with his fierce will, and subtle mind, could remain inactive or content with an
    arrangement which rendered Stephen Aylmer perfectly happy in the entire
    enjoyment of Millicent’s society, and bound herself to him as with an
    indissoluble tie. From the first moment when Arthur heard of the extraordinary
    system of deception into which Millicent had been drawn unawares, be saw therein
    a bright hope for himself.</p>
<p>Knowing Stephen Aylmer to be thoroughly convinced that it was indeed Juliet, the
    only being he had ever really loved, who was giving him hourly proofs of such
    unequaled affection, Arthur felt certain that the disappointment, if ever he
    discovered his mistake, would be so terrible and so bitter, that the angry man
    would not scruple to cast off poor Millicent for ever.</p>
<p>Ungoverned passion is a fearful thing, and Arthur knew its power too well in his
    own soul, not to judge accurately enough of<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7184-252"/>
    its effect in others; he had never yet been allowed to see Aylmer, but he heard
    enough in his visits to Mrs. Hartley, to show him that the blind man was
    becoming day by day more absorbed in the happiness which he believed he derived,
    from the presence and the affection of Juliet only—so that to find how, in
    actual fact, she was far distant from him, would be to plunge him in a despair
    over which the unhappy Millicent could have no power. Arthur’s great object,
    therefore, was to undeceive the blind man as soon as might be. Strange! to think
    that to this cruel, unrelenting persecution of one most unfortunate, he should
    have given the holy name of love! He would have dealt more tenderly by Millicent
    Grey, had he long since driven a knife into her heart, than thus by repeated
    blows to pierce her, ever living, to its very core.</p>
<p>He found it by no means an easy matter to effect his purpose. Millicent had
        pre‐<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7184-253"/> vented him even seeing Aylmer, lest
    some unguarded word from him should betray the truth; and although he was fully
    determined to steal into his presence whenever he had an opportunity of doing so
    unobserved; yet as Mrs. Hartley or herself were always with him, this was not
    soon accomplished.</p>
<p>One day, however, when some months had elapsed, in which the blind man had lived
    most happy in his sweet delusion, Arthur Egerton found means to penetrate into
    his appartment. Mrs. Hartly had gone out—and he had by a stratagem succeeded in
    having Millicent sent for to speak to some person on business in another part of
    the house.</p>
<p>Then he stole like a stealthy serpent into the blind man’s room.</p>
<p>For a moment Arthur Egerton stood appalled at the sight he saw—he remembered so
    well the pride, and the beauty, and<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7184-254"/> the
    strength of that deformed repulsive‐looking being. Yet, with that wreck of
    humanity before him, telling of what elements this life’s treasures are
    composed, he went on, preparing to devote, and, perhaps unawares to sacrifice
    altogether, his deathless soul for the attainment of an earthly good.
    Remembering he had no time to lose, he went up and took Aylmer by the hand.</p>
<p>He asked him if he recollected him, and inquired, with much apparent kindness,
    respecting the state of his health.</p>
<p>“Arthur Egerton, is it not?” exclaimed Aylmer. “I recognised your voice; I have
    been wishing much that some of Juliet’s family should visit us; I am very glad
    you are come.”</p>
<p>Arthur was delighted to hear him in his very sentence introduce the subject on
    which he wished to speak. It was necessary that he should give his information
    speedily, as Millicent was certain to return soon.</p>
<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7184-255"/>
<p>“I am truly happy to see you, my dear Aylmer,” he replied; “I fear, however, I
    can give you no news of Juliet which will be agreeable to you.”</p>
<p>“News of Juliet!” exclaimed Aylmer. “Arthur, what can you mean? how should I
    require news of her when she is with me every hour of the day?”</p>
<p>“Juliet with you?” replied Arthur, throwing into his voice a well‐feigned
    expression of surprise; “you must be labouring under some extraordinary mistake.
    My sister is not here, I can assure you.”</p>
<p>“That is, you are not aware of it; you are but just arrived, and it is plain she
    has concealed from you that she has been with us these many months; but it is
    best there should be no such mysteries. I will persuade her to see you, and tell
    you all the truth to‐day.”</p>
<p>“Aylmer,” said Arthur, with great decision and solemnity, “I know not what<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7184-256"/> motive they have for thus grossly deceiving
    you, but I give you my word of honour that Juliet Egerton is not and never has
    been here; she is in Italy, where I saw her not long since, and whence I
    received a letter from her this morning; I can read it to you if you like, as a
    proof that I tell the plain truth.”</p>
<p>He was careful not to tell she was married; it might have induced Aylmer more
    readily to forgive poor Millicent. An expression of the wildest agitation had
    passed over the face of the blind man; he started up, the darkened eyes staring
    wide open.</p>
<p>“In the name of mercy, what is it you say?” he exclaimed; “am I to doubt the
    evidence of my own senses? it is not half an hour since Juliet left the
    room—”</p>
<p>“Aylmer, I grieve to remind you of it; but you must remember that you are
    deprived of the use of that sense which could alone enable you to ascertain the
    truth on<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7184-257"/> this point. I repeat to you, and
    indeed it were best for you to receive the fact, however painful—you are
    deceived, cruelly deceived—Juliet has never been here.”</p>
<p>“But I know her voice—the touch of her hand, Arthur; I tell you she has been at
    my side for hours, and answered even to that name.”</p>
<p>“There is often a strange resemblance in voices, and where there is the
    premeditated resolution to mislead one blind as you are, it is not a difficult
    matter; but it is needless for you to argue the point any further with me. I
    tell you I have been here for months, and constantly in this house, only they
    would not let me see you, lest I should act a friend’s part by you, and
    undeceive you. I have watched the person who represents Juliet for you; I know
    who she is, for I have seen her face day by day, though you could not.”</p>
<p>There was an evident truthfulness in this<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7184-258"/> last
    speech of Arthur’s, which suddenly carried complete conviction to the mind of
    Aylmer. He no longer doubted that it was even so—that he had been utterly
    deceived, and that all the intense, most exquisite happiness he had enjoyed in
    the society of her he believed to be his Juliet, his living ideal of glorious
    beauty, was in truth but a false and bitter mockery. If a man, by a single word,
    could suddenly call up the whirlwind out of a summer sky, and were unexpectedly
    to see the raging tempest springing up at his own unguarded wish, he could not
    be more utterly appalled than was Arthur Egerton, when he saw the horrible
    expression of frantic rage, that now distorted the features of the unhappy
    Aylmer.</p>
<p>All that had been deepest joy to him, in the delusion thus rudely destroyed, all
    that was horror, darkness, and despair in the prospect of his life without it,
    had gathered<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7184-259"/> itself up into one fierce passion
    of unrestrained tremendous anger against her who had practised this deceit upon
    him. He had ever been of fiery temper, he could ill brook contradiction even in
    his best days,—and now to find that advantage had been taken of his very
    infirmity to mislead him, and prepare for him an agony of disappointment,
    against which his whole soul revolted, as the body would shrink from the rack
    itself,—was so maddening a discovery, that it flung him into a convulsion of
    rage, full of the one wild desire to wreak his vengeance on the false Juliet who
    had betrayed him. The violence of his passion impeded his speech for a few
    minutes; then his countenance became livid with its excess, and he burst out in
    a tone that almost struck terror to the heart even of the strong man before
    him—</p>
<p>“Who is she then, where is she, who has dared to deceive me, that base, most
        treach‐<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7184-260"/> erous, being—who is she, that I
    may know whom to hate, with all the power of the false love I felt for her,
    turned now to deadliest poison?”</p>
<p>“She is here to speak for herself,” muttered Arthur, shaking from head to foot,
    as he suddenly perceived that Millicent had entered unperceived, and was
    standing close to the blind man, with her horror‐dilated eyes fixed full on his
    face. She had heard Aylmer’s terrible speech.</p>
<p>“Here!” he exclaimed, and stretched out his hand; it fell on the shoulder of
    Millicent, and closed on it with a grasp fierce and cruel as that of a tiger. He
    dragged her to him with such violence that she fell to the ground; then he
    shouted in her ear with a voice more awful to her than the thunders in their
    wrath, “Who are you—what are you—impostor, deceiver—that have dared to betray
    the blind man? Vile hypocrite, creeping here with your soft<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7184-261"/> lying words, to steal my heart’s love on such false
    pretences. Speak, is it true, has he spoken the truth?—which of you has lied to
    bring a curse on your heads, for baffling the blind?—are you not Juliet Egerton,
    my only beloved?”</p>
<p>“Forgive, forgive,” gasped Millicent, in convulsions of anguish and fear.</p>
<p>“Forgive! is there ever forgiveness for a deed like this? I will know who you
    are, most wretched impostor; speak at once—lest in my fury I take from you the
    power of speaking for ever—who are you?”</p>
<p>“Millicent!” She felt as if her heart’s blood gushed out with that name.</p>
<p>“Millicent!” It seemed as though a lingering of hope had remained for him till
    that word was spoken; and now all was blackness in the spirit, where hope and
    joy reigned so brightly before.</p>
<p>With all the force of his strong hand he flung her away, as a thing too worthless
        to<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7184-262"/> claim another thought, and then bowing
    his face on his hands, he gave way to irrepressible sorrow, crying out for
    Juliet, Juliet —his own, his only love—beseeching her to come, wafting and
    lamenting in uttermost desolation. Millicent had gone reeling from his heavy
    hand till she fell against the wall, and sunk to the ground stunned and bruised
    with the blow; but that voice, the fatal name of Juliet breathed in such accents
    of mournful tenderness, recalled her to the bitterness of life. She could no
    more endure those sounds, than a criminal on the scaffold could have borne the
    insults of the exulting people. She rose and staggered out; as she passed
    Arthur, she turned her wan face, where the prayer for death was written in
    legible characters, and cast on him one look of gentlest, most touching
    reproach—</p>
<p>That look was with him to his dying day; and years after, when he was sinking in
        his<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7184-263"/> mortal sickness, he told one who
    watched by him, that he believed that white face, with its pale dumb lips, and
    awfully eloquent eyes, would look at him through the coffin lid. So Millicent
    Grey wandered away from the house, no one knew whither, and Arthur Egerton, who
    saw not which way she went, fled in the opposite direction, appalled and yet
    exulting at all he had done.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
<p><hi>WHEN</hi> Mrs. Hartley returned she found only Stephen Aylmer within the
    house, in a state of mind which baffled all description. She guessed what
    happened, but he told her all in detail; and his fury returning as he thought
    how bright had been the dream, how bitter the waking, he repeated the cruel
    words he had used to the wretched Millicent.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley could scarcely contain her indignation, when she heard how he had
    treated that generous faithful friend. Poor<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7184-265"/>
    Millicent had erred certainly in departing from the truth, but was
        <emph>he</emph> the one to punish her so fiercely for the error that had
    sprung out of the patient love he inspired? His aunt saw it was time he should
    learn to know the value of that true heart’s rare and devoted affection, and
    that the mask should be stripped from the false worldly being he worshipped so
    madly.</p>
<p>With a tone of solemnity which forcibly arrested his attention, she told him to
    compose himself, and listen to the truth of his own life, which had been since
    the hour he met Juliet Egerton presented to him in such false colours, that he
    had fallen into those grievous errors, whereby he had utterly destroyed his own
    peace and that of others.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley knew Juliet’s real character most thoroughly,—one of her own married
    daughters had known both her, and the Marchesa with whom she had lived at Milan
    very intimately, and had detailed to her<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7184-266"/>
    mother the whole circumstances of Juliet’s conduct there, which was in no case
    at all favourable to her. This lady had also fortunately a full acquaintance
    with all the particulars of her first conversation with Aylmer, as the Marchesa
    who was her rival in reality, though her friend in name, had not scrupled, after
    Miss Egerton’s departure for England, to tell all who cared to know, the history
    of that deep‐laid scheme, to entrap by a little artful mystery, the inaccessible
    Englishman, supposed heir to so immense a fortune. When Mrs. Hartley wrote,
    therefore, asking the real facts of this mysterious acquaintance of Aylmer and
    Juliet, from which they assumed a right to act in so strange a manner at
    Rookcliffe,—her daughter was able to give her a faithful account of it, with a
    deep insight into Juliet’s subtle mind and hateful character.</p>
<p>And now Mrs. Hartley began from the very commencement, and detailed all this
        to<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7184-267"/> Aylmer. She cared not what pain it cost
    him. Truth, and truth alone, must be sought for now. She displayed to him with a
    clearness which he could not misdoubt, the vile calculations which had induced
    Juliet to detach him from Millicent,—she showed beyond the possibility of
    mistake, that there had not been a gleam of love in that false heart for him,
    and she contrasted that coldness veiled in a hideous mockery of affection with
    the very ocean of pure deep tenderness, which Millicent Grey had once devoted to
    him, and never recalled. He had not understood it, even in the days when he was
    prepared to marry her, because in truth it was too sacred, too intense and
    adoring a feeling to be displayed, even to his own gaze; but Mrs. Hartley told
    him now, of all that true heart suffered,—how often she had come to her fainting
    with sorrow, and how the principle she had set before herself, as the object of
    her being, was only to labour and toil for his happiness.</p>
<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7184-268"/>
<p>She described what that toil had been, racking her soul as the limbs of the poor
    slave are racked at his work, and how up to this hour in desolation and
    faintness, poor Millicent wrought still, to accomplish this end.</p>
<p>She explained the history of their parting, telling how Millicent had seen his
    own letter, and straightway for the accomplishment of his peace on earth, (that
    deep desire of her spirit) consented to slay her own hopes and give herself up
    to the worst desolation.</p>
<p>She spoke of her that evening at Milton Lodge, when Aylmer in his delirium of joy
    and Juliet in her insolent triumph, thought nothing of her, who had bought it
    all for them by the death‐like anguish she then was enduring. Mrs. Hartley
    passed on to the time of his accident; she detailed Juliet’s conduct so
    revolting and heartless; and she saw that he writhed under her words,<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7184-269"/> but <emph>she</emph> heeded it not; she went on to
    tell how she who had promised to be his wife for better for worse, had demanded
    at last to see him in his helpless condition alone. Mrs. Hartley said, during
    that interview she had entered the room unperceived, and had seen Juliet
    standing over him, with a countenance where contempt and disgust were struggling
    together. Aylmer uttered a cry of torture at these words, yet he seemed
    fascinated by her recital, and still she went on: Juliet passed her, she said,
    and went out of the room, disdainfully tossing that beautiful head; she departed
    for Italy, and now she had long been another man’s wife—married!</p>
<p>As this intelligence rang on his ear, Aylmer felt as though the lightning bad
    struck him again—but this blow was <emph>more</emph> fearful than that of the
    thunderbolt, for that had but quenched for him the natural light, and this drove
    his soul into the darkness of night.<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7184-270"/> But still
    the solemn voice went sounding its fearful details, and he seemed compelled to
    listen as to the sentence of fate.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley spoke now of Millicent, of her patient agony in the solitude of her
    home at Aix. It was soothing to Aylmer as a sweet strain of music, to hear of
    such love, when his breast was convulsed with the knowledge of Juliet’s
    defection; it was touching to hear the scene of Millicent’s arrival at the
    châlet, to know with what a beautiful love and respect she knelt down to kiss
    the feet of the blind man in his helplessness. Aylmer knew more truly than Mrs.
    Hartley could tell, how tenderly Millicent had cared for him since then, and how
    the days and the hours had past when she lived but to minister to him; then she
    bid him recall all he said, when he told her he believed she was Juliet, which
    Millicent never suspected, and how not only it seemed that the happiness she
    laboured to gain him<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7184-271"/> would be lost for ever if
    his delusion were destroyed, but that even he affirmed most solemnly, his very
    life must depart, if this sweet dream went from him.</p>
<p>Poor Millicent was but a woman, weak, timid, and trusting; she believed he would
    die, or she believed if he did live, it would be to great misery—there seemed no
    other means of preserving his peace, or gaining his happiness but by this
    continued delusion; she thought only of the bitterness of the trial to herself,
    and not of the error—and precisely because it <emph>was</emph> so bitter,
    because the sacrifice was so fearful, she believed her devoted love was designed
    to accomplish it—and so she had taken upon herself, for his sake, an existence
    of torture. And Aylmer again knew better than all how unrepiningly she performed
    her terrible task—how, without a murmur, she heard his deep words of love for
    another, and listened with only the tears falling silent, to his aspersions on
    her own undying affection,</p>
<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7184-272"/>
<p>“And now, Stephen,” said Mrs. Hartley, as she concluded, “you know and understand
    what has been and is, that love in its most generous tenderness, which this day
    you have punished so heavily.”</p>
<p>Aylmer was deeply moved, but almost too much bewildered, with mingled sorrow and
    remorse to speak or to think. Mrs. Hartley left him; she was anxious to find the
    unhappy Millicent, for she almost believed from his manner she might speak words
    of hope to her—but she sought her in vain, she was not in the house, and no one
    hew where she was. One of the servants had seen her creeping out of the châlet,
    when her ghastly appearance had terrified the woman, who had already been
    alarmed at the sounds of vehement passion which had burst from Aylmer’s room;
    she had watched Millicent wandering away, with feeble and uncertain steps into
    the woods, and then she had seen her no more. Mrs. Hartley became exces‐<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7184-273"/> sively anxious when she heard this account;
    she knew that Millicent must have been in a most fearful state of anguish, and
    she trembled for her reason, or the results of a momentary madness of grief. She
    dispatched the servants in all directions to seek her, and went herself to
    Arthur’s abode, which was not far distant, in the hope that he might have
    followed; <corr>here</corr> but she found him stretched on his sofa in a deep sleep of exhaustion,
    for often he wandered the live‐long night round Millicent’s dwelling, and only
    snatched a few hours of rest by day.</p>
<p>He was startled beyond measure when he heard she had not returned; he himself had
    not seen her since she quitted the house; but full of terror now at thought of
    all that might occur, if with his own hand he had driven her desperate, he
    rushed down into the woods to seek her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley returned in extreme agitation, and along with the servants sought<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7184-274"/> vainly for Millicent till nightfall. It had
    been early morning when she had gone wandering forth in her great
    despair,—driven out by the cruel hand she so often had kissed, and now the
    darkness was come, and where was she seeking her rest that night?</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley sent for a party of peasants, who were to search the woods and drag
    the rivers till morning; whilst she waited their arrival, she went for a few
    minutes to Aylmer, who had sent for her repeatedly.</p>
<p>“What is all this?” he said to her, in a voice full of agitation, “where is
    Millicent?”</p>
<p>“Who can tell,” said Mrs. Hartley, the tears streaming from her eyes as she
    spoke; “perhaps she is resting now, as living she never has rested! My poor
    child, my poor gentle child—it has been a cruel world to her!”</p>
<p>Aylmer shivered in every limb, and the cold dew stood on his forehead.</p>
<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7184-275"/>
<p>“In the name of mercy,” he said, “you do not mean—” his lips refused to
    articulate further.</p>
<p>“I do not know,” replied Mrs. Hartley, “none can know anything as yet, but my
    heart misgives me—death, natural or by the violence of insanity, seems the only
    termination one can imagine to such anguish as hers must have been.” She made no
    attempt to spare the feelings of Aylmer in speaking thus, though she saw he was
    suffering torments; his conduct aggravated in her eyes, by the fatal result she
    dreaded, had seemed to her so heartless and cruel, that she could scarce believe
    him capable of much feeling now, or overcome the indignation she felt.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley was wrong, however, in thinking Aylmer heartless or naturally cruel;
    he was a man of passionate temper, and the violent disappointment he
    experienced, had goaded him into a passing<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7184-276"/>
    madness; but the truth of the whole matter had now risen clear on his soul; he
    saw what Juliet was—he understood what Millicent had been,—if indeed her young
    life had expired in the excess of her sorrow; and the deep, fearful remorse
    which took possession of him, as Mrs. Hartley left him, might truly have
    expiated, in its bitter intensity, the errors he had so carelessly
    committed.</p>
<p>It was a most awful night he passed. All that Millicent had done for him, all her
    precious unexampled love, rose up before him with an agonizing truthfulness of
    detail. Never, never again in this world—he felt it deeply—would he find one to
    love him as she had done! and after all, the being he had so fondly cherished
    for these last six months, because of her tender care, her matchless devotion to
    himself,—the being to whom his desolate heart had clung, as never to Juliet in
    the time of his triumphant happiness, was Millicent in very truth, and not<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7184-277"/> as he had imagined—Juliet, softened and
    ennobled by a generous affection to a poor and helpless cripple. What mattered
    it to the blind man, that the tender guardian of his life and happiness, these
    many months, possessed not the radiant beauty which had charmed the artist’s
    eye, nor bore the name which once for him contained the promise of all earth’s
    joy?</p>
<p>Whoever, whatever she might be that, angel‐like, had tended him with such a
    loving mercy, she was still the friend, who by her disinterested tenderness had
    drawn his very soul towards her in grateful, true affection; he had felt by a
    natural, though mistaken fancy, when he found that as Juliet, she did not exist
    for him, as though he must lose her altogether,—and that the happiness he had
    derived from her society under that name, must utterly pass away, when he was
    told she had no claim to it. He saw now what utter folly his was: the indi‐<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7184-278"/> vidual he had loved, as of necessity, ever
    since she came to him, a living sunbeam in his great darkness, was still the
    same,—and still would have been ready, no doubt, to have blest him with her
    loving care, had he not, (so to speak,) trampled her under his feet, in
    punishment of her very love’s excess.</p>
<p>It is certain that Stephen Aylmer would not so soon have experienced this
    revulsion of feeling, had he not been made aware of Juliet’s real character
    which to him, with his great refinement of mind, was most revolting in its
    peculiar qualities; and likewise a most powerful effect had been produced upon
    him by Mrs. Hartley’s evident conviction, that his harshness had most literally
    broken the heart of the unhappy being, who had sacrificed to him her all of
    life, and died at last as it were at his command.</p>
<p>Stern indeed must be the man who could hear unmoved, that the heart which
        loved<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7184-279"/> him best on earth, is cold in death,
    never more to beat in warm throbbing as it has beat for him; priceless then
    becomes the humble clinging love he lightly held, or carelessly repulsed before.
    Bitter grows his longing, to feel but once again the loving pressure of the
    hand, for ever stiff and lifeless—from which too often his own has been
    withdrawn. And Stephen felt with an intensity of mournful regret, that he would
    have given all on earth to have had once more those gentle arms supporting his
    aching head; he thought with horror unspeakable of the violence he had used to
    that shrinking frame, when he flung her from him in his cruel passion,—and the
    strong, heavy hand lay on his breast like molten lead, when he remembered, that
    with its weight he had driven her out to her untimely grave.</p>
<p>It seemed to him so piteous a thing, to think of this poor stricken creature,
        loaded<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7184-280"/> with the curse of his unkind
    rebuke—wandering away into the green woods, to die there like a wounded bird
    beneath some tree; and this was the image, that through that long night of
    watching, presented itself again and again to his remorseful soul.</p>
<p>Morning came at length, and with it Mrs. Hartley, merely to tell him in a voice
    choked with sobs, that no tidings of poor Millicent had been obtained. Aylmer
    could not speak, his self‐abhorrence was so intense—he started up to seek her,
    and die with her if need be’, then remembering the blindness, the helplessness
    that chained him to his couch, he fell back in an agony of most impotent sorrow.
    Mrs. Hartley, who was utterly exhausted and now almost despairing, sat down for
    a few minutes to think what further efforts should be made, however hopeless she
    feared them to be—and there was a complete silence in the<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7184-281"/> room, whilst they remained together absorbed in their
    bitter thoughts.</p>
<p>It was during this stillness, that both of them suddenly heard the measured tramp
    as of many feet, coming along the path which led past the windows to the house.
    Mrs. Hartley perceived at the same time, and in an under tone communicated to
    Stephen, that a party of peasants, carrying a sort of <foreign xml:lang="fre">brancard</foreign>, had entered the hall.</p>
<p>Intense agitation rendered them both motionless. She endeavoured to rise, that
    she might go to meet them, but all power had deserted her aged limbs, and she
    could only wait listening to the ominous sounds without. Aylmer’s condition was
    fearful, blind and palsied in such a moment, it was as though he were chained
    down with bands of iron. The peasants, finding no one in the outer rooms, came
    on with their burden to that of Aylmer; the door opened,—slowly the tramping
        footsteps<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7184-282"/> entered; they carried amongst
    them a rude litter, formed of branches roughly cut, and upon it, gathered into a
    heap, lay a fragile form, altogether motionless, her clinging garments wet with
    the dews of night, her dripping hair veiling the pallid face; one cold white
    hand hung down, and seemed to have beat against the stones as they bore her on,
    for it was cut and bruised.</p>
<p>“Is she dead?” sobbed Mrs. Hartley, falling on her knees beside the litter, and
    hiding her face on Millicent’s arm, that she might not look on so piteous a
    spectacle.</p>
<p>“Not dead, we hope, as yet,” said one of the peasants, “her pulse fluttered a
    little when we raised her, but she is altogether senseless.”</p>
<p>“We found her lying just as you see here, under one of the forest trees,” said
    another, “and we think she must have lain thus motionless all night, for the
    leaves which the wind has swept down since last evening, had gathered in a heap
    on her head<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7184-283"/> and face;—her breath had not
    stirred them.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley took courage then to look upon her, as these words seemed to give
    some hope, and gently lifted the wet hair from the sweet face she had so loved
    to gaze upon. Millicent was like a marble statue, colourless and rigid,—no
    breath on the white lips, not a shiver in the blue‐veined eyelids, sternly
    closed. Mrs. Hartley saw that she was in a death‐like trance, from which it was
    doubtful if ever she would awake. She understood it all. Stricken at heart,
    sinking under the load of his bitter reproach, she had gone staggering out; and
    as, darker and darker, rose the thought of his hate upon her soul, and the
    memory of the intense love with which he had uttered Juliet’s name, the life had
    seemed to ebb back from her breast,—for there is a limit to human suffering,
    there is a point at which the frail powers within us can endure no more,—and
    then her<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7184-284"/> fainting soul had given way. This
    mercy was extended to her that she ceased to feel.</p>
<p>She had fallen down senseless, motionless, among the stones and thorns, beneath
    the rocking branches of the forest trees,—and there, the livelong night, that
    desolate child had lain. The dews of heaven had wet her pallid face, the
    mountain winds had beat around her helpless form,—the thorns had pierced
    her,—the night air had chilled her to the heart, but she neither felt nor heeded
    nature’s persecution; for colder, keener than the mountain air, more dread than
    the mountain blast, sharper than the merciless thorns, and poisonous as ever
    midnight dew, was the one deadly thought that struck her down, perhaps to perish
    there—the thought of his revealed hate.</p>
<p>The peasants’ task was now complete; with many a look of lingering pity on
        that<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7184-285"/> hapless being, they took their leave,
    and Mrs. Hartley, restored to energy by hope, went to seek restoratives which
    might <corr>recall</corr> poor Millicent to life.</p>
<p>When she returned she found that Aylmer, who had listened in silent agitation to
    all that passed, had groped his way to the spot where Millicent lay, and had
    fallen on his knees beside her. He had raised her head, and wound his arms round
    her; he was calling her now by every most endearing term, breathing on the cold
    lips, that his warm breath might <corr>recall</corr> hers, holding the chill, wet hands in his bosom,—and Mrs. Hartley
    paused with a feeling of awe, for she felt there was a stronger power at work to <corr>recall</corr> the ebbing life of Millicent Grey than any she could use. The
    declaration of Stephen Aylmer’s hate and anger, had brought her to the verge of
    death—would the expression of his love restore her? It was even so. The<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7184-286"/> deadly paralysis relaxed in the heart that
    faintly began to beat against his own,—the chilled breast softly warmed with its
    first faint sigh,—the poor glazed eyes opened with a dim wandering gaze, as the
    fluttering lids rose and fell, and settled at last on the face of him so awfully
    beloved, whilst he bent over her with intense affection.</p>
<p>She seemed utterly bewildered, her senses had evidently not returned fully, only
    she was conscious on what arm she lay, and a sense of unutterable sweetness of
    repose passed through her soul. She nestled closer to him, and her eyes closed
    again, as if thus to die, were rapture beyond all words, and the yet feeble life
    seemed almost to forsake her, for she fainted again.</p>
<p>But now the swoon was only temporary, his voice had fully restored her to
    existence, and Mrs. Hartley carried her away to administer the care which at
    last was very necessary.</p>
<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7184-287"/>
<p>A serious illness was the consequence of Millicent’s exposure to the night air,
    and during its duration, Aylmer seemed to live for her alone; when he was not
    allowed to be with her, he lay at the threshold of her door, and there could be
    no doubt that her recovery was greatly facilitated, by the consciousness that
    his love had at last come forth abundantly to answer hers.</p>
<p>Yet when, after she was fully restored to health, he pleaded with her, that now,
    at length, after such storms and weary conflicts, they might both pass into a
    haven of rest in their mutual affection; when he besought her to become his
    wife, and terminate for ever the desolation in which both had suffered much, it
    was Millicent who shrunk from a union, and hesitated to give the promise he so
    longed for.</p>
<p>Not that she feared him, or that her deathless affection was diminished one iota,
    but that at last the natural dignity of the<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7184-288"/>
    woman was roused within her; she could not forget the tone of his voice when he
    shrieked out Juliet’s name. It seemed her, who had never known a shadow of
    change, in her true heart, that he could not have turned such passionate
    affection back to her again; she did not understand how much of delusion there
    had been in his love for Juliet, how deep‐seated the tenderness which her own
    noble character had raised in his breast, since his blindness proved her worth
    to him. She feared it might be compassion which had caused the change within
    him, that else would have rendered her so supremely happy. And what woman could
    endure such a thought as this! most deeply it rankled in poor Millicent’s heart
    after all her trials.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartley and Aylmer long combated the idea vainly; It was in truth most
    utterly false; Aylmer valued and loved her now as she deserved, and esteemed
        the<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7184-289"/> treasure of her noble heart as a gift
    beyond all earthly price. Gradually this truth, so apparent in every word he
    uttered, found its way convincingly to her mind; but it was not until one day,
    when with all the eloquence of real feeling, he pleaded his infirmities as a
    claim upon her charity, that she yielded, and became once more his promised
    wife.</p>

<head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
<p><hi>IT</hi> would have been hard to have found in the wide world two happier
    beings than Millicent Grey and Stephen Aylmer, when at last,—her hand tight
    clasped in his, they sat together, day by day, and spoke of the long life of
    joy, which was so shortly to commence for them, in each other’s society.</p>
<p>Millicent believed she had found the spirit’s rest at last, the satisfaction,
    complete and full, of the mysterious longing of her whole being.</p>
<p>She still was convinced that none could<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7184-291"/> find it
    elsewhere than in human love, but she thought, judging from her bitter
    experience, that all played not well or wisely, their parts in the difficult
    game of life, and so lost their chance of the one sole means of happiness, which
    existed for man in affection felt and answered. Therefore still holding this
    mistaken creed, Millicent did but rejoice the more ardently, that after many
    struggles, the prize was hers—that she had not, like so many, drawn a blank in
    that great lottery.</p>
<p>If anything even for a moment disturbed her perfect happiness, it was the
    frequent apparition at the window of the room in which they usually sat, of a
    haggard, fearful face—that with the tangled hair hanging over a brow dark with
    despair, and a look of indescribable anguish in the wild, sorrow haunted eyes,
    cast in upon them a glance of utter wretchedness, that might have touched the
    coldest spirit.</p>
<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7184-292"/>
<p>But happiness is a selfish thing; in sadness mostly we have compassion on the
    kindred suffering, and we cannot bear to see the tears of others, when our own
    are falling, because we know their bitterness. In the time of her own great
    desolation, Millicent had mourned for Arthur Egerton; but now in her absorbing
    joy, it is doubtful if ever she remembered what he must be suffering, except
    when that face of agony passed like a frightful vision before her eyes.</p>
<p>This indifference on her part served but to exasperate the unhappy man. He knew
    all that had passed; he saw them, day after day, before him, for he was drawn to
    that sight which pierced his very soul, by some irresistible attraction. He saw
    them in their perfect happiness, and truly all hope for him seemed utterly
    destroyed; nor was he otherwise than inconceivably wretched, but still, not yet
    had there passed from his soul the strange, mysterious conviction, which<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7184-293"/> had haunted him, ever since Aylmer first
    came, and stood between him and Millicent,—the deep certainty, that in some way
    it would be given to him, to tear her out of his arms, even at the very last!
    And this he still believed. He knew not how it was to be; he had formed no plan,
    no cruel or wicked intention respecting them. Most utterly as his apostate soul
    was prostrate in idolatry before her, never yet had its degenerate condition
    prompted him to crime; but like all men who turn a deaf ear to the voice of
    truth, he was a fatalist, and what he imagined was written in the decrees of
    destiny,—destiny, he felt sure, would accomplish. This idea supported and
    sustained him—in it he lived, or the sight of their happiness must have driven
    him to insanity; and they knew not that he tracked their steps wherever they
    went; for Aylmer was now able, led by Millicent, to walk out daily into the
    woods, and breathe again the sweet breath<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7184-294"/> of
    nature. They knew it not, or they must have pitied the maddening envy with which
    he watched the blind man lean so tenderly upon the dear hand, whose happiest
    task it was to smooth life’s path for him; and saw the sweet eyes, which Aylmer
    called his light of day, for truly they gave sight to him, by their unceasing
    watchfulness, ever turning to him as the sunflower to the sun.</p>
<p>“And do you really mean you are going to leave me one whole hour?” said Aylmer
    fondly, as Millicent sat by him on a bright summer morning.</p>
<p>“I really am; but I shall go so quickly, and return so soon, you scarce will miss
    me.”</p>
<p>“Not miss you! even for a single instant, darling? You would miss the light if it
    were taken from you but one moment, and so you are my light, and I cannot bear
    that you should go from me, any more than you could bear an utter darkness.”</p>
<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7184-295"/>
<p>It made her heart beat thick and faint with joy to hear such words.</p>
<p>“Indeed, it is bitter to me to go even for one little hour, but I must do it, it
    would not be right to neglect the poor creature who is waiting for me.”</p>
<p>“I do not see why you should be kind to any one but me,” said Aylmer, playfully.
    “You are mine, my own most treasured possession, and I will have it, that it is
    your highest duty to stay with me.”</p>
<p>“And so it is my high and happy duty,” said Millicent. “Do you know, I do not
    think, that above three times in my life, it could be my duty to leave you; and
    so this is the first time, and I hope the other two will not occur for twenty
    years to come.”</p>
<p>“Could you not put this one off for ten, or even five?—five years hence I will
    let you leave me two whole hours instead of one; come, is it a bargain?”</p>
<p>“But you forget, that if I agreed to that,<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7184-296"/> the
    bed‐ridden old woman to whom I am going, must wait five years to know whether
    her son is alive or dead, who fell from a ladder in the village next hers; and
    now I am to tell her to‐day that he lives, and to make her happy, dear Stephen.
        <emph>We</emph> know what it is to fear for those we love, so most of all we
    should show compassion.”</p>
<p>“You shall go,” said Aylmer, touched by these words; “and which road do you
    take?”</p>
<p>“The path by the cliff, where we walk every day.”</p>
<p>“I know that road so well, I am sure I could find my way alone, so if you do not
    return in an hour, I shall certainly come to meet you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do not attempt that!” exclaimed Millicent, anxiously; “there is a part of
    the road which is extremely dangerous; it leads along the very edge of the
    precipice.”</p>
<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7184-297"/>
<p>“Ah, that is where I feel your hand clasp mine so tightly, and you guide me with
    such care. I am sure that pleasant recollection will make me know the spot, and
    then I can walk cautiously.”</p>
<p>“No, dearest Stephen, pray do not try it alone; indeed, I should be in terror if
    I thought you would; a false turn just there would be destruction. Promise me
    you will not go.”</p>
<p>“Indeed, I shall promise nothing of the kind,” said Aylmer, laughing, “for if you
    are afraid, it will make you come back to me all the sooner.”</p>
<p>“That it will, most certainly,” said Millicent. She kissed his hand as she spoke,
    in token of farewell, and so they parted.</p>
<p>On that path, their accustomed walk, where day by day, Arthur Egerton waited and
    watched for hours, that he might look on <emph>her</emph> face as she passed
    him, he now lay hidden expecting the coming of Millicent Grey.</p>
<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7184-298"/>
<p>And his patient, miserable watching was soon rewarded; he saw her approaching
    earlier to‐day than usual, and alone. She came springing up the mountain path,
    with the dancing step that told what a light, joyous heart she carried,—glad and
    bright was her face as the morning itself,—sparkling in her eyes was the
    sunshine of hope, as the beams that lay fair on the rugged hills,—wild and gay
    as the song of the woodland bird, her sweet voice carolled in the clear, blue
    air,—a very vision of gladness and joy she seemed, bright in her youth and
    happiness, as when first he saw her in the old halls at Rookcliffe, and felt
    that his soul was hers with a surpassing love.</p>
<p>Surely the worm that crawls the earth, is not so abject as man, in the egotism of
    absorbing passion? She was his fellow creature, inheritor with himself of the
    common death, condemned, like him, to a life<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7184-299"/>
    so full of sorrow, and in joy so rare,—susceptible to the misery he now was
    enduring, whose anguish he knew so well,—and yet, rather would he have seen her
    as she had been heretofore, wasted and wan, and bowed to the earth, loaded with
    that burden too heavy to bear,—an affection unsought and unshared,—as now in her
    gladness and peace; triumphant, with the cup of life’s happiness full to the
    brim.</p>
<p>Onward she came, with the sweet voice singing, and back he shrank from her bright
    approach as the serpent from the light of day; he cowered among the bushes
    unseen, till the light form went by, and then the parting branches showed the
    dark, haggard face gazing after her with baneful glance. She had paused on the
    dangerous spot of which she had spoken to Aylmer, where the path edged off from
    the precipice and took an abrupt turn to the abyss, and her thoughts flew
    swiftly to him who lay<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7184-300"/> dreaming of her even
    then, and back she looked, with her eyes of love, to the châlet whose very walls
    were dear for his sake. Arthur caught the glance, and shrunk closer down to the
    ground where he grovelled, whilst she went on with a swifter step, and her
    echoing song floating far on the wind.</p>
<p>Long hours he lay there, for despair has no time or space, and his soul was
    stretched on the rack of thought.</p>
<p>At length, on that mountain path, another step came sounding near, toiling up,
    slow, heavy, and feeble, where she had past with her bounding feet,—wearily
    straining his new‐found strength, the blind man came, cautiously trying his
    uncertain powers.</p>
<p>Arthur Egerton shrunk not from him, as he had shrunk from the sweet face
    Millicent,—a sudden impulse constrained him to rise, to stand forth and confront
    this blinded cripple, who had stolen his light of life from him.</p>
<pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7184-301"/>
<p>Aylmer heard the sound of the moving feet, and guiding his steps by the stick on
    which he leant, drew near.</p>
<p>“Who is there?” he said.</p>
<p>“Arthur Egerton!”</p>
<p>“Ah, is it you? I am glad I have met you. Did you see my Millicent pass this
    way?”</p>
<p>“I saw Millicent Grey go past.”</p>
<p>“Then I shall meet her returning soon.”</p>
<p>“Then I shall see you come back together.”</p>
<p>“Yes, together!—as we shall soon be for life; but tell me, am I taking the right
    direction? The path turns here to escape the precipice, it leads this way, does
    it not?”</p>
<p>He advanced a few steps, and paused for an answer.</p>
<p>A bitter laugh rose to the lips of Arthur; the blind man was within one yard of
    the precipice—he had missed the turning, and one step more would carry him over
        an<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7184-302"/> abyss some hundred feet deep. Arthur
    Egerton stood and looked at him, waiting there so unconsciously on the brink of
    destruction. He had no thought of murder in his mind, though he hated that blind
    man with an intense hate, but there was a very whirlwind of passion raging
    through him; fierce and strong did the tide of exultation sweep over his soul,
    as he thought how, at one word of his, this man, possessor of all he most
    coveted on earth,—this man, but now triumphing over him in the calm of his
    happiness, assured in her love,—this man, the bane, the curse of his life,—would
    even now go crashing down this fearful abyss, to a death most frightful; yes,
    one word—one word—and the fond eyes of Millicent Grey would seek him in vain on
    the face of the earth! One word—one word—and never more living love should stand
    between her and himself! Yet he thought not of saying it; de‐<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7184-303"/> graded as he was, his heart would have shrunk from so
    tremendous a crime with horror and fear; only he loved to gloat, with the
    fiercest delight, on the feeling that Stephen Aylmer was now in his power—that
    revenge, consummate and full, and the desire of his soul, in the death of that
    man, were before him. He prolonged the time, that he might taste this unholy
    ecstasy—but the voice of Aylmer sounded again, more impatiently,</p>
<p>“Tell me, am I not right?”</p>
<p><emph>Now</emph> was the moment when, with one breath from his lips, he might
    have accomplished all his spirit, long hungering and thirsting, required. Oh,
    ruin! to relinquish the power,— his own but for one brief instant! Oh, horror to
    use it!—horror impossible to contemplate!</p>
<p>The blood rushed to his head, his temples throbbed furiously, every pulse in his
    body beat madly—the hands were convul‐<pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7184-304"/> sively
    clasped—the lips opened gaspingly‐forth came the sound of his answer “<emph rend="sc">YES</emph>!”</p>
<p>“Yes!” not <emph>his</emph> the voice that uttered that word most fatal, he swore
    it to his dying day; not his, but some demon who spoke it through his own cursed
    lips. He had not meant it—he had not thought it—he would have given his soul to
    recall it ere well it was past; but the word had gone forth with a human life
    freighted. On that breath, from his mouth, an existence hung, and for the soul
    of a man, that breath contained the thunders of eternity. It past his lips, it
    went forth with its mission, blind agent he was, of a supreme decree—not the
    less an agent in guilt. The word was spoken—the step was taken—down, down,
    crushing down, through the dark abyss, Stephen Aylmer plunged on to his
    death.</p>
<p>Whirling down through the deep blue air, caught for a moment by the jagged<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7184-305"/> rocks, flung back by them to the stones that
    waited below; revolving in a thick cloud of dust, bearing with it the fragments
    rocks and trees, swifter than the eye could follow, ere the living heart could
    have beat a few times, the body lay mangled—soulless—<emph rend="sc">DEAD</emph>, struck down in a shattered heap at the foot of that great
    ravine.</p>
<p>For Stephen Aylmer this world was nought—for Stephen Aylmer this life was done.
    The trial was over, the doom was sealed—the soul was gone, to the Far
    Unseen.</p>
<p>And gay on the mountain air, was the sound of the sweet voice singing, as down
    through the pine‐wood she sped to that path, and thought on the arms that would
    open to greet her.</p>
<p><emph>He</emph> heard it—he heard that voice—the unwilling murderer, as with
    ghastly face he peered over that dread abyss, which seemed to him filled with an
    ocean of blood, whose waves were swelling up to engulf him.</p>
<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7184-306"/>
<p>At the sound of the sweet voice singing, he fled.—Heaven save us from that man’s
    agony! The demon went with him who had uttered the word, the taunting, laughing,
    exulting demon! And another went with him,—a spectre, the great gaunt spectre
    Remorse, who twined her hideous arms around him and clasped him close to her
    breast as a loving bride—for now she was his wedded companion for life.</p>
<p>Then through the chaos of horror that raged in his breast, certain words,—certain
    words heard in childhood, came with a deepening agony, and seemed to inscribe
    themselves in letters of burning fire on his soul—they were these:—<quote>
        <l>Cursed is he that maketh the blind to go out of his way.</l>
    </quote> And it was as though he heard echoing loud on his ear, how the deep rolling
    voice of the people answered and said, <emph rend="sc">AMEN</emph>.</p>
            </div>

<head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
<p><hi>AND</hi> it befell Arthur Egerton, as many a condemned man on the scaffold
    might attest it befalls most criminals,—he who had lived all his life in
    practical, if not in intellectual, unbelief, now that the consciousness of a
    deadly crime was on his soul, became possessed of a full, perfect, and for him,
    most appalling faith, in the revelation of a future judgment and an eternal
    punishment. Deep penitence came in like a flood upon his soul—penitence not only
    for the crime, but for<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7184-308"/> the idolatrous,
    unrestrained love which had prompted it.</p>
<p>One thought, one wish, one dream was present with him night and day. To be
    forgiven, by years of a life of penance; to show repentance, and to be forgiven;
    but he felt that he dared not ask, nor pray, nor so much as breathe the faintest
    desire for the pardon of heaven, till he had obtained that of her, whom on earth
    he had so deeply, fatally injured.</p>
<p>He knew nothing of her, excepting only that she had not died, when the link that
    bound her to earth had been so rudely snapped asunder; he knew not how it had
    fared with her, since she took her last look of the mangled form, she would have
    cherished with her heart’s life.</p>
<p>He knew that the lifeless body of Stephen Aylmer had been found, and carried home
    the same day that he met his cruel death, and that shortly after it had been
        conveyed<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7184-309"/> for interment to a burial‐place
    adjoining a church on the mountain; but never once, from that hour to this, had
    his eyes looked on the face, or his ears heard the voice of sweet Millicent
    Grey.</p>
<p>Yet henceforward, for him, all existence was gathered up into two great works,
    which living he must accomplish:—first, to obtain mercy and pardon from her—and
    then to seek the mercy and pardon of heaven.</p>
<p>So, night and day, he wandered round the châlet, wearing the rocks with kneeling
    close to it, for hours together, still ever hoping—hoping—he might but see her
    come, where he could lay himself at her feet, and bid her trample on him, if she
    would. And months passed on, but he had patience, for he lived but in this
    thought; and so at last, the longing, wasting desire, was accomplished.</p>
<p>It was a fair summer morning, glorious and bright, just such a day, as that on
        which<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7184-310"/> she went forth in her gladness, with
    the sweet voice carolling, and light step dancing, to meet her final
    despair.</p>
<p>The murderer, with the spectre Remorse, to whom he was wedded, at his side, knelt
    on the rock, whence he could see her dwelling;—when it was given him to look
    upon her once again. Across that threshold, with a calm, gliding step, there
    passed what seemed to him more like a spirit than a human being—so wan, so
    wasted. Surely death had passed already on that bloodless cheek, that pure,
    transparent forehead.</p>
<p>Surely no inhabitant of earth ever looked to heaven with eyes so spiritual, so
    holy, glittering with pure light, like the stars in the sky. What a stormless
    serenity on that face, pallid and delicate as monumental marble! What an
    imploring expression of meekness in the white, half‐parted lips! What a depth of
    utter submission in the folding of those pale hands on the still fair<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7184-311"/> bosom; but so fragile, so unlike a living being,
    moving with the light wind, like the slender form of a white and stainless lily,
    gliding along without a movement of those quiet hands, or a change of expression
    in the serene, pale countenance. It was thus, as with spirit‐feet, that she
    passed him, and he arose and followed after her.</p>
<p>Rocking to and fro with every breath of wind, while gently waved the white robes
    around her, the tranquil figure glided on: in the golden sunshine, in the warm,
    glowing hues of day, she looked like a pale sheeted ghost, flitting back with
    its noiseless step to the rest of its own quiet grave.</p>
<p>And to a grave she went,—in one sense her own, for her heart lay buried there.
    They had made the couch of his deep repose beneath a tall pine‐tree, a sweet,
    fair spot, for the long grass waved there and the flowers were growing, and none
    need have dreamt of the worms beneath;<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7184-312"/> and she
    passed on, so light the form, her feet left no mark on the turf,—and by the side
    of that grave she knelt down. Then she folded the meek hands prayerfully, and
    upward fixed those pure, holy eyes, with a rapt and intense contemplation, as
    though the glory of the skies were drawing her soul through them to heaven. Her
    lips moved not, and no sound was uttered,—she might have been what she most
    resembled, a statue of snow‐white stone.</p>
<p>Creeping on to her, cowering earthwards, like a dark, blighting shadow, came the
    penitent man; nearer and nearer he stole, trembling and gasping, fearing almost
    he should see her pass away like a vision, too fair and too angel‐like for this
    cold cruel world.</p>
<p>But still she remained, so calm and so motionless: the fair lids drooped not over
    the deep, longing gaze, and her quiet breath stirred not the soft summer air.
    Then he<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7184-313"/> came and laid him down in the dust
    beside her.</p>
<p>He told her all,—all his terrible tale, and confessed that from him had the word
    gone forth, which consigned the being she had loved so well to his death of
    anguish, and herself to despair. He writhed on the ground as he spoke, for it
    seemed to him superhuman that she should think of forgiveness now,—yet he asked
    it, as the frantic man, dying of thirst, asks the draught of pure water that
    alone can save him. He had not looked on her face, so he knew not how she had
    borne these tidings, and her sweet voice had breathed no sound while he spoke;
    but when he asked for pardon her answer came slowly. She rose from her knees and
    stood upright, softly she laid the fair, transparent hand on the dust‐soiled
    head of the penitent man,—clear and sweet as the loveliest music, her voice
    breathed out on the summer air:—</p>
<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7184-314"/>
<p>“I forgive you deeply and fully, as I pray that I may be forgiven.”</p>
<p>The hands rested there a moment as if with a silent blessing, then, like the
    white wings of a dove, from his head were lifted and folded meekly across her
    own calm breast.</p>
<p>She resumed her place on the quiet grave, and he felt as though waters most pure
    and refreshing had passed on his guilty soul; but he dared not linger near her,
    lest a feeling of joy should steal into his heart. No right had he to know aught
    on this earth save that one word <emph>repentance</emph>, yet his heart groaned
    to know that she was, indeed, comforted,—his gentle, beloved victim. Faintly he
    whispered,—</p>
<p>“Are you, indeed, at rest?” and she answered,</p>
<p>“I rest, as I never rested on earth before:—hear me, and learn life’s truth from
    my lips,—if sorrow hath not taught you already. I thought that the soul’s repose
    was in human love, and thus far I was right, that in Love<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7184-315"/> alone the immortal spirit can live, but the human
    love is only the type of that which can never die. For the glorious substance I
    mistook the faint shadow, and therefore I erred and suffered. Then in mercy, to
    the sweet earthly love bright wings were given, that bore it away from my breast
    to heaven, and my soul following after it, upward stole, to find
        <emph>there</emph> the True Love that faileth never. I found it, and now I
    rest in a rest undying,—so may you find it, and so repose.”</p>
<p>The low voice died away on his ear like the sigh of the summer wind when night
    closes in. He heard the light feet echo past, and the waving of her garments as
    she glided away, but he dared not look up, he was spell‐bound there.</p>
<p>So never more did he look on her face, or hear her sweet voice again.</p>
<p>Arthur Egerton went out from the shores of Europe, to the burning regions of
        tropical<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7184-316"/> lands; he joined himself to a
    company of men, strong in purpose and stout of heart, who had devoted themselves
    to the good of their fellow‐creatures. They had made an offering of their lives
    for the one great purpose of raising a brute people from their deep
    degradation,—a nation who lived like wild beasts of prey,—whose existence was
    but vitality,—whose spirits were steeped in a moral death.</p>
<p>The life of their benefactors among them was full of torment, and danger, and
    toil; but none so toiled in torture and pain, as the remorseful man that went
    with them. He willed to be the slave of all,—he chose the heaviest burdens,—the
    hardest task; no complaint passed his lips, no rest did he seek:—to a practical
    repentance he vowed his life, and well hath he kept that vow.</p>
<p> * * * *</p>
<p>Long years had past, when in the twilight sky, one summer’s evening, a sunbeam
    lingered. It was the last sweet smile of the<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7184-317"/>
    dying day, a soft ray of golden light, and it followed not the sun when he sunk
    to rest, as though it yet had a mission on earth. Down from the darkening heaven
    it stole, and sped over forest and plain,—it did but tinge them with its pale
    pure light, for it rested not till its task was done, and onward passed to the
    appointed place. To a vast noble city it swiftly came,—along crowded districts
    and narrow streets it carried its gentle radiance, till through the latticed
    window of a lowly house it passed into a still dark room.</p>
<p>That house was known to all who suffered near,—refuge for the orphan,—home for
    the penitent,—dwelling for the blind, the infirm, and aged; no sorrow that
    touches the human heart, could fail to find sympathy there.</p>
<p>And the sunbeam entered the quiet room, for here must its work be done,—and it
    settled in glory on the pure pale brow of one who lay there most placid and
    calm.</p>
<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7184-318"/>
<p>That beam might have travelled the wide world over, and failed to meet a sight
    more holy and bright, than that which it lit with its glory now.</p>
<p>For the countenance where it shone in its golden light, wore that aspect of
    loveliness most serene, which never on earth can be found, save only on the face
    of the holy dead.</p>
<p>Oh the unutterable beauty of gentle sleep, with which the white lids rested on
    the whiter cheek! oh, smile of ineffable joy that lingered on the pale sweet
    mouth! How the aching heart, throbbing so thick and fast, faints with desire to
    know that rest!</p>
<p>Fit mission for the last bright sunbeam, to lend its radiance to that fair
    corpse, for the night shall be short for both, and a glorious morning shall wake
    for them.</p>
<p>Those who had known her past history, had placed in her dead hands the types
        of<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7184-319"/> her life. In one, they had laid a few
    flowers of earth, for in those she had trusted in her morning of days; now the
    white fingers held them not, and they had withered away as they rested there.
    But the other hand, still in a tight fond grasp, remained closed round the holy
    symbol of her faith which she had pressed to her dying heart; and there it yet
    lay on that placid breast, earnest and pledge of the rest, her spirit had found
    at last.</p>
