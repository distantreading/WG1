<p><hi>IT</hi> was melancholy to admit that Italy also had ceased to
interest him, thought Hamlin, as he smoked his cigarette on the
hillside above the Villa Arnolfini; melancholy, although, in truth, he
had suspected as much throughout the journey, and, indeed, before
starting. Pale, milky morning sky, deepening into luminous blue
opposite the fast‐rising sun; misty blue‐green valley bounded by
unsubstantial Apennine peaks and Carrara crags; yellow shimmer of
vines and of maize, green sparkle of pine and fir branches, glitter of
vermilion sand crumbling under his feet among the sear grass<pb n="4"
xml:id="VAB7107-004"/> and the brown cistus tufts,—all these things
seemed to have lost for him their emotional colour, their imaginative
luminousness. He tried to realise the time when all these things had
given him a thrill, had gone to his head, nay, when the mere sense of
being in Italy had done so; but now the very words “thrill” and
“intoxication” seemed false, disgusting, and vulgar. Formerly, at
least, such things had soaked into him, dyed his mind with colour,
saturated it with light; instead of remaining, as now, so separate
from him, so terribly external, that to perceive them required almost
an effort. He and the world had been becoming paler in the last three
years; it was melancholy, but that seemed quite natural and in
keeping; and besides, a washed‐out world, a man with worn‐out
feelings, have quite as much psychologic interest for a poet as the
reverse.</p> <p>Walter Hamlin had never been your splash‐of‐scarlet
and dash‐of‐orange‐and‐skyblue, lust‐and‐terror kind of lyrist; but he
had begun his poetical career with a quiet concentra‐<pb n="5"
xml:id="VAB7107-005"/> tion of colour, physical and moral, which had
made his earliest verses affect one like so many old church windows,
deep flecks of jewel lustre set in quaint stiff little frames, with a
great deal of lead between, and supreme indifference to anatomy and
perspective. And as a painter (perhaps just because, despite his own
contrary opinion)—he certainly had less original genius as painter
than as poet—he had continued in this habit of gemlike harmonies of
colour; but in his poetry, and in his reality as a man, it struck him
that he had little by little got paler and paler, colours turning
gradually to tints, and tints to shadows; pleasure, pain, hope,
despair, all reduced gradually to a delicate penumbra, a diaphanous
intellectual pallor, of which this utter listlessness, this
indifference even to having grown indifferent, was, as it were, the
faint key‐note. The world was a pale and prismatic mist, full of
vague, formless ghosts, in which it was possible to see only as far as
to‐day; and, indeed, why wish to see that paler to‐day called<pb n="6"
xml:id="VAB7107-006"/> to‐morrow?  Perhaps there was a little
depression added to Hamlin’s usual listlessness.  It had given him a
kind of little shock to see Melton Perry again, after those twelve or
thirteen years; bringing back to him the time when he had been the
most brilliant and eccentric of that little knot of æsthetic
undergraduates, at whose strange doings as Greek gods, and Provençal
poets, and Norse heroes, Oxford had murmured in those philistine days,
and which had welcomed young Hamlin, with his girlish beauty and
pre‐Raphaelite verses, as a sort of mixture of Apollo and Eros,
sitting at the head of the supper‐table dressed in green silk, with
rose garlands on his head, while Perry led a chorus of praise, dressed
in indigo velveteen, with peacocks’ feathers in his button‐hole, and
silver‐gilt grasshoppers in his hair. Poor old Perry! Absurd days
those were, thought Hamlin, as he walked slowly towards the house,
through the grass and hemlock bending with dew, pushing aside the fig
branches and vine trails along the narrow path between the<pb n="7"
xml:id="VAB7107-007"/> terraced olives; absurd days those, and at
which he could now, having grown grave and listless, only faintly
smile.  Still the sight of Perry had brought back to him that
recurring sense that all those absurd lads of long‐gone days, turned
humdrum dons, and parsons, and squires for the most part, had had a
something, a spontaneity, an aristocratic fibre, a sort of
free‐bornness, which he missed among the clique‐and‐shop shoddy
æstheticism with which he now associated, and which sang his praises
as those boys had sung them so many years before.  Professional
poetry! professional art! faugh! thought Hamlin; it was that feeling
which had been making London odious to him of late, and sent him
abroad, he knew not whither. He was a poet himself, and a painter
also, to be sure; but somehow he liked to feel (and yet it oppressed
him) that he was not of the same stock as his fellow‐workers—that he
had his coats made by less romantic tailors, and cut his hair and
beard in less pictorial style.  The sense of his difference from all
those pen‐<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7107-008"/> and‐pencil‐driving men of
genius, those reviewer‐poets and clerk‐poets, those
once‐a‐week‐studio‐receiving painters; the sense of the dust and
smoke, as it were, of the æsthetic factory, had been choking him of
late: he would rather go and associate only with well‐dressed
numskulls, go and flirt with empty‐headed Faubourg St Germain ladies,
or emptier‐headed Monte Carlo ladies—he would not touch pen or brush
for years. It had been silly to accept Perry’s invitation to spend
September at the Villa Arnolfini; he had accepted, thinking of Perry
as he had been, a wild, roistering, half‐French creature, brought up
at Louis‐le‐Grand, and telling wicked French stories. Good heavens!
what a change! When the wretched, thin, wasted, depressed‐looking
creature, fit for a medieval picture of mansuetude, had greeted him by
night at the nearest station, and had driven him in the gig, he had
been quite unable to realise that this was indeed Melton Perry. But he
had understood all, all, when, in the bleak drawing‐room, in the glare
of an ill‐<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7107-009"/> trimmed lamp, that lank,
limp, lantern‐jawed leering creature with a Sapphic profile had come
forward and seized him by both hands, and kissed them, crying—</p>
<p>“Dear Mr Hamlin, I must kiss the hands that have opened the
paradise of body and soul to so many of us.”</p> <p>She, and her
speech, and the damp dab on his hands, had passed before him like a
nightmare; he felt that he would never be able to disassociate Mrs
Melton Perry from that horrible smell of ill‐trimmed, flickering
oil‐lamp.  It seemed to him dreadful—a sort of hideous, harpy‐like
proceeding—that his old friend should have thus been
metamorphosed.</p> <p>“You see,” Perry had said, “I must paint
things—well—not the sort of things I exactly admire,—because, you see,
there’s Mrs Perry and the children—five girls,—and last year’s
baby.”</p> <p>Perry’s depressed voice had remained in Hamlin’s
ears. This was the end of a bright, original fellow—married for love,
too! And<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7107-010"/> six children! Hamlin had
already made up his mind that he could not possibly hold out long at
the Villa Arnolfini. That Mrs Perry, with her leering Sapphic profile,
her almost amorous admiration, the limp gown, the five girls, and last
year’s baby, the all‐pervading smell of oil‐lamp, were too much for
him. In three days, he calculated, he might decently, on some pretext,
slip off to Florence. And then—why, from Florence he might go to
America. He thought all those big hotels, with the fifteen hundred
inmates and thirteen brass bands, all that tremendous strain,
telegraph‐telephone vulgarity, might be refreshing.</p> <p>Hamlin had
got to the bottom of the hill, and in front of him, nestled among the
olives and the vines, rose the Villa Arnolfini, a time‐ and
weather‐stained Tuscan country‐house, with its rose‐hedges gone wild
among the beans and artichokes, its grotesque ivy‐draped terra‐cotta
statues, its belvedere towers, from whose crannied sides and yellow
lichened tiles<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7107-011"/> the pigeons swept down
on to the lawn of overgrown grass, thick with dew in the blue morning
shadow. It had a sort of half‐romantic, half‐idyllic charm, which
Hamlin could not help recognising: it certainly was better than an
American hotel, with ten lifts, thirteen brass bands, and fifteen
hundred inmates. But, like everything else, it was a snare; for behind
those sleepy‐looking green shutters were the pink and blue
chromo‐lithograph pot‐boilers of Melton Perry, were the five girls and
the last year’s baby, nay, were the Sapphic leer and limp dresses of
Mrs Melton Perry herself.</p> <p>Making these reflections, Hamlin
pushed open the green and blistered house‐door and entered the wide
hall, with rickety eighteenth‐century chairs and tables marshalled
round the walls. There was one good thing about his hosts, he thought,
and that was, that they had no common breakfast, but invited their
guests to do whatsoever they pleased in the early morning. The hall
was very silent, and Ham‐<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7107-012"/> lin
wondered how he should get any breakfast. It struck him that he had
better go and ring the bell in his bedroom. But on going upstairs he
found there was no sign of a bell either in it or in the vast scantily
furnished drawing‐room, where a thick layer of dust reposed on tables
and mirrors, and the smell of last night’s oil‐lamp still lingered. He
saw the open door of Perry’s studio; it was empty, and so was the
adjoining dressing‐room, where boots and canvases littered the
floor. But on the mirror was a paper, on which was written in the
largest characters: “I am gone to sketch at the Lake of Massaciuccoli;
shan’t be back till lunch; please look after Hamlin.”</p> <p>“Confound
it!” thought Hamlin, “am I to be left in <foreign
xml:lang="fre">tête‐à‐tête</foreign> with Mrs Perry all the morning?”
But since Melton Perry thought nothing of leaving his guest alone all
the morning, he too—the guest—might surely be permitted to slip away
after breakfast from the effusive æstheticism of his
hostess. Having<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7107-013"/> found no sign of life
on the first floor, Hamlin went down‐stairs once more, and proceeded
to ramble about in search of breakfast, or, at least, of some
servant. The ground‐floor seemed to consist entirely of servants’
rooms, offices, and strange garners, where sacks of potatoes,
garden‐tools, silkworm‐mats, and various kinds of pods were gathered
together. They were all empty; and empty likewise was the kitchen, its
brass saucepans and huge spits left invitingly for any one who might
care to step through the open garden‐door. But next to the kitchen was
a sort of nursery, at least so he judged from the children’s chairs
and battered dolls lying about—and here a table was spread with cups
and saucers and jugs, and a cut loaf and a plate of figs. “This looks
more like it,” thought Hamlin, wondering what had become of the
inmates of this mysterious abode of sleep.  Suddenly he heard children
talking in a room at the end of the passage, and a sort of subdued,
deep, melancholy chant, like some church song. He went<pb n="14"
xml:id="VAB7107-014"/> to the door whence came the sounds, and knocked
gently. The childish chattering did not stop, nor the fitful gusts of
chant—deep, nasal, but harmonious and weird, with curious, sudden,
metallic falsetto notes, less like the voice of a woman than of a
youth.  Hamlin knocked again, and receiving no notice, boldly opened
the door and stood on the threshold. He was struck by the sight which
met him. The room was low and vaulted, with walls entirely frescoed
with dark‐blue skies sprinkled with birds, mountains like cheeses,
rivers, box‐like houses, people fishing, and plentiful ducks and
parrots on perches; a faint green shimmer of leaves came through the
open windows; three or four little yellow‐headed children were
scrambling on the floor, struggling violently over the funeral of a
doll in a biscuit‐tin. In the middle of the room was a large deal
table, covered with singed flannel, on the corner of which stood a
brasier with some flat‐irons, and a heap of crumpled pink pinafores;
and behind this table, her tall and<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7107-015"/>
powerful figure, in a close‐fitting white vest and white skirt,
standing out against the dark‐blue painted wall and the green shimmer
from outside, was a young woman bending over a frock which she was
ironing, her bare brown arms going up and down along the board; her
massive and yet girlish body bending with the movement, and singing
that strange chant which Hamlin had heard from outside.</p> <p>“I beg
your pardon,” said Hamlin, in Italian, as he stood in the doorway. The
children looked round, tittered, and made remarks in shrill whispers;
the girl stopped her work, stood erect, putting her iron on the
brasier, and stared full at Hamlin with large wide‐opened eyes of
strange dark‐greyish blue, beneath heavy masses of dark lustreless
hair, crimped naturally like so much delicate black iron wire, on her
narrow white brow.</p> <p>“I beg your pardon,” said Hamlin again; “but
can you tell me how I may get some breakfast?”</p> <pb n="16"
xml:id="VAB7107-016"/> <p>He could not help smiling in proffering this
innocent request, so serious and almost tragic was the face of the
girl.</p> <p>“It’s Mr Hamlin,” tittered the children, rolling under
the table, and hanging to the table‐cloth.</p> <p>The young woman eyed
Hamlin for a second in no very gracious manner; then answered, with a
certain contemptuous listlessness in her slightly hollowed pale cheeks
and beautifully curled but somewhat prominent lips—</p> <p>“I don’t
know anything about your breakfast, sir.” She spoke, to his surprise,
in perfect English, with only the faintest guttural Italian
accent. “Mr Perry went to sketch at Massaciuccoli early this morning,
and took the boy with him; Mrs Perry may never be disturbed till nine;
and the cook is gone to Lucca for provisions.”</p> <p>“That’s very
sad,” remarked Hamlin, laughing, and looking at this curious and
picturesque being.</p> <p>The girl seemed annoyed at being
discovered<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7107-017"/> in that guise, for she
pulled down her white sleeves quickly.</p> <p>“I suppose the cook has
orders about your breakfast,” she said, in a tone which seemed to put
an end to the conversation; and she took up her iron once more. “Mrs
Perry did not think you would want anything so early; the cook will be
back about nine.”</p> <p>But Hamlin would not be shaken off; the fact
was, he enjoyed watching this beautiful sullen creature much as he
might have enjoyed watching a cat whom he had disturbed in its
sleep.</p> <p>“Nine o’clock!” he said; “that’s a long time to
wait. Couldn’t you give me something to eat? I saw a table spread in
the next room.”</p> <p>The girl put down her iron with a sort of
subdued irritation of manner.</p> <p>“It’s the children’s breakfast,
sir,” she answered; “we have neither tea nor coffee.”</p> <p>“We have
milk,” said the eldest of the little girls pertly, “and figs.”</p> <pb
n="18" xml:id="VAB7107-018"/> <p>“Milk and figs!” exclaimed Hamlin;
“why, that’s a breakfast for the gods! and won’t you,” he went on
rather appealingly—“won’t you share a little of it with me?”</p>
<p>“You are Mrs Perry’s guest,” said the girl more sullenly than ever,
“and of course you are welcome to anything you choose.”</p> <p>Hamlin
felt rather taken aback.</p> <p>“Indeed!” he said. “I don’t wish to do
anything against the habits of the house, or disagreeable to you.”</p>
<p>“It is not against any rules,” she answered. “If you will excuse
me, I will see whether the milk is heated. The children will show you
the way.”</p> </div> <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7107-019"/> <div
type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER II.</head> <p><hi>HAMLIN</hi> felt
rather contrite and humiliated as he sat down at the square table,
with the two eldest children, pert little rosy and flaxen things, on
either side of him, and the three little ones staring at him, and then
suddenly making convulsive dives under the table‐cloth and behind each
other’s shoulders opposite. He was the furthest possible removed from
the kind of young man who persecutes pretty housemaids. Whatever
vagaries he might have had in his life, they were not of that sort;
and now, although he had merely intended to ask for some breakfast, he
found himself somehow in the position of pushing his presence upon a
servant girl. He was vexed with himself, and became very grave,
scarcely<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7107-020"/> answering the chatter of the
children by his side.</p> <p>“And you know,” said the eldest child, a
pretty little minx of eleven, fully conscious of her charms, “mamma
told us you were the great poet, and she read us a poem of yours about
Sir Troilus. Mamma always reads poetry to us—and we liked it so
much,—and I liked all about where he kisses the lady so much, and her
purple dress with the golden roses, and then about Love, where he
comes and takes her by the throat, and chokes her, and makes her feel
like a furnace. Mamma says it’s just like love. Mr Thaddeus Smith was
in love with the gardener’s girl when he came here last year, mamma
says.”</p> <p>“Good heavens!” thought Hamlin, “what a mamma and what
children!”</p> <p>“And mamma told us to get some myrtles and put them
in your room,” blurted out a smaller one.</p> <p>“Hush, Winnie! You
know you shouldn’t tell,” said the eldest.</p> <pb n="21"
xml:id="VAB7107-021"/> <p>“And you know,” insisted the younger, in her
little, impertinent lisp, “mamma said we should put the myrtles,
because you made poems about myrtles; and we were to have had on our
best frocks, and met you in the hall, and—”</p> <p>“Hush, Winnie!”</p>
<p>“And thrown roses on the floor before you; only then papa got a
telegram saying you were coming by the late train, and we had to go to
bed—”</p> <p>Miss Winnie’s revelations and her sister’s expostulations
were interrupted by the entry of the nurse, or governess, or whatever
else she might be, carrying a large jug of milk. She had slipped on a
skirt and loose jacket of striped peasant cotton, which at a distance
looked like a dull, rich purple.  She sat down at the head of the
table, and began silently helping the hot milk.</p> <p>“May I cut the
bread for you?” asked Hamlin, feeling quite shy from her silence.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you will know how to do<pb n="22"
xml:id="VAB7107-022"/> it,” she answered. “We have only yesterday’s
bread at this hour, until the cook returns from market.” When the milk
was helped and the bread cut, she said, rather sharply—</p> <p>“Now,
children, say your prayer.”</p> <p>The children immediately set up a
shrill chorus; the elder, who wished to show off, slowly—the little
ones, who were hungry, quicker; an absurdly pseudo‐poetical
thanksgiving, which reminded Hamlin of the sort of poetry presented to
rich foreigners by needy Italians on creamy, embossed, and illuminated
paper. He was struck by the fact that the girl did not join, but
waited passively through this religio‐poetical ceremony; doubtless, he
thought, because she was a Catholic.</p> <p>“That’s mamma’s Tuesday
hymn,” said Winnie; “she makes a different one for each day of the
week.”</p> <p>Whereupon the children fell vigorously to their
breakfast of bread and milk.  Heaven knows when Hamlin had eaten bread
and milk last—probably, he thought, not since he<pb n="23"
xml:id="VAB7107-023"/> had been out of frocks; but it seemed to him
pleasant and pastoral. He would have enjoyed this improvised breakfast
had the children chattered less incessantly (Hamlin did not care for
children), and had he not continued to feel rather as if he had been
courting a nursemaid. The young woman had as much as she could do in
pouring out more milk, giving out more figs, and cutting more slices
of bread and butter for the children; and her conversation was
entirely engrossed in admonitions to them not to spill their milk, not
to jump on their chairs, not to talk with their mouths full, and so
forth. She seemed determined, in her sullen indifferent way, to make
Hamlin understand that he might intrude his person at that
breakfast‐table, but that he had no chance of intruding his
personality upon her notice. But her very indifference afforded Hamlin
an opportunity, and, as it were, a right, to examine her appearance:
one may surely look at a person who obstinately refuses to notice
one. She was very beautiful, and even more than<pb n="24"
xml:id="VAB7107-024"/> beautiful—strange. She seemed very young,
certainly, thought Hamlin—not more than nineteen at most; but her
face, though of perfectly smooth complexion, without furrow or
faintest wrinkle, was wholly unyouthful; the look was not of age, for
you could not imagine her ever growing old, but of a perfect negation
of youth. Hamlin tried to think what she might have been as a child,
looking round on the childish faces about him, but in vain. The
complexion was of a uniform opaque pallor, more like certain old
marble than ivory; indeed you might almost imagine, as she sat
motionless at the head of the table, that this was no living creature,
but some sort of strange statue—cheek and chin and forehead of Parian
marble, scarcely stained a dull red in the lips, and hair of dull
wrought‐iron, and eyes of some mysterious greyish‐blue, slate‐tinted
onyx: a beautiful and sombre idol of the heathen.  And the features
were stranger and more monumental even than the substance in which
they seemed carved by<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7107-025"/> some sharp
chisel, delighting in gradual hollowing of cheek and eye, in sudden
cutting of bold groove and cavity of nostril and lip. The forehead was
high and narrow, the nose massive, heavy, with a slight droop that
reminded Hamlin of the head of Antinous; the lips thick, and of
curiously bold projection and curl; the faintly hollowed cheek
subsided gradually into a neck round and erect like a tower, but set
into the massive chest as some strong supple branch into a
tree‐trunk. He wondered as he looked at her; and wondered whether this
strange type, neither Latin nor Greek, but with something of Jewish
and something of Ethiopian subdued into a statuesque but most
un‐Hellenic beauty, had met him before. The nearest approach seemed to
be certain mournful and sullen heads of Michaelangelo, the type was so
monumental, and at the same time so picturesque; and as he looked at
the girl, it seemed, despite its strangeness, as if, at some dim
distant time, he had seen and known it well before.</p> <pb n="26"
xml:id="VAB7107-026"/> <p>He looked at her with the curiosity of an
artist examining a model, or a poet trying to solve a riddle; there
was, he felt conscious, nothing insolent or offensive in his
stare. Yet he felt he must break the silence; so, with real
indifference, he suddenly asked—</p> <p>“ How is it that you speak
English so marvellously well? No one would ever guess that you were
not English.”</p> <p>“I am English,” answered the girl.</p> <p>English
nationality had explained many otherwise unaccountable mixed types to
Hamlin; but this took him by surprise, and left him utterly
incredulous.  This girl certainly was no Englishwoman—a Jewess,
perhaps. No, never; no Jewess was ever so pure and statuesque of
outline: some Eastern, dashed with Hindoo or Negro; they were much
coarser, more common, of far more obvious, less subtle beauty.</p>
<p>“You mean English by adoption,” he suggested, “surely not by
blood?”</p> <p>“My mother was an Italian. I think her<pb n="27"

somewhere,where there are Spaniards and Moors,” she answered; “but my
father was Scotch. He came from Aberdeen.”</p> <p>“Have you ever been
in Scotland?” he asked, just by way of saying something to mitigate
the personalness of his previous questions.</p> <p>“No,” she answered,
and her lips closed as with a spring; then she added, as if to close
all further conversation, “I was born in Italy; my father was employed
at Spezia in the docks.”</p> <p>The eldest Miss Perry raised her
pretty little sentimental head pertly.</p> <p>“Annina’s father was one
of those who make the big men‐of‐war at Spezia.”</p> <p>“Oh, you know,
we once went with papa, and saw a man‐of‐war, and all the boilers and
big, big cannons,” interrupted a smaller one.</p> <p>“And he was a
bad, bad man,” went on the eldest, composedly. “He used to drink
quantities of <foreign xml:lang="ita">acquavite</foreign>; and one day
when he had<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7107-028"/> drunk so much <foreign
xml:lang="ita">acquavite</foreign>, do you know what he did? He tried
to throw Annina’s mother out of the window, and then shot himself with
a revolver.”</p> <p>Hamlin listened as the cruel words dribbled out,
and stared at the childish face. He had never taken any interest in
children; but he had never thought that a child could be so
deliberately (as it seemed to him) malignant. The words made his ears
burn, and he felt indignant, confused, and humiliated, as if he were a
party to them. He did not look at the girl; but he somehow saw, or
felt, the sullen, suppressed bitterness of shame in her tragic
face.</p> <p>“And is it true,” interrupted Winnie, “that you are going
to do our picture?  Mamma said you would want to paint us angels or
fairies. All the painters paint us, because, mamma says, we are the
most beautiful children in Florence. They always give us chocolate and
<foreign xml:lang="fre">marrons glacés</foreign> to keep us
quiet.”</p> </div> <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7107-029"/> <div
type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER III.</head> <p><hi>WHEN</hi> breakfast
was over, and she had made the children fold up their napkins, the
nurse took what remained of figs, bread, and milk to lock up in the
kitchen. Mildred, the eldest of the little Perrys, sidled up to
Hamlin, as he stood on the doorstep leading into the vineyard,
lighting a cigarette, and asked whether he would not like to see her
garden.</p> <p>Hamlin looked down upon the innocent‐looking little
fiend with a sort of disgust and contempt. “Thank you,” he said;
“gardens aren’t much in my line.”</p> <p>The little thing scowled at
this rebuff of her fascinations. But a sudden thought struck
Hamlin. “Yes, by the way,” he said, “I do take an interest in gardens
sometimes. Come and show me yours.”</p> <pb n="30"
xml:id="VAB7107-030"/> <p>Mildred slipped her arm through his—a
long‐legged, fair‐haired, pre‐Raphaelite child, in much‐darned
stockings and patched pinafore—Winnie, the second, a rounder, more
comfortable, cherubic beauty, seized his hand.  He let himself be led
along, among the prattle of the little one and the assumed shyness of
the elder, through the vineyard, where the tall, red‐tipped sorghum
brooms stood among the trailing pumpkins and the tufts of fennel, to a
small grove behind the house, in whose shade were four little raked‐up
spaces, with drooping marigolds and zinnias stuck into the earth, and
small box sprigs.</p> <p>“This is my garden!” cried Winnie, dragging
him along, and pointing to the melancholy little patch. “I have
marigolds, and sunflowers, and red beans and potatoes.”</p> <p>“And
this is mine,” said Mildred, raising her big blue eyes. “I call it the
garden of Acrasia; because mamma told us once about Sir Guyon—”</p>
<p>“Won’t you give us anything to buy seeds<pb n="31"
xml:id="VAB7107-031"/> with; we want tomato seeds,” clamoured
Winnie.</p> <p>“Hush, Winnie! I wonder you’re not ashamed!” cried
Mildred.</p> <p>“They are very good sort of gardens,” said Hamlin,
fishing in his waistcoat for loose silver, while the children looked
at him with beaming eyes; “here—I hope your tomatoes may prosper and
prove eatable.”</p> <p>Then he suddenly turned to Mildred. “Come
here,” he ordered, “I want to speak to you ;” and he sat down on a
stone bench under a plane‐tree, in which the cicala was sawing away
with all his might.</p> <p>Mildred stood in front of him, wondering,
half hoping for the usual request that she should sit for an angel or
a fairy.</p> <p>“Look here,” said Hamlin, quietly; “I want to know how
you would feel if your papa had been in the habit of drinking too much
<foreign xml:lang="ita">acquavite</foreign>, and had shot himself
after trying to murder your mamma, and some nasty little girl blurted
it all out at breakfast to a perfect stranger?”</p> <pb n="32"
xml:id="VAB7107-032"/> <p>The child flushed with surprise and anger;
she looked as if she would have scratched Hamlin’s eyes out. But he
looked steadily in her face, and he was a stranger, a gentleman, a
man, and not her papa; circumstances which entirely overawed her. She
recovered her composure marvellously, and answered after a moment’s
reflection, “My papa is a gentleman, and Annina’s papa was a common
man —a <foreign xml:lang="ita">mascalzone</foreign>,”—with
considerable triumph at her dignified argument.</p> <p>“Your papa
<emph>is</emph> a gentleman,” replied Hamlin, sternly; “I have known
him long before you were born. But remember, if you say cruel things
which hurt people’s feelings, whether they be gentle people or
servants, however much your papa may be a gentleman, <emph>you</emph>
won’t be a lady.”</p> <p>And Hamlin left the little Perrys to muse
upon this moral truth. He felt quite excited; and when the excitement
had subsided, he felt quite astonished at himself. He could scarcely
realise that he himself had actually been<pb n="33"
xml:id="VAB7107-033"/> meddling in other people’s affairs, had been
reading a lesson to other people’s children, all about a little girl
saying offensive things to her nurse. It was so strange that it quite
humiliated him: he had first pushed his company on to a nursemaid, and
then, unasked, fought the nursemaid’s battle. This confounded Perry
household! Was it going to turn him also into a ridiculous caricature?
He went up‐stairs and wrote some business letters, and corrected a lot
of proof of his new book. Then he thought it would be pleasanter to
correct the remainder in the garden; so he brought down his
writing‐case, and established himself on the grass behind the
house. The first‐floor balcony and the roof projected a deep shade;
and on the high grass flickered shadows of plane‐trees and laurels, as
through their branches there flickered the pale‐blue sky. The swifts
flew round the eaves with sharp noise, the cicalas sawed in the trees;
all was profoundly peaceable. But suddenly, from the first‐floor
windows came a vague sound of<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7107-034"/>
childish sobbing, a confused murmur as if of consolation. Then a
pause, after which a well‐known voice arose shrill in glib
Italian.</p> <p>“Annina, how dare you distress the signorina Mildred?
How dare you say cruel things to my poor, poor sensitive child?”</p>
<p>“I have said nothing cruel to the signorina Mildred,” answered a
deep, quiet voice; “the signorina Mildred went to show her garden to
Mr Hamlin, and then came back crying. I asked her what had happened,
but she refused to tell me.  I have nothing to do with her tears.”</p>
<p>“How dare you tell such an untruth?” shrieked Mrs Perry. “The
signorina Mildred said something about your father at breakfast, and
you, like a little viper, turned round upon the poor little
darling. She is nearly in hysterics! You little serpent!”</p> <p>“It
is one of Miss Mildred’s usual lies,” answered the other voice
calmly—“una delle solite bugíe.”</p> <p>Hamlin had been admitted too
much into<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7107-035"/> confidence. He took up his
writing things hastily, and removed to the furthest end of the garden,
out of reach of the dispute.</p> <p>This was the pretty result of his
interference! He had merely got this poor devil of a nursemaid into a
scrape. It was the fit punishment for his folly in going out of his
way to meddle with other folk. He was very much annoyed; he had been
dragged into a sordid woman’s squabble; Mrs Perry’s scolding had
seemed addressed to him. At the same time, he did feel indignant that
the girl should be treated in this fashion: such a splendid, queenly
creature slanged by a sentimental, æsthetic fishwife, as he defined
his hostess to himself.</p> <p>The return of Melton Perry interrupted
his reflections. Perry was quite astonished to find him up, and
extremely distressed at his having had no regular breakfast.</p>
<p>“You see,” he said, “Mrs Perry is very delicate—in short, scarcely
fit for any kind of household bother,—so that—”</p> <pb n="36"
xml:id="VAB7107-036"/> <p>“Oh,” answered Hamlin, “I had a capital
breakfast with your children.”</p> <p>Then they fell to talking of old
times; and little by little there emerged from out of the overworked,
henpecked Melton Perry of the present, the resemblance of the proud
and brilliant Melton Perry of the past.</p> <p>“Of course,” said
Perry, as they sat smoking in the sheltered studio—“of course I’m very
happy, and that sort of thing. My wife—well, she’s a little impetuous,
and I don’t always agree about her way of bringing up the children—but
there’s no saying that she isn’t an immensely superior kind of
woman. I don’t always agree with her, mind you; but she has the true
poetic temperament, and”—here he made an evident effort—“she keeps me
up to the mark with my work. I was always a lazy hound, you know, and
all that. In short, I know I’m quite a singularly fortunate
man. Nevertheless,—well, I tell you my frank opinion about matrimony:
never do it; the odds<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7107-037"/> are too
great. My own belief is, that, especially for an artist, it’s a
fellow’s ruin. Mine, you see, is an exceptional position. But if you
take my advice, old man, never marry.”</p> <p>“I don’t think there is
the faintest chance,” answered Hamlin. “Women have got to bore me long
ago: all that in my poems is mere recollections of the
past—descriptions of a myself which has long come to an end.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad of it,” replied Perry. “It is a foolish thing to get tied
to a woman.”</p> <p>“Foolish indeed!” thought Hamlin, looking from his
shabby, depressed old comrade, to the blazing sunsets and green
moonlights on the easels about them.</p> </div> <pb n="38"
xml:id="VAB7107-038"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p><hi>DURING</hi> luncheon, no mention was made of the nursemaid into
whose concerns Hamlin had that morning intruded; but at dinner,
Hamlin’s sense of the question being a sore one, and of being himself
mixed up in it, gave way before his curiosity to solve the riddle of
the strange‐type which had taken him so by surprise.</p> <p>“That is a
very strange‐looking girl you have in your service,” he remarked to
his hostess, over their grapes and thin wine.</p> <p>“The cook?” cried
Mrs Perry. “Isn’t she a divine creature? I call her Monna Lisa’s
younger sister.”</p> <p>“I don’t know your cook by sight,” he
answered. “I mean the other young woman they call Annina—”</p> <pb
n="39" xml:id="VAB7107-039"/> <p>Mrs Perry’s brow darkened.</p>
<p>“The nurse—or governess,—I don’t know exactly how to describe
her,—of your little girls.”</p> <p>“My children’s maid,” answered Mrs
Perry, with considerable emphasis. “Thank heaven, my children have
never had and shall never have any other nurse or any other governess
than their own mother.”</p> <p>“Well, now, Julia,” remonstrated her
husband, “I think, you know, that’s pushing it a little too far.”</p>
<p>“My children shall never learn anything from a menial,” insisted
Mrs Perry, “neither to walk bodily, nor morally, nor intellectually,
as long as I am alive.”</p> <p>“Good heavens!” thought Hamlin, “what a
bandy‐legged family they are likely to turn out!”</p> <p>“I suppose
you mean Annie,” said Perry. “Yes, she’s a good girl, and a
good‐looking girl.”</p> <p>“You are mad, Melton,” cried Mrs Perry,
“with your idea of goodness and good looks!”</p> <pb n="40"
xml:id="VAB7107-040"/> <p>“I think her extraordinarily good‐looking,”
put in Hamlin, enjoying the authority of his own verdict.</p> <p>“I
always told you so,” replied Perry.</p> <p>“When I say good‐looking,”
corrected Hamlin, “I don’t mean it at all in the ordinary sense. There
are dozens of Italian girls five times as pretty as that girl, and I
daresay most people don’t think her at all attractive.”</p> <p>“Yes,”
burst out Mrs Perry, “vulgar minds and eyes never appreciate the
higher beauty. They see only the body.”</p> <p>“This is exactly a
question of the body,” went on Hamlin. “That girl is one of the most
singular types I have ever come across. She is like some of
Michaelangelo’s women, but even stranger—a superb creature.”</p>
<p>The revelation of her maid’s beauty by so great an authority as
Hamlin quite dazzled and delighted Mrs Perry.</p> <p>“All our servants
are handsome,” she said; “the cook’s the finest Leonardo da Vinci
type—when you see her you will want to do her<pb n="41"
xml:id="VAB7107-041"/> picture, Mr Hamlin, as Venus Mystica,” and Mrs
Melton Perry set her meagre features and wide‐opening mouth into a
mystic smile, intimating that she knew a great deal about Venus
Mystica, and her guest doubtless likewise.</p> <p>“And the footman”
. . . she went on.</p> <p>“Errand‐boy,” corrected Mr Perry, suddenly,
emboldened by his friend’s presence.</p> <p>“The footman is quite a
type of manly beauty—a young Hercules,—such a neck and shoulders and
arms—and a head like a cameo. I always make it a rule to engage only
handsome servants, because it spiritualises the minds of our children
to be brought up constantly surrounded by beautiful human forms.”</p>
<p>“I see,” answered Hamlin drily, entirely neglecting his opportunity
of making the usual reply to this remark—namely, that the young Perrys
were so abundantly provided with beautiful human form in the person of
their mother that any other was superfluous.</p> <p>“That girl you
noticed has rather a curious history,” said Perry.</p> <pb n="42"
xml:id="VAB7107-042"/> <p>“Indeed!” answered Hamlin;“she looks as if
she ought to have some sort of tragic past—a kind of Brynhilt or
Amazon.”</p> <p>“It’s tragic enough if you like, but it’s
unfortunately not at all poetical,” replied Perry.</p> <p>“There is
poetry in all suffering, Melton,” corrected his wife gravely.</p>
<p>“Well, this girl is the daughter of a Scotch mechanic, a very
clever fellow, I believe, who fell in love with the Italian maid of
some old friends of ours, and followed her to Italy. He got a very
good position in the docks at Spezia, but then the other chaps
caballed against him, and made him lose his place. They had to live
from hand to mouth for a long while, doing odd jobs for the railway
company; he squandered his money also on inventions, so, little by
little, he and his wife and children got into great distress. Then he
took to drinking, poor devil! (I’m sure I should have done so long
before;) and one day that he had again been done out of a place by
some Italian scoundrel<pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7107-043"/>, he tried to
throw his wife out of the window, and then shot himself. It was a
dreadful business.”</p> <p>“He was a great republican, poor dear,”
added Mrs Perry. “I’m a republican too, a socialist—quite a dreadful
creature, Mr Hamlin.”</p> <p>“What became of the wife and children ?”
asked Hamlin.</p> <p>“The children had all died by this time, except
Annie; and the poor wife was quite broken in health. There was a
nephew of the husband’s, a Scotch lad, quite a boy, who was awfully
plucky and worked for them for some time. Then the widow died; and an
old friend of ours, old Miss Curzon, the famous singer that had
been—perhaps you may have heard of her—took Annie into her house.”</p>
<p>“Darling Miss Curzon!” exclaimed Mrs Perry. “She was the noblest
woman that ever lived. How she loved me! I always say that I lost my
voice—I had a lovely voice before my marriage—when dear darling Miss
Curzon died.”</p> <pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7107-044"/> <p>“Miss Curzon
<emph>was</emph> an excellent old woman,” went on Perry: “she took
Annie when she was eleven, and kept her in her house and educated her
till her own death two years ago;” and Perry sighed, as he peeled a
hard white peach.</p> <p>“Then I said to my husband, ‘Perry, this
child is a legacy to us from our dearest friend,’” went on Mrs Perry,
solemnly; “‘we are not rich, but Heaven will send us enough for our
children and this child; and if it don’t, why, we must do
without.’”</p> <p>“So she has been with you ever since?”</p> <p>“Yes,”
answered Perry, sharply; “and I should like her to remain for the
children’s sake, only that I feel the girl ought to look out for some
better place.” And he turned rather gloomily to his wife.</p> <p>Mrs
Perry answered his look with one of sweet and ineffable
astonishment. She naturally viewed all her property, servants,
children, husband, &amp;c., as emanations from herself—that is to say,
from perfection, and consequently as<pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7107-045"/>
more perfect than other folk’s property, servants, children, husbands,
although occasionally falling short of this ineffable origin; and she
accepted, with alacrity and pleasure, the belief in the transcendent
beauty of the nursemaid whom she had shrieked at only a few hours
before. She was quite reconciled to her, evidently.</p> <p>“And what
is this girl’s name?” asked Hamlin.</p> <p>“Anne,” answered Perry—“
Anne Brown.”</p> </div> <pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7107-046"/> <div
type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER V.</head> <p><hi>THUS</hi> it came about
that Walter Hamlin, of Wotton Hall, pre‐Raphaelite poet and painter,
made acquaintance with Anne Brown, nurse, or as Mrs Perry defined it,
children’s maid at the Villa Arnolfini.</p> <p>The whole of the two
following days, Hamlin neither saw nor particularly remembered the
strange girl whose champion he had constituted himself against the
little Perrys. An old chaise, with an older pony, was produced from
the neighbouring farmhouse, and Mr and Mrs Melton Perry took it by
turns to drive their guest along the dusty roads to the old town of
Lucca, to various villas, and other sights of the neighbourhood. In
the evening Perry led his friend out for a stroll among the vineyards
and<pb n="47" xml:id="VAB7107-047"/> the olives, and across the low
hills covered with bright green pines and dark cypresses. At the end
of the third day, Hamlin, while smoking after dinner with his host,
insinuated to Perry that he really thought he must be pushing on to
Florence. A look of blank terror overspread poor Perry’s face.</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” he cried—“don’t say that; don’t leave me in the lurch
yet.”</p> <p>“You see,” said Hamlin, hypocritically, “I intend going
to America; and I really think I ought to do a little work before
leaving Italy.”</p> <p>“What sort of work?”</p> <p>“Why, I suppose—I
think—I ought to take this opportunity of working a little at one of
my pictures for the next Grosvenor.”</p> <p>“Which picture?” asked
Perry, eagerly.</p> <p>“I really scarcely know. I suppose I ought to
be making some studies for Circe and the child Comus.”</p> <p>“Child
Comus!” exclaimed Perry. “Why, I’ve the very thing you want here at
hand.<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7107-048"/> Such a Comus for you! There’s
not a model in all Florence will suit you so well; it’s the farmer’s
son. Such legs, and such a chest!”</p> <p>“I don’t intend doing him
naked,” answered Hamlin, whose strong point was not anatomy.</p>
<p>“Naked or not, he’s what you want. The head, since you don’t care
for legs and chest. You shall have him to‐morrow; and you can work
much better here than in that swelter at Florence—”</p> <p>“In short,”
burst out poor Perry, “don’t leave me yet, old fellow. You don’t know
what it is for me to have you here—I feel quite another man. It seems
to me as if I were ten years younger. The fact is, don’t you know, a
man’s never the same when once married; it’s a weight round his
neck. Don’t go away yet, dear old Watty, for the sake of auld lang
syne.”</p> <p>Hamlin could not help being touched by the way in which
his old friend threw himself on his compassion. Poor old Perry! How<pb
n="49" xml:id="VAB7107-049"/> dreadfully dreary and broken‐spirited he
must be when all alone with that awful wife of his!</p> <p>“Well, I’m
willing enough to stay, if you’ll keep me,” answered Hamlin.</p>
<p>“That’s right!” cried Perry, squeezing his hand. “Keep me from
growing into a turnip for a little longer, for goodness’ sake.”</p>
<p>So the next morning the farmer’s boy was sent for, and Hamlin
began, in a desultory way, to make some studies for his picture. The
fact was, he was so utterly indifferent as to all his own movements,
that it was an absolute relief to be pinned down to one place by his
old friend. Accordingly he unpacked his things, and prepared to stay
at the Villa Arnolfini until the Perrys should themselves return to
Florence in October.</p> <p>Little by little he got to arrange his day
so as to avoid as far as possible the dreaded <foreign
xml:lang="fre">tête‐à‐tête</foreign> with Mrs Perry; spending the
morning lying on the sear grass or the fallen fir‐needles under Melton
Perry’s sketching umbrella; and<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7107-050"/>
locking himself up during the afternoon with the pretext of his
picture.  Locking himself up, and sometimes unlocking the door and
letting the lank and limp lady come and sit in his improvised studio,
entertaining him with her views on life, poetry, art, love; and
invariably representing herself as the devoted slave of a kind of
fierce and gloomy lover‐husband of the Othello description. During
this first week of his stay at the Villa Arnolfini, Hamlin did not
lose sight of the Perrys’ strange nursemaid. The girl’s exotic, and,
so to speak, tragic style of beauty, had made a great impression upon
him, but a sort of impression such as only a temper entirely artistic
could receive. He was interested in Anne Brown, but not in the whole
of Anne Brown. He wished to see more of her, but to see more only of
her superb physical appearance, and of that sullen, silent, almost
haughty manner which accompanied it. As to anything there might be,
intellectual or moral, behind this beautiful and dramatic creature, he
did not<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7107-051"/> care in the least, and would
much rather have seen nothing of it. So far, she was striking,
admirable, picturesque, consistent; further details might merely spoil
the effect. Hence it was that, although he made several sketches of
her head from memory, and although he rhymed the first half of a
sonnet upon the strange fate which had, to put it in plain prose,
given the beauty of an Amazon to a nursemaid, he instinctively
abstained from seeking in any way to renew the acquaintance which he
had made that first morning. The picturesque and imaginative figure
was just in the right light and at the right distance,—a single
movement, and all the picturesqueness and strangeness might
vanish. Walter Hamlin had had but too many instances of the melancholy
results of trying to approach and become familiar with creatures who
had caught his æsthetic and poetic fancy. He often saw her hurrying
(if she might ever be said to hurry, for there was something
wonderfully measured about her) to and fro, filling up,<pb n="52"
xml:id="VAB7107-052"/> it would seem, the gaps in Mrs Perry’s rather
theoretical housekeeping; and sometimes, passing through the
ground‐floor passage, he would also see her ironing, like that first
time, or laboriously presiding over the little Perrys’ lessons; for it
appeared that Mrs Perry’s intellectual guidance of her children
consisted in telling them the plots of novels and repeating choice
poetry, leaving such mechanical matters as reading and writing to what
she called a menial. And even more frequently Hamlin would meet her
taking the children for a walk, or sitting in the vineyard sewing or
reading, while they built houses of leaves and sticks, and cooked
dinners of maize‐grains and unripe figs.  Hamlin scarcely ever spoke
to her; and if the children forced him to remain and examine their
houses or their dinners, he would watch the girl, but without the
slightest desire of entering into conversation. He wished to know only
as much as he could see of her. But this much which he saw inspired
him with a kind of respect,—a respect not for Anne<pb n="53"
xml:id="VAB7107-053"/> Brown, nursemaid or nursery‐governess of Mrs
Melton Perry, but respect for a beautiful and solemn kind of Valkyr or
Amazon; for there is no doubt that to certain temperaments not given
to respect for social distinctions or religious institutions, or even
the kind of moral characteristics held to be worthy of respect by
ordinary folk, there is something actually venerable in some kinds of
beauty: the man respects the unknown woman as a goddess, and respects
himself for having discovered her divinity. So that, habitually and
instinctively, Hamlin displayed towards the young woman a degree of
courtesy which astonished the little Perrys, who had seen young men
flirt with various of their mother’s carefully selected beautiful
servants, but never treat them, as Miss Mildred expressed it, as if
they were funerals passing. All of which distant respect Anne Brown
received coldly, as if it were a matter of course; showing
astonishment only on one occasion, when Hamlin answered, being
requested to lift little Winnie into the branches<pb n="54"
xml:id="VAB7107-054"/> of an olive‐tree—“You must first ask permission
of Miss Brown.”</p> <p>The girl looked up from her work, and fixed her
great greyish‐blue eyes upon him in wonder. No one had ever called her
Miss Brown before.</p> <p>Thus things might have continued, and Hamlin
have left the Villa Arnolfini with only a few lines of a sonnet on the
fly‐leaf of his ‘Vita Nuova’—a few scratched‐out sketches of a face
with strange, curling full lips, and masses of wiry hair, in his
sketchbook—and a daily fainter remembrance of Mrs Perry’s nurse; when
one day he took it into his head to construct a kind of medieval
costume for his peasant‐boy model, and accordingly went to Mrs Perry
for assistance in sewing together the various shreds of old brocade
and satin which he had bought at Lucca, the various bits of
weather‐stained cotton which he had obtained by barter from the
peasants. Mrs Perry, lying languidly on a sofa in her dusty boudoir,
littered over with<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7107-055"/> books and reviews,
afforded him a variety of valuable pieces of information upon
harmonies of colours and the magic of folds; but when it came to
practical tailoring, she smiled with reproachful gentleness, and,
clapping her hands, called out for Annie. Annie—that is to say, Anne
Brown—emerged from an adjacent room, silent and sullen as usual; but
when she understood that the job was for Hamlin, she seemed suddenly
to develop a certain interest in it. The pieces of stuff were spread
out on the drawing‐room table, and Hamlin proceeded to explain what
manner of garment he wanted, Mrs Perry joining in from the next room
with various bewildering instructions. The girl immediately
understood; but the piece of work was complicated and tiresome. The
stuff had several times to be sewn together, tried on to the live
model, and then taken down‐stairs to be altered.</p> <p>“Won’t you sit
down and do it here, Miss Brown?” Hamlin at length suggested.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated for a moment, and then<pb n="56"
xml:id="VAB7107-056"/> settled herself to sew at the table of the
empty drawing‐room. Hamlin went into the studio next door, and tried
to draw a little; but he felt himself attracted to go and watch the
girl as she leaned over the table, or sat with her beautiful head
bending over her sewing. Every now and then she looked up to ask him
some question: a regal, tragic, out‐of‐our‐world, almost weird face,
the contrast of which with her prosiac questions about seams and tucks
was almost comic.</p> <p>Hamlin looked at her as he might have looked
at a beautiful cathedral front; and he began to feel that kind of
anticipated regret at the thought of losing sight of something
beautiful and rare, that almost painful desire to keep at least some
durable likeness of it, which, in former years, had often tormented
him in the midst of the enjoyment of lovely things. He did not see his
way to introducing Anne Brown into any picture; nay, he perhaps did
not even think of his work; but he determined that he must have a
likeness of<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7107-057"/> her to take away with
him. Accordingly, that same evening, as he was seated with the Perrys
in front of the villa, watching the stars gradually lighting
themselves in the bright metallic blue sky, Hamlin suddenly turned to
his hostess, and asked her whether she thought it would be possible
for him to make a sketch of Anne Brown.</p> <p>“I may want her for a
picture some day,” he added, half hypocritically.</p> <p>Mrs Perry’s
enthusiasm was immediately kindled.</p> <p>“Oh !” she exclaimed,
“paint a picture of her as the Witch of Atlas, with a red cloak and
red roses all about her, and a background of cactuses and aloes all
twisting and writhing, and looking as if they gibbered. Do paint her
like that, dear Mr Hamlin—and Mildred and Winnie will do for attendant
spirits. Begin to‐morrow—you shall have her to sit to you all day; and
she has such lovely arms and shoulders, you <emph>must</emph> paint
her in some kind of dress that will show them.”</p> <pb n="58"
xml:id="VAB7107-058"/> <p>“I think it’s rather cool of you to promise
Annie as a sitter in that way,” put in Melton Perry—“especially with
so few clothes on, Julia.”</p> <p>“Why not?” asked Mrs Perry, in
astonishment. “If she is beautiful she must be painted. She shall
begin sitting to‐morrow morning.”</p> <p>“She shan’t do anything of
the kind!” exclaimed Perry, suddenly. “I don’t see at all what right
we have to dispose of her. We pay her wages as a servant for our
children, not as a model for our visitors.”</p> <p>“I never dreamed of
Miss Brown being in any way compelled to sit,” remonstrated Hamlin,
rather indignantly. “I only wanted your assistance in asking whether
she would.”</p> <p>“Of course she will,” insisted Mrs Perry. “Why, I
wonder what great hardship there is in sitting for one’s likeness?
Haven’t I done it hundreds of times?  When a woman is beautiful, it’s
her duty; that’s what I was always told.”</p> <p>“It may be the duty
of a lady, Julia,” answered<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7107-059"/> Mr Perry,
gloomily, “and it may be yours; but it isn’t the duty of a servant
girl—the difference lies in that.”</p> <p>“Well,” retorted Mrs Perry,
angrily, “I think you don’t show much appreciation of the honour of
having one of the greatest of living painters in our house, Perry. I
do, and I shall see to his having the proper model.”</p> <p>“Please, I
entreat you, dear Mrs Perry,” cried Hamlin,“ do let the matter go—it
really is of no consequence; and, indeed, it would be in the last
degree distasteful to me to have an unwilling sitter.”</p> <p>“You
shall have a willing one, Mr Hamlin;” and Mrs Perry walked off with
dignity.</p> <p>Melton Perry suddenly shook off his languor, and
started after his wife.</p> <p>“Julia,” he cried, “do leave it to
me—I’ll speak to Annie—only <emph>do</emph> leave it to me.”</p> <p>“I
see no reason for this,” she answered.</p> <p>“Then I shall speak to
Annie at once,” replied Perry.</p> <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7107-060"/>
<p>“There’s been far too much of this turning of servants into models
in this house,” he said, turning to Hamlin. “Mrs Perry can’t be got to
see that it isn’t at all the right sort of thing. I don’t mind so much
with the others, for I suppose they’re a parcel of sluts; but Annie is
another matter. I don’t mind it’s being you, you know, old fellow; but
I object to the principle. Annie! Annie! I want to speak to you a
moment,” and Mr Perry went into the house.</p> <p>After a moment he
returned.</p> <p>“I’ve spoken to her, Hamlin,” he said. “I told her
that she was just what you wanted for the Lady Guenevere or the Lady
of the Lake, or some lady or other—all a lie; but you see I didn’t
wish her to know it was merely because she’s handsome. I told her she
was like a portrait of one of these persons.  Please don’t tell her
she’s not. I really expected she’d refuse; and I said to her, ‘Annie,
mind you don’t let the mistress force you into sitting; don’t do it to
please anybody.’ I’m<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7107-061"/> really quite
surprised, for she’s such a very reserved girl always; but then she is
an obliging creature too, and I think she’ll do more to please me than
perhaps my wife, because I always let her understand that this isn’t a
good place at all, and that she ought to try for another. Well, she
says she’ll sit; but not till after the ironing is done in the
morning. I proposed half‐past nine—will that do?”</p> <p>“Thank you,”
answered Hamlin, putting his hand on Perry’s shoulder; “you’re a good
old creature, Perry.”</p> </div> <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7107-062"/>
<div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> <p><hi>HAMLIN</hi> did
not succeed in doing much that first sitting. He had thought that Anne
Brown’s head would be an easy one to sketch; but it proved just the
reverse. Those salient and outlandish features, which he had thought
he could catch in half an hour, were turned into caricature by the
slightest exaggeration, and exaggeration was almost inevitable. He
made several beginnings, and scratched them all out; and at the end of
a couple of hours he felt that he positively could not go on; he had
become quite fidgety over his work.</p> <p>“I have bungled
everything,” he said at last, rising, “and kept you here for
nothing,<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7107-063"/> Miss Brown. The fact is,
that you are far more difficult to draw than I expected.”</p> <p>He
felt very humiliated at having, as it were, to confess himself a bad
artist before such a model.</p> <p>“Try again,” suggested Perry. “I
daresay Annie will sit for you again—won’t you, Annie?”</p> <p>“If Mr
Hamlin wishes me to sit, certainly,” answered the girl simply.</p>
<p>“She <emph>is</emph> confoundedly difficult to draw,” said Hamlin,
when she had turned her back.</p> <p>“She’s difficult because she’s a
kind of mystery,” explained Perry. “I’ve felt it ever since we have
had her. One thinks there must be something behind that face, and yet
it seems to be a mere blank. My belief is, that people of this
condition of life often have very little character—at least none in
particular developed. Because, after all, it’s talking and jawing
about things which don’t matter a pin that develops our character. The
people who have no opportunity for that remain quite<pb n="64"
xml:id="VAB7107-064"/> without character, until some day they are
forced to choose whether they’ll be self‐sacrificing creatures or mean
pigs.”</p> <p>“There’s something in that,” answered Hamlin, tearing up
his abortive sketches in a huff; “but it <emph>is</emph> hard that a
man should be unable to copy the shape of a handsome face as he would
copy the shape of a handsome vase, without wondering what there may be
inside.”</p> <p>The fact was, that the utter silence of his model, and
his own utter silence, except when begging her to turn a little more
in this direction or that, made Hamlin nervous. He had, of course,
sketched and painted scores of people who had sat as utterly silent as
Anne Brown, but then Anne Brown was not a model of that
kind. Indifferent as he felt towards the hidden reality of this girl,
he was, nevertheless, fully conscious that she was a personality,
something much more than a mere form; or rather, the form itself was
suggestive of something more. It would be an easy thing to have to
sketch Michaelangelo’s Dawn, or<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7107-065"/> his
Delphic Sibyl become living flesh, in utter silence with those eyes
fixed upon one. If only he could speak to her, or make her speak, he
was persuaded it would be much easier; but for some unaccountable
reason it seemed impossible to set up a conversation. One morning
accident came to Hamlin’s assistance. Strolling about after breakfast,
he found in a corner of the vineyard, where the trampled grass
revealed the recent presence of the little Perrys, a couple of books
carefully buried under a heap of dead leaves just where he chanced to
walk. The children had evidently hidden them out of mischief. One was
a cheap copy of Dante, with notes—the other an Italian
grammar. Turning to the fly‐leaf he found, written in a curious hand,
a stiff imitation of English tradesmen’s writing, the name “Anne
Brown.” He wiped the books, for they were wet with dew, and deposited
them upon the window‐sill of the nursery. At half‐past nine the girl
came to the studio. She had been sitting a little while, when
Hamlin,<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7107-066"/> bending over his work,
suddenly broke the silence—</p> <p>“I find we have a common friend,
Miss Brown,” he said.</p> <p>The girl, without stirring, opened her
large eyes.</p> <p>“A common friend?” she asked, with a scarcely
perceptible agitation in her quiet manner; then added, “I suppose you
mean Mr Perry; I haven’t many friends now anywhere.”</p> <p>“Oh! this
is the friend of a great many people—thousands—besides ourselves, so
you need not feel jealous; his name is Dante.”</p> <p>“Indeed!”
answered Anne Brown, and relapsed into silence.</p> <p>But silence did
not suit Hamlin. “I found two books belonging to you in the vineyard
early this morning,” he continued; “and I put them on the nursery
window‐sill.”</p> <p>“Thank you,” replied Miss Brown, in her taciturn
manner; “I missed them last night.”</p> <p>“I was indiscreet enough to
wonder whether<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7107-067"/> you and I cared for
the same things in Dante,” pursued Hamlin; “so I ventured to open the
book. I found you had marked the passage about Provenzano.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Miss Brown.</p> <p>“How is it that you marked
Provenzano, and did not mark Ugolino, I wonder?”</p> <p>“I don’t care
about Ugolino. He was a traitor.”</p> <p>“Do you consider that
traitors ought to be starved to death?” asked Hamlin, with a
smile.</p> <p>“I don’t think any one ought to be starved to death,”
she answered very seriously; “it is too dreadful. But I don’t care
about Ugolino, because he was a traitor; and the Archbishop was a
traitor too. There is no one to be glad or sorry about.”</p> <p>“And
Francesca da Rimini? Do you find there is nothing to care for or be
sorry about in her?”</p> <p>A faint redness welled up under the
uniform brown pallor of Anne Brown’s face.</p> <pb n="68"
xml:id="VAB7107-068"/> <p>“The husband was quite right,” she said,
after a pause.</p> <p>“You are very severe,” remarked Hamlin—“much
more severe than Dante. He was sorry for them.”</p> <p>“They were
quite happy,” she answered. “They did not mind being killed; they did
not mind being driven about in the wind, of course”—then she stopped
short suddenly.</p> <p>“Why of course?” and Hamlin went on scraping at
his pencil.</p> <p>“Because I don’t think one would mind, if people
cared for one, being driven about in the wind like that. Lots of
people have been driven about in revolutions, and put into dungeons
together, and so on. If they had put papa in prison, I should have
wanted to go in with him,”—for once she spoke with a certain amount of
vehemence.</p> <p>Hamlin looked up from his pencil‐cutting. The
expression which he suddenly met in her face made him feel that at
last he had what he wanted. It was a curious mixture, possible<pb
n="69" xml:id="VAB7107-069"/> only in those strange features, of a
kind of passionate effort with dogged determination: the head a little
lifted, cheeks and lips firmly set; but in the eyes, and even in the
curl of the close‐set lips, a sort of strain, as of a person trying to
inhale a larger amount of air, or to take in a larger sight. In a
second it was gone.</p> <p>“That is what I want!” thought Hamlin; “the
Amazon or Valkyr—as I thought.”</p> <p>“Tell me why you care for
Provenzano,” he went on, now much more interested in his work
again.</p> <p>“Because he was so proud, and did not like to do humble
things,” she answered; “and yet he begged in the streets for a ransom
for his friend.”</p> <p>She showed no desire to say more, and Hamlin
was now engrossed in his work.  They exchanged but a few trivial
remarks during the rest of the sitting. The girl seemed to have
contracted a habit of silence, to break through which required a
positive effort. When the<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7107-070"/> sitting had
come to an end, Hamlin asked whether she could possibly give him
another.</p> <p>She hesitated. “If Mrs Perry wishes it, of course,”
she answered.</p> <p>“Excuse me,” corrected Hamlin. “Mrs Perry’s
consent may be necessary for you; but for me, the sitting depends upon
your wishes, Miss Brown.”</p> <p>“I don’t care one way or another,”
she answered hurriedly.</p> <p>Mrs Perry of course gave her
consent.</p> <p>She had carefully collected and pieced the scattered
remnants of yesterday’s abortive sketches, and Hamlin found her
pasting them on to cardboard.</p> <p>“Do let me keep them, dear Mr
Hamlin,” cried Mrs Perry; “they are the most precious things I
possess.”</p> <p>“They are horrible rubbish;” and Hamlin rudely tore
them to shreds. “If you want something of mine, I will make you a
sketch of little Winnie—only please don’t keep these fearful
things.”</p> <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7107-071"/> <p>“Thank you, thank
you <emph>so</emph> much!” she exclaimed—“but oh, mayn’t I keep this?
it is such a lovely head!”</p> <p>“It’s the head of Miss Brown,” he
answered angrily. “You don’t care for it much on her shoulders,—why
should you care for it on my paper—an abominable caricature? Really, I
must be permitted to tear it up”—and he tore it into a heap of little
pieces.</p> <p>The next day but one he had another sitting from Anne
Brown; and he was so pleased with his drawing, that he begged for
permission to finish it in colours. During these additional sittings
there was not much conversation.  The Dante topic was perfectly worn
to shreds, till at last it seemed as if it could be made to go no
further. In despair, Hamlin remembered the Italian grammar which he
had picked up together with the Dante.</p> <p>“What do you want with
an Italian grammer?” he asked. “You surely don’t require to study it
yourself, Miss Brown?”</p> <p>“I want to teach some day,” she
answered.</p> <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7107-072"/> <p>“Do you mean to
teach the Perry children?”</p> <p>“Oh no—to teach, to be a daily
governess, what we call a <foreign xml:lang="ita">parlatrice</foreign>
here. It is not difficult. The lessons are all conversation. Many
English ladies want those sort of lessons. I know a girl, the daughter
of Mrs Perry’s dressmaker, who gives ten lessons every day, and and
gets two francs a lesson.”</p> <p>“Ten lessons a‐day! But that’s
fearful. What awful slavery! Surely you don’t want to do that?”</p>
<p>“I wish I could. I should be so happy.”</p> <p>“Then you want to
leave the Perrys?”</p> <p>“I want to give up being a servant.”</p>
<p>Hamlin paused, and looked at this superb and regal creature. He did
not know what to say.</p> <p>“You don’t care for children?” he asked
at random.</p> <p>“I don’t know. I don’t care for these children,” she
answered bluntly.</p> <p>“I thought women always liked children.”</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly.</p> <pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7107-073"/> <p>“Oh,”
she said, “children are worse sometimes than grown people; and then
one can’t resent it, or answer bad words, or strike them, just because
they are children.”</p> <p>“Then you think you would prefer being a
teacher of Italian?”</p> <p>“Oh yes, I must become that some day; I
study when I have a little time. A teacher talks with ladies, and
talks about all sorts of things.”</p> <p>“How do you mean—about all
sorts of things?”</p> <p>“About things—which are not things to eat, or
mend, or clean,—about books, and places, and people.”</p> <p>Hamlin
could not help smiling. “Is that such a rare pleasure?” he asked,
thinking not of the girl with whom he was talking, but of those weary
æsthetic discussions which he had left behind him in London.</p>
<p>“Miss Curzon used to talk about books to me—and about music,
sometimes,” said the girl. “She made me read Shakespeare with
her. That is long, long ago.”</p> <pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7107-074"/>
<p>“And since then. Do you never talk about such things?”</p>
<p>“Never.”</p> <p>“Never?”</p> <p>Anne Brown raised her eyes
quietly. “Never, except with you, sir.”</p> <p>Hamlin did not
answer.</p> <p>Towards the end of the sitting, he suddenly looked
up.</p> <p>“Have you ever read the ‘Vita Nuova,’ Miss Brown?” he
asked.</p> <p>“What’s the ‘Vita Nuova’?”</p> <p>“It is a little book
by Dante, in prose and verse, telling how he met Beatrice, and then
how she died. It is much more beautiful than the ‘Divina
Commedia.’”</p> <p>She looked incredulous.</p> <p>“Is it more
beautiful than Bertran del Bornio, where he carried his head like a
lantern? Or Bocca degli Abati, where they all change into snakes? Or
Cacciaguida when he prophesies about Dante’s exile?”</p> <p>“It is
quite different—all about beautiful things, and love.”</p> <pb n="75"
xml:id="VAB7107-075"/> <p>“I don’t care for that.”</p> <p>“You must
read it some day, though.”</p> <p>Miss Brown was silent, and relapsed
into her usual sullen appearance.</p> <p>“I say, Hamlin, old fellow,”
said Perry, as they walked up and down in the garden that evening, “do
you care to see the festival at Lucca to‐morrow?  I’m going to take
the children in for a treat, and I shall take Annie too—for she never
gets any amusement, poor girl. I’ve hired a waggonette—will you be of
the party?”</p> <p>“Will you let me think about it, Perry? I don’t
much go in for festivals.”</p> <p>“This is a picturesque affair—really
worth seeing.”</p> <p>“By the way,” asked Hamlin, “I have nearly
finished my sketch of Miss Brown, and I should like—I suppose I
ought—to make her some little present.”</p> <p>“I wouldn’t,” answered
Melton Perry sharply; “she’s an odd girl, and you might just hurt her
feelings. You see her father was a republican, and that sort of thing,
so she’s got<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7107-076"/> all sorts of notions
about equality and so forth. Awful bosh, of course, but still I think
it’s as well she should have them as not.”</p> <p>“I didn’t mean any
money,” said Hamlin, feeling himself grow red at the mere thought.</p>
<p>“Then, if you will run the risk, give her some school‐books. You
know she wants to set up as a teacher. Grammars—that sort of
thing.”</p> <p>Hamlin made a gesture of disgust.</p> <p>“Horrible!—to
give her grammars!”</p> <p>“It’s what she wants.”</p> <p>“Why, it
would seem—well—it would be like encouraging her to become a daily
governess.”</p> <p>“That’s just what I wish to do.”</p> <p>Hamlin did
not answer. The idea of Anne Brown giving lessons at two francs the
hour jarred upon him.</p> </div> <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7107-077"/>
<div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER VII.</head> <p><hi>EARLY</hi> the
following morning Hamlin was awakened by the wheels of the waggonette
and the bells of the horses. Then came the excited voices of children;
the sound of slammed doors and precipitate steps on the stairs; and
finally the rattle and jingle of departure. He had declined being one
of the boisterous expedition to Lucca, for he detested children in
general, and the little Perrys in particular; and a day in the empty
house (for Mrs Perry was going to see some friends at a neighbouring
villa) had seemed to him delightful. He opened his shutters and saw,
in the crisp pale‐blue morning, the carriage sweeping round the corner
of a narrow lane, the children’s hats, Anne Brown’s red shawl, the
coachman’s grey coat, brush rapidly along a tall box hedge.<pb n="78"
xml:id="VAB7107-078"/> If there was a thing Hamlin hated more than
another, it was a holiday, a crowd, a lot of people on a jaunt.</p>
<p>After breakfast he went to the studio and sat down before his
sketches of Miss Brown. They were unsatisfactory, but they were as
good as he could hope to make them. He had fancied that a coloured
sketch of her head would be all that he could possibly want; but he
now recognised that, after all, the head, beautiful and singular as it
was, was yet the least part of the matter. It was the girl’s gait, her
way of carrying her head and neck, her movements when at work, her
postures when in repose—a number of things of which that head gave no
indication, and which, indeed, it was difficult to render in painting,
since it was all movement. He had scribbled a few lines—just
fragmentary metaphors and scraps of description—suggested to him by
Anne Brown, and wondered what use he would make of them; indeed, what
use he could make of Anne Brown altogether. Here was a<pb n="79"
xml:id="VAB7107-079"/> splendid model, a splendid heroine, but he was
in the mood neither for painting nor for poetry writing. He put a
background of dark bay trees to one of his sketches, and then
regretted having put it in at all. He no longer felt inclined to work;
and, all of a sudden, an unaccountable fancy struck him to follow the
holiday‐makers—to go quietly into town—to see them, without, perhaps,
letting himself be seen.</p> <p>The sun was already high as he walked,
or rather waded, along the dusty road, with its garlands of
dust‐engrained vines hanging from tree to tree on either side; its
dust‐stifled marsh‐flowers in the ditch; its white farmhouses, and
white stone heaps, white upon white, brilliant, relentlessly white,
under the deep blue autumn sky. Before him the bullock‐carts, with
sleepy drivers prostrate on their back, moved in a white cloud; a
whirlwind of dust was raised by every cariole, heavily laden with
singing and yelling peasants, which dashed past. Within sight of the
rampart trees, like a pleasant oasis of leafage in<pb n="80"
xml:id="VAB7107-080"/> the treeless green desert of the town, the
crowd of vehicles of all sorts began. Under the red brick gate, with
its statue of Justice and motto “Libertas,” there was a perfect block
of carts, gigs, bullocks, horses, and screaming country folk. Hamlin
wriggled through, and slipped along in the scant shade of the narrower
streets—empty and desolate on that holiday—ribbons of brilliant light
cut into, bordered by the black shadows of overhanging roofs and
balconies. A great buzz of voices came from the square of the
cathedral; peasants and townsfolk elbowing about, people at booths
yelling their wares, boys screeching on whistles and trumpets,
cathedral bell tolling, and all the neighbouring church bells
clattering and jangling. From the windows of the blackened palaces
fluttered strips of crimson and yellow brocade; across the street,
from balcony to balcony, and from twisted iron torchholder to twisted
iron bridle‐ring, were slung garlands of coloured lamps for the
evening’s illumination; and in the<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7107-081"/>
midst of all rose the cathedral front, its tiers and tiers of twisted
and sculptured pillarets, with the massive grey belfry soaring by its
side into the high blue sky. Hamlin pushed his way in at one of the
side gates; a rolling of organs, and quavering of choir voices, and
clash of brass instruments; a hot mouthful of heavy, incense‐laden
atmosphere; a compact moving human mass beneath the Gothic arches;
beams of light flickering among clouds of dust, and incense and taper
smoke high in the arched nave; constellations of lights on altar, and
organ‐loft, and chandelier, yellow specks in the mid‐day twilight of
the cathedral; something tawdry, hushed, unbreathable, and yet
impressive and beautiful.</p> <p>Hamlin gradually made his way to the
side of the altar‐steps. This part of the cathedral was full of
women—provincial great ladies, and shopkeepers’ wives and daughters in
their Sunday clothes, brilliant caricatures of last year’s Paris
fashions—close packed together on reserved seats, enjoying the
incense, the<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7107-082"/> lights, the music, the
holiness of the ceremony, the clothes of their neighbours, the
appealing glances of the young men in elaborate silk and alpaca summer
coats, with artistically combed‐up heads of hair, sucking their canes
all about the altar. Hamlin’s entry, however quiet, was soon
perceived, and the eyes of all this womankind were fixed upon the
sight, rare in that country town, of an Englishman; and white silk
bonnets, and black lace veils, and big red fans, and fuzzy yellow and
smooth black heads, leant towards each other,—while questions went
round in a whisper, who was the <foreign
xml:lang="fre">forestiere</foreign>—the handsome <foreign
xml:lang="fre">forestiere</foreign>—small, slight, meagre, white, with
the light hair and moustache, and that melancholy face like a woman’s?
Hamlin was quickly bored by all this magnificence; jostled to pieces,
stifled by the heat, and incense, and heavy smell of the crowd. He was
going out, when, as his eyes wandered from the silver and lights of
the altar, and the shining mitres and stoles of the priests, to that
sea of heads and bonnets and<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7107-083"/> hats in
the nave, they were suddenly and unexpectedly arrested on the side
steps of the high altar just opposite to him. There, among a lot of
heads, but high above them, was a head half covered with coarse black
lace and crisp dark hair half turned away from him; a majestic sweep
of cheek and jaw, a solemn bend of neck. A moment later the bell
tinkled for the elevation of the Host, the organ burst forth into a
rapid jig, and the church was a sea of bent heads, of kneeling and
stooping men and women. As the people suddenly sank like a wave about
the steps, there remained, stranded as it were, and rising
conspicuous, the tall and massive figure of Miss Brown. She was
standing on the altar‐steps, whose orange‐red baize cloth threw up
faint yellowish tints on to her long dress of some kind of soft white
wool, while the crimson brocade on wall and column formed a sort of
dull red background. In the mixed light of the yellow tapers and the
grey incense‐laden sunbeams, her face acquired a diaphanous pallor, as
if of a halo surrounding<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7107-084"/> it, as she
stood, her hands hanging loosely clasped, looking calmly upon the
bowed‐down crowd below. One minute, and the bell tinkling again, the
people rose with a muffled, shuffling noise, and hid her from
Hamlin. The organ and bells were pealing, the voices and violins
rising shrill, the incense curling up in grey spirals into the
sunbeams among the crimson hangings. The sonnet of Guido Cavalcanti,
about the Madonna picture, enshrined at Or San Michele behind the
blazing tapers, and in which he recognised his lady, came into
Hamlin’s mind, with the sound of the music and the fumes of the
incense; and together with it, a remembrance, a sort of picture,
hopelessly jumbled, of Laura in the church at Avignon that Good
Friday, and Beatrice among the blazing lights of the Heavenly
Rose. The Mass was over, and people began to stir and leave the
cathedral. Why had she remained standing while all the others had
knelt?  Perhaps from some Scotch puritanism; it was incongruous,
thought Hamlin. But at the same time<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7107-085"/>
he felt that, while incongruous in one way—for she ought certainly to
have knelt like the others—it had in another respect completed an
effect; this disbelieving girl had herself become, as it were, the
Madonna of the place. He stood aside and let the crowd slowly pass
out. Suddenly he saw, among the moving sea of heads, the flaxen curls
of the little Perrys—the reddish beard of Melton Perry—the head, half
covered with black lace and towering above the others, of Miss
Brown. She was leading the two smaller children, and looked anxious in
that great crowd. Up went one of the little yellow heads; she had
taken the child in her arms. All of a sudden her eyes caught those of
Hamlin standing close by, and yet separated from him by an impassable
gulf of people. Her own lit up, and with them her whole face, in a
smile, which he had never seen before. At last, near the church door,
the crowd bore his friends straight towards him.</p> <p>“What! here
after all!” cried Perry. “Up to some mischief, you cunning dog!”</p>
<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7107-086"/> <p>“Up to the mischief of watching
these good people’s devotion,” answered Hamlin.</p> <p>“Why did you
come?” asked the children eagerly.</p> <p>“I suppose because I thought
I should like to amuse myself after all,” answered Hamlin.</p> <p>They
were out on the cathedral steps, in the full glare of the blue sky.
Outside a fountain was playing, penny whistles and trumpets shrilled
on all sides, and the people at the stalls shrieked and bellowed out
their wares to the motley crowd pouring out of the church. The
children cast eyes of longing upon the booths, decorated with
tricolour flags and sprigs of green, full of gaudy dolls, and
squeaking wooden dogs, and tin trumpets, and drums; upon the tables,
covered with bottles shaped like pyramids, and china men, and
Garibaldi busts, full of red and yellow and green stuff, and with
piles of cakes with little pictures of saints stuck in the middle of
them.</p> <p>“Buy us something,” cried the little ones to their father
and Hamlin; and they squeezed<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7107-087"/> through
the crowd, and began to hesitate before the varied splendours of the
fair.</p> <p>“You look very happy, Miss Brown,” said Hamlin, as they
were waiting while the children made their choice. For really the girl
looked quite radiant,—an expression of unwonted happiness, of freedom
and amusement, shone through her quiet, almost solemn, face, like
sunshine through a thin film of mist, all the richer for being half
suppressed.</p> <p>“It is all so beautiful,” she answered, looking
round at the square surrounded by high black palaces draped with
crimson brocade, and terraces covered with green, and at the
cathedral, carved like a precious casket, beneath the blue sky.</p>
<p>“Not more beautiful than at the Villa Arnolfini, surely?”</p>
<p>She paused.</p> <p>“No, not more beautiful; but more—I don’t know
what.”</p> <p>“More cheerful?”</p> <p>She shook her head. “Yes; but
not so<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7107-088"/> much that; more free—more—I
don’t know how to call it.”</p> <p>The children were laden with
lollipops and sixpenny toys.</p> <p>“Come,” said Perry suddenly, very
cheerful, in his unaccustomed freedom from his better half, “you must
choose a fairing, Annie. What will you have?—a doll?—a beautiful
yellow ’kerchief with purple flowers, warranted the very worst colours
in creation? some gingerbread?—a penny whistle? No, I’m sure you’re
dying for some literature”—and he turned to a stone bench under a
palace, where twopenny books were piled up, and quantities of leaflets
of ballads, and lives of saints, and romantic histories, were strung
to the wall.</p> <p>“Oh!” he said, “there’s nothing for Annie here—she
hates saints and knights and poetry; we must get her a book on the
‘Rights of Man,’ or a ‘History of the French Revolution,’ at the
bookseller’s in Via Fillungo. But this is just what suits Hamlin”—and
throwing<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7107-089"/> down a heap of coppers, he
filled his hands with printed leaflets. “The tremendous adventures of
the Giant Ferracciù,” he read; “the lamentable history of Lucia of
Lamermoor; the loves of Irminda and Astolfo; the complaint of the
beautiful Fair‐haired One,—these are the things for a poet,” and he
stuffed them into Hamlin’s pockets.</p> <p>“Don’t be ridiculous,
Melton,” cried Hamlin.</p> <p>“Ridiculous!” exclaimed Perry. “Who
talks of things being ridiculous? I’m in good earnest”—and as they
went along he began declaiming, with appropriate gestures, a ballad
composed by some printer’s prentice from the libretto of an old
opera.</p> <p>The children shrieked with laughter at papa’s voice and
faces; and Anne Brown burst into a curious subdued laugh, which,
although scarcely audible, was extremely childish.</p> <p>As they
walked along the narrow crowded streets towards the inn where they
were to<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7107-090"/> have dinner, Perry kept on
ahead with the two elder children, and Hamlin hung back with Miss
Brown and the two younger.</p> <p>“Did you like the ceremony in the
cathedral, Miss Brown?” he asked, irresistibly drawn on to understand
why she had not knelt like the others.</p> <p>“It was very beautiful,”
she said; “and such beautiful vestments! Did you see the white and
gold embroidery of the bishop?—and the purple dresses of the
canons?—oh, it was lovely! But it makes me angry to see such
things.”</p> <p>“Why so?”</p> <p>“Because it is dreadful—don’t you
think?—to see all those people kneeling down and believing in all that
nonsense.”</p> <p>“How do you know it is nonsense? It seems to me very
beautiful and consoling.”</p> <p>She turned her big grey‐blue eyes
upon him. “You don’t mean that you believe in all that mummery?” she
asked, searchingly and reproachfully—“you who have studied so much;<pb
n="91" xml:id="VAB7107-091"/> you don’t believe that they can make God
come down with their mutterings and kneelings?”</p> <p>“I don’t
believe it,” answered Hamlin, with some embarrassment; “but I think it
is very beautiful, and those who do believe in it are very happy.”</p>
<p>“But you don’t think it is right that people should believe in
falsehoods, and be the slaves of wicked priests?”</p> <p>“How rabid
you are!” laughed Hamlin. “No, I don’t believe; but I like to see
others believing.”</p> <p>“I don’t;” and after a minute she added,
“Don’t you believe in anything at all?”</p> <p>“Perhaps I do,” he
said, fixing his eyes upon her. “I believe in beauty—I believe that is
the one true thing in life.”</p> <p>“I don’t know what you mean,” she
answered; “but it seems to me dreadful that people should believe in
priests and kings, and all sorts of lies.”</p> <p>They relapsed into
silence. As they walked along, Hamlin stole glances at his
companion,<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7107-092"/> walking stately and
serious like a saint or a sibyl by his side. He wondered what this
girl would have been had she lived three or four centuries back. All
this common modern radicalism distressed him in her—it had no colour
and no perfume. Yet, after all, it was but the modern accessory
instead of the medieval. This was the way in which beauty and romance
were wasted nowadays—wasted, he thought, half consciously, yet not
perhaps entirely, since it went to make up a characteristic whole.</p>
<p>Melton Perry took them to the chief inn of the place for dinner. He
let each of the children choose whatever she preferred, ordered
several bottles of <foreign xml:lang="ita">Asti spumante</foreign>,
and gave it them to drink in champagne‐glasses. The one or two furtive
English spinsters who were sipping their tea and reading their
“Murray” at the other tables of the huge dining‐room, profusely
ornamented with casts from the antique, and with cut‐paper
fiy‐floppers, looked up with surprise at the festive party headed by
Perry.<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7107-093"/> After dinner the two little
ones began to hang their heads in the hot room, and gave signs of
going to sleep.</p> <p>“Good gracious!” said Perry, in a
consternation, “what are we to do with these wretched infants? They’ll
just prevent our taking a stroll in the town before returning
home.”</p> <p>“I think the best thing will be for them to sleep a
little, sir,” suggested Anne Brown. “I will tuck them up on the sofa,
and stay with them here while you and Mr Hamlin take Miss Mildred and
Miss Winnie for a walk.”</p> <p>“But I can’t think of leaving you
behind, Annie,” cried Perry., “I know how much you would like to see
the town.”</p> <p>“I saw part of it this morning,” she swered; “and I
really would just as soon stay with the children here.” There was no
gainsaying her; so the two men sallied forth with the two elder
children on a walk through the crowded and bannered streets; while
Anne Brown remained sitting in the stuffy inn dining‐room by the side
of the torpid little<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7107-094"/> ones. When they
were out an idea suddenly struck Hamlin: this was the opportunity of
getting a present for Anne Brown. He left Perry regaling the children
on ices at a <foreign xml:lang="fre">café</foreign> opposite the
Church of St Michael, which rose like a great marble bride‐cake into
the bright blue sky, and made his way to a bookstall which he had
noticed in the morning. He asked for the ‘Vita Nuova.’ The old
bookseller looked over a number of little schedules in his desk, and
produced several copies, new and second‐hand. They did not please
Hamlin. At last he displayed a tiny Giunti volume, just delicately
yellowed by age, and bound in vellum. Hamlin bought it, and secreted
it in his pocket, and then joined Perry.</p> <p>They went to the
stable, where all the carioles from the country put up, and ordered
the waggonette to be at the inn door in an hour. But as they were
slowly mounting the wide stone staircase, with the eternal plaster
dancing nymphs tripping it on each landing, Perry’s eye fell upon a
large bill pasted upon the<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7107-095"/> opposite
wall,—the playbill of the Teatro del Giglio,—on which, among the names
of singers, fiddlers, chorus‐directors, scene‐painters, theatre
tailors, and hairdressers, streamed, in scarlet letters, the title
“Semiramide.”</p> <p>“<foreign xml:lang="ita">Tò</foreign>!” cried
Milton Perry, with the Tuscan expression for a sudden bright thought;
“what do you two young minxes say to going to hear an opera for the
first time in your lives?”</p> <p>“Oh, papa!” shrilled Mildred.</p>
<p>“Oh, papa!” echoed Winnie, catching hold of his knees—</p> <p>“Not
so quick!” exclaimed Perry; “I’m by no means so sure of it. What’s to
become of the two sleepy little worms?”</p> <p>“Send them home with
Annie,” suggested Mildred, promptly; “and you’ll take us home
later.”</p> <p>“Nothing of the kind, my young woman,” he answered
sternly. “If any one goes to the opera it shall be Annie. Make up your
mind for that.”</p> <p>The dining‐room was deserted. On a sofa<pb
n="96" xml:id="VAB7107-096"/> near the open window lay the two tiny
girls, propped up with cushions; Anne Brown, surly, flopping away the
flies which buzzed about them, and reading a newspaper. She was
resting the paper on her knees, and supporting her head with one hand,
while the other moved slowly with the cut‐paper flopper; and in this
position the young nursemaid struck Hamlin as a resuscitation, but
more beautiful and even stranger, of one of Michaelangelo’s prophetic
women.</p> <p>“I say, Annie,”’ cried Perry, “what do you say to taking
these two brats to the opera this evening?”</p> <p>Anne Brown started
up.</p> <p>“To the opera, sir?” she cried, flushing with pleasure.</p>
<p>“Yes; these creatures have never been. They’re giving ‘Semiramide’
to‐night.  I think it’s a good opera for children to begin with;
because it will teach them betimes the unhappy complications which are
apt to result from murdering one’s husband, and trying<pb n="97"
xml:id="VAB7107-097"/> to marry one’s son unawares. I’ll take the
little ones back to the villa in half an hour, and quiet Mrs Perry’s
feelings. Mr Hamlin will be delighted to accompany you and
mesdemoiselles my daughters, to the theatre, and then bring you
home. It won’t last late.”</p> <p>“But,” exclaimed Anne Brown,—“ oh,
how good of you, sir!—but are you sure you would not like to stay for
the opera yourself? I could take the little ones home.”</p> <p>“No,
thank you, Annie. The fact is, I <emph>never</emph> have approved of
Rossini’s music. Ever since my earliest infancy I have been shocked by
its want of earnestness; what I like is a symphony in P minor, with
plenty of chords of the diminished seventeenth. That’s the right sort
of thing, isn’t it, Hamlin?”</p> <p>A few minutes later Perry went
away with the two little girls, leaving Mildred and Winhie with Anne
Brown. Hamlin accompanied them down‐stairs to the waggonette.</p>
<p>“I will go to the theatre and secure a box,” he said, “and order a
trap to take us back.”</p> <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7107-098"/> <p>“All
right!” cried Perry, as the waggonette rolled off. “Mind you don’t let
those children bore you or worry poor Annie too much; and don’t leave
them alone the whole afternoon.”</p> <p>But, for some unaccountable
reason, Hamlin did leave them alone the whole afternoon. After he had
secured the box and ordered the carriage, he felt a sort of
unwillingness to go back to the inn, perhaps unconsciously, to sit
opposite the Perrys’ nursemaid; so he walked about the town till
tea‐time, not troubling himself to inquire whether Anne Brown and the
children might not prefer a stroll on the ramparts to the monotony of
sitting for two mortal hours in the inn dining‐room.</p> </div> <pb
n="99" xml:id="VAB7107-099"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER
VIII.</head> <p><hi>AT</hi> dusk they hurriedly drank some of the thin
yellow hotel‐tea; and then hastened to the theatre across the twilit
street and square, where the garlands of Venetian lanterns were
beginning to shine like jewels against the pale‐blue evening
sky. Hamlin offered Anne Brown his arm, but she asked him to give it
to Winnie Perry.</p> <p>“Mildred shall take mine,” she said—“that’s
the best way in case of a crowd.”</p> <p>A crowd, alas! there was not;
the liveried theatre servants (doubtless the same, in yellow striped
waistcoats and drab gaiters, who carried out Semiramis’s throne, when
the drop‐scene fell) made profuse bows to the little party, and handed
them at least half‐a‐dozen playbills<pb n="100"
xml:id="VAB7107-100"/>, each as large as an ordinary flag. The
children had never been in a theatre before, and were in a high state
of delight at the lights, the gilding, the red plush, the scraping of
fiddles; especially at being in a box, although the box on this
occasion cost only about half as much as would a single seat in an
English playhouse. Gradually the theatre filled; the boxes with people
of quality from surrounding villas, gentlemen displaying an ampleness
of shirt‐front, and ladies an ampleness of bosom conceivable only by
the provincial mind; the pit with townsfolk and officers: the whole
company staring with eyes and opera‐glasses, talking, singing, rapping
with sticks and sabres till the overture began to roll out, when the
audience immediately set up a kind of confused hum, supposed to be the
melody of the piece, and which half drowned the meagre orchestra.</p>
<p>Then the opera began—an opera such as only the misery and genius of
Italy could produce. There was a triumphal procession of six<pb
n="101" xml:id="VAB7107-101"/> ragamuffins in cotton trousers and with
brass kettle‐covers on their heads, marching round and round the
stage, bearing trophies of paper altar‐flowers and coffee‐biggins;
there was a row of loathsome females, bloated or fleshless, in
draggled robes too short or too long, shrieking out of tune in the
queen’s chamber—and four rapscallions in nightgowns and
Tam‐o’Shanters, and beards which would not stick on, standing round
the little spirit‐lamp burning in front of Baal’s statue; there was
the little black leathern portmanteau containing the Babylonian
regalia, which a nigger with a black‐crape face carried after the
Prince Arsaces; and there was the “magnificent apartment in the palace
of Nineveh, disclosing a delicious view of the famous hanging
gardens,” as described by the libretto, and furnished solely with a
rush‐bottomed chair and a deal table, the table‐cloth of which was so
short that Semiramis was obliged to lean her arm on it to prevent its
slipping off, which, however, it finally did. Moreover, an
incalculable<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7107-102"/> amount of singing out
of tune and pummelling one’s chest in moments of passion. No training,
no dresses, no scenery, no orchestra. Still in this miserable
performance there was an element of beauty and dignity, a something in
harmony with the grand situation and glorious music: a splendidly made
Semiramis, quite regal in her tawdry robes, who showered out volleys
of <foreign xml:lang="fre">roulades</foreign> as a bird might shower
out its trills; another young woman, plain, tall, and slight, playing
the prince in corselet and helmet, with quite magnificent attitudes of
defiance and command, with bare extended arm and supple wrist. The two
girls who played the principal parts were sisters, and although they
had certainly never sung much with a teacher, they must have sung a
great deal together; and their voices and style melted into each other
quite as if it were all a spontaneous effusion on their part. All the
realities which money can get, dress, voice, training, accessories,
scenery, utterly wanting; but instead, in the midst of pauperism,
something which money<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7107-103"/> cannot always
get, a certain ideal beauty and charm. Anne Brown was intensely
interested in the performance; indeed, quite as much so, though in
another way, as the children. During the intervals between the acts,
she could speak of nothing but the story of Semiramis, and wonder what
would happen next. Hamlin could scarcely help laughing at the concern
which she manifested each time that the hero Arsace was bullied by the
wicked Assur; but he could not laugh at the tragic way in which she
conceived the whole situation. To him all that florid music of Rossini
would already have destroyed any seriousness there might have been in
the matter; but to Anne Brown it seemed as if all these splendid
vocalisations took the place of the visible pomp and magnificence of
Assyrian royalty: for her the heroes and heroines, the magi and
satraps, were clad, not in the calico and tinsel of the theatre
tailor, but in the musical splendours of Rossini.  Hamlin, to say the
truth, found the performance very wearisome; he had been<pb n="104"
xml:id="VAB7107-104"/> bored by Semiramide too often with Tietiens and
Trebelli, to find it particularly interesting at the Teatro del Giglio
of Lucca. He sat looking on listlessly, not so much at the stage as at
the girl who was leaning out of the box before him, watching each
movement of her hand and neck, as she devoured the performance with
eyes and ears. But when at last there came the grand scene between
Semiramis and her son, whatsoever was good in the performance suddenly
burst forth; the two young women sang with a sort of spontaneous
passion, a delight in the music and their own voices and themselves;
and when, Semiramis having let down her back hair (as distressed
heroines always do) from utter despair, Prince Arsaces, not to be
outdone, pulled off his helmet, letting down his or her back hair
also, and the two sank into each other’s arms and began the great
duet, even Hamlin felt in a kind of way that this was passionate, and
tragic, and grand. Anne Brown was seated sidewise in the front of the
box, resting her mass<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7107-105"/> of iron‐black
hair on her hand, her other hand lying loosely on her knees. Her chest
heaved under her lace mantilla, and her parted lips quivered. It
seemed to Hamlin as if this were the real Semiramis, the real
mysterious king‐woman of antiquity—as if the music belonged in some
sort of ideal way to her. When the curtain had fallen amid the yells
of applause, she remained silent, letting Hamlin help her on with her
shawl without turning her eyes from the stage. The lights were rapidly
put out.</p> <p>“We must go, Miss Brown,” cried Hamlin, “otherwise we
shall be left in the dark.”</p> <p>She turned, took little Winnie by
the hand, and followed him, who led the elder Perry child, prattling
loudly, to the stairs. There was a great crowd going down, whistling
and humming tunes from the opera. From the force of habit Hamlin again
offered Anne Brown his arm. But instead of accepting it, she, so to
speak, rapidly plucked little Winnie from the ground, and raised her
in her arms as if she were a feather.</p> <pb n="106"
xml:id="VAB7107-106"/> <p>“Please let me carry that child,” cried
Hamlin.</p> <p>“Oh no,” she answered quietly. “I don’t mind carrying
her at all; but she’s too heavy for you, sir.”</p> <p>Out in the
square the carriage was awaiting them in the bright starlight, where
the red and green lamps were already dying out among the plane‐trees.
In a minute they were rattling through the narrow streets, and out of
the town by the dark tree‐masses of the bastions. The bells of the
horses jingled as they went; the melancholy shrilling of insects rose
from the fields all round; the vine‐garlands creaked in the wind. The
two children were speedily asleep—one with her head on Hamlin’s
shoulder, the other wrapped in her nurse’s shawl. Anne Brown bent over
the side of the waggonette, a dark outline, the damp night breeze
catching her hair. Neither spoke. Hamlin felt a sense of guilt
stealing over him; of guilt for nothing very definite; of guilt
towards no one else, but towards himself.<pb n="107"
xml:id="VAB7107-107"/> The drive passed like a dream. Suddenly the
wheels grated on the gravel of the villa garden; dogs barked; lights
appeared; the children were lifted out of the carriage asleep; and the
voice of Perry whispered to Hamlin—</p> <p>“I caught it nicely when I
came home—I don’t know why, upon my soul! I’m sure I wish I had
remained and amused myself with you.”</p> <p>“I wish you had,” said
Hamlin quite seriously, always with the sense of vague guilt towards
himself; then added,—</p> <p>“By the way, old man, I fear I really
must go on to Florence to‐morrow afternoon.”</p> </div> <pb n="108"

<p><hi>PERRY</hi> could not at first understand his friend’s sudden
decision, and violently combated it. But after a little while he said
to himself that it must have been fearfully dull for Hamlin at the
Villa Arnolfini, and that to have stayed so long was already much more
than a miserable being like himself could expect. So that when his
wife nearly went into hysterics at the notion of Hamlin—their
poet‐painter, as she called him—suddenly departing, he represented to
her, with more emphasis than was his wont, that Hamlin had bored
himself to death, and must be bored no longer.</p> <p>“And where are
you going?” asked the limp and Sapphic lady, as they sat at lunch.</p>
<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7107-109"/> <p>“I have no notion,” answered
Hamlin. “I know nothing beyond Florence for three days. I may go on to
Rome, Naples, Egypt, America, Japan, or return to Hammersmith. I have
no notion.”</p> <p>“Ah, these poets!” cried Mrs Perry; “they never can
tell whither their soul may waft their body.”</p> <p>When they had
finished, Hamlin asked whether he might say good‐bye to Anne Brown. “I
have a little farewell gift to make her,” he explained.</p> <p>Anne
Brown was summoned into the studio; she evidently had only just heard
the news.</p> <p>“Are you going away, sir, really?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Hamlin, drily; “I expect the gig must be waiting
for me already.”</p> <p>“And—are you not going to return, Mr
Hamlin?”</p> <p>“Oh no; I think I shall go to America this
winter.”</p> <pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7107-110"/> <p>She was silent, and
stood by the table in the attitude of a servant waiting for further
orders.</p> <p>“Before I go away,” said Hamlin, “I want to thank you,
Miss Brown, for your kindness and patience, which have enabled me to
make a sketch which will be very valuable for one of my next pictures,
and,” he added, as she merely nodded her head, “I want to beg you to
accept a little gift in remembrance of all the trouble I have given
you.”</p> <p>Anne Brown flushed, and her face suddenly changed, as if
a whip‐cord had passed across it.</p> <p>Hamlin took the little
vellum‐bound volume from his pocket.</p> <p>“You told me you had never
read the ‘Vita Nuova,’ Miss Brown,” he said, “so I venture to ask you
to accept this copy of it. I don’t know whether you like old books; I
think them much prettier to look at. Good‐bye.”</p> <p>The girl’s face
cleared into a kind of radiance.</p> <pb n="111"
xml:id="VAB7107-111"/> <p>“Thank you so much,” she said; “I will read
it often.”</p> <p>“And think of me sometimes and the trouble I gave
you?”</p> <p>“It was my duty, since Mrs Perry wished it,
sir. Good‐bye—a good journey to you.”</p> <p>“Good‐bye, Miss
Brown.”</p> </div> </div> <pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7107-112"/> <div

did not go to America. On leaving the Villa Arnolfini, he met at
Florence some artist friends, who, in his condition of utter absence
of plans, easily drew him on with them to Siena and Perugia, thence
into the smaller Umbrian cities, and finally into a wholly unexplored
region between the Abruzzo and the Adriatic. By the time that their
sketching and article‐writing expedition was at an end, the winter had
come round, and more than three months had elapsed since Hamlin had
parted with the Perrys.  Would Hamlin return with his friends to
England? He had often said that he had had enough of Italy—that he
would go home and shut himself<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7107-114"/> up in
his studio at Hammersmith, among smoke and river‐fogs, seeing not a
living creature, learning Persian and studying Sufi poets until next
spring, when he would set off for the East, never more to return to
Europe, except for the Grosvenor private view. But when the moment for
return north approached, Hamlin began to hesitate; and the very day
before his friends’ departure, he informed them that he had come to
the conclusion that there was still some work for him to do in
Italy.</p> <p>“I shall be in England at the end of two months at
latest,” he said.</p> <p>And on their remonstrating at his fickleness,
he merely answered—</p> <p>“I have a notion for a new picture, and I
think I have found my model for it.”</p> <p>“‘The Queen of Night’ in
your portfolio,” suggested one of his friends.</p> <p>They had noticed
and generally admired that strange head, the like of which none of
them had ever seen before, and they had given the drawing, which
Hamlin described<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7107-115"/> merely as “a girl
near Lucca,” the nickname of “The Queen of Night.”</p> <p>“Yes,”
answered Hamlin, “that’s the one I’m thinking about.”</p> <p>So the
rest of the party set sail from Civita Vecchia; and one drizzly, foggy
morning, Hamlin got into the train to carry him northward to
Florence.</p> <p>During those three months, he could scarcely himself
have explained when or how, strange notions had come into Hamlin’s
head, and a still stranger plan had finally matured in it. He had been
haunted by the remembrance of the Perrys’ nursemaid at the Villa
Arnolfini, and gradually taken to brooding and day‐dreaming about
her. He had made up his mind that Anne Brown was the most beautiful
girl, in the strangest style, whom he had ever met. What was to be her
future? Of two possibilities one must be realised. Either this
magnificent blossom was to be untimely nipped,—this beautiful and
strange girl was to fritter away her life, unnoticed, wasted, to<pb
n="118" xml:id="VAB7107-116"/> little by little lose her beauty, her
dignity, her grandeur, her whole imaginative aroma; or the rare plant
of beauty was to be cherished, nursed into perfection, till it burst
out in maturity of splendour, a thing of delight for the present and
of wonder for the future.  Either Anne Brown must turn into a sordid
nursery‐governess, or into the avowedly most beautiful woman in
England—that is to say, in the particular pre‐Raphaelite society which
constituted England to him.</p> <p>Yet not necessarily; there was
still a middle course—she might marry some small shopkeeper or teacher
of languages at Florence; or, perhaps, some artist might notice her,
make her his mistress, perhaps his wife. This last thought of Anne
Brown as the possible wife of some other Melton Perry (for they were
all Melton Perrys at Florence) filled Hamlin with a vague disgust and
irritation. Much better that she should end her life as a
nursery‐maid, or a daily governess at a franc the hour. Still, it was
dreadful to think that something so<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7107-117"/>
unique should be lost, wasted for ever. “Such things must be,” said
Hamlin to himself; “it is sad, but it can’t be helped.” And he wrote
two sonnets, “Lost Loveliness,” and “Stillborn Joy,” which were
extremely beautiful, and quite among the finest he ever wrote. But
this did not despatch the subject. The sense of having made the most
of the fact that this loveliness was to be wasted, this joy of beauty
to be stillborn, did not make up for the consciousness that the waste,
the abortion, had not actually taken place, might yet be prevented,
and were dreadful in themselves. Was he, Hamlin, to marry Anne Brown?
He shrank in terror from so Quixotic, and at the same time so
commonplace, so school‐girlish a thought. But if he did not marry her
no other man could; at least, no other man who was to prevent the act
of wastefulness to be consummated. She might marry a clerk, a
shopkeeper, even a servant, or even some miserable little
Anglo‐Florentine artist; but if she married a man above that, a man to
appreciate and<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7107-118"/> make the most of her,
that man must evidently be himself. It is difficult to follow the
logic of this notion; but certain it is that Hamlin never doubted for
a second that either Anne Brown must bloom for him and by him, must be
his most precious possession and his most precious loan to the
world—or that Anne Brown must be simply and deliberately buried under
a bushel. Such arguments are matters of character, I suppose; be it as
it may, the argument was absolutely cogent.</p> <p>When Hamlin had got
thus far he stopped for a long time, revolving the matter in his mind
in a purely abstract way, without attempting to realise how things
might be settled. He was not a man of action or of resolves, and would
usually let things slip on and look at them slipping; and during this
ruminating condition, he did not once seriously ask himself whether he
intended marrying the Perrys’ nursemaid. But suddenly, the very day
before his friends were to carry him back to England, a new notion
came into his head. His life seemed<pb n="121" xml:id="VAB7107-119"/>
suddenly filled with romance. The matter was settled in a minute. Anne
Brown was to be filched triumphantly from oblivion: he telegraphed
Perry to hire him rooms in Florence. As the meeting of certain
chemical substances will sometimes produce a new and undreamt‐of
something of wholly unprecedented properties, so ideas had come in
collision in Hamlin’s mind, and out of a mere perplexity had arisen a
stranger scheme—out of the question what should be the fate of Anne
Brown, had originated the decision what was to be the future of Walter
Hamlin. The situations seemed changed: instead of his being a mere
possible, but by no means probable, instrument of a change in her
life, she was the predestined instrument for the consummation of his
life.  Anne Brown should live for the world and for fame; and Walter
Hamlin’s life should be crowned by gradually endowing with vitality,
and then wooing, awakening the love of this beautiful Galatea whose
soul he had moulded, even as Pygmalion had moulded the limbs of<pb
n="122" xml:id="VAB7107-120"/> the image which he had made to live and
to love. The idea, once present to Hamlin’s mind, had been accepted at
once; and in another hour he had worked out all the details of the
real romance in which he was embarking; he had determined exactly
where he would send Anne Brown to school, where he would go during her
stay there, what settlements he would make to ensure her complete
freedom of choice when she should choose him, in what part of London
he would buy a house for her, which of his female relations should
have charge of her, by whom she should be introduced into artistic
society;—he began to imagine all the details of his long
courtship. Beyond the courtship, into their actual married life, his
fancy did not carry him; it was that year, or two or three years of
gradually growing devotion, upon which he cared to dwell. Whether such
a scheme was wise or right it never occurred to him to question. He
had determined on educating, wooing, and marrying a woman like what
Anne Brown seemed to be,<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7107-121"/> as a man
might determine to buy a house in a particular fishing or hunting
district—the only thing is to make sure whether the particular house
is the suitable house. The only further concern of Hamlin was to make
sure that Anne Brown was really all that she seemed to him to be; and
Hamlin looked forward as to a kind of preliminary romance to the
strange inspection, this minute examination of a creature who should
never guess the extraordinary metamorphosis which might, or might not,
be in store for her.</p> </div> <pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7107-122"/>
<div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER II.</head> <p><hi>A WEEK</hi> later
Hamlin was painting Anne Brown in a studio which he had hired for
three months. She had manifested some pleasure when, unexpectedly, Mrs
Perry had told her of his return, and of his desire to have her once
more for a model; but the manifestation thereof was so calm, or rather
so mingled with her usual haughty indifference, that her romantic and
passionate mistress had forthwith made up her mind that Anne Brown was
a mere soulless body, and communicated that fact to her husband.</p>
<p>“I don’t see why Annie should be particularly delighted at the
prospect of sitting for two hours, twice a‐week, with her head raised
and her throat outstretched, in a beastly cold<pb n="125"
xml:id="VAB7107-123"/> studio,” answered Perry, affecting, as he
frequently did, from a curious kind of coyness, not to understand his
wife’s underlying meaning.</p> <p>“She is a mere soulless body,”
repeated Mrs Perry—“as indifferent to Hamlin as a handsome cow would
be.”</p> <p>“Do you expect her to throw herself into Hamlin’s arms?”
cried Perry, angrily.</p> <p>“I expect her,” answered Mrs Perry, with
a kind of haughty mystery and sadness, “to be a woman.”</p> <p>“And I
expect you to attend to her remaining what she is—an honest girl,”
retorted Perry.</p> <p>“Melton!” said his wife solemnly; and
immediately poor Perry’s principles drooped like a furled sail.</p>
<p>Melton Perry had always an uncomfortable feeling of responsibility
regarding Anne Brown; a sort of sense that, as poor old Miss Curzon
had been grievously mistaken in intrusting a girl like Anne Brown to a
lady so mystical<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7107-124"/> and romantic as his
wife, he, on his part, hardened sinner, social wreck as he doubtless
was, was in duty bound to make up for the good old woman’s want of
discernment. If it had been any one except Hamlin, he repeated to
himself, he would never have permitted a single sitting; but Hamlin
was a Sir Galahad—at least with regard to servant girls and
suchlike—who had always struck Perry dumb with wonder; and in this
instance in particular, Hamlin seemed really to consider Anne Brown
much in the light of a picture by an old master. Yet even thus, it had
taken him by surprise, and relieved his mind of a heavy weight, when,
the day before the first sitting in the studio, Ham]in had asked Mrs
Perry to tell him of some elderly woman—some former housekeeper or
nurse in an English family—who could come to his studio and keep it in
order two or three times a‐week.</p> <p>“I can recommend you a most
delightful young laundress,” exclaimed Mrs Perry with fervour—“quite a
Palma Vecchio.”</p> <pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7107-125"/> <p>“Thank you,”
answered Hamlin, drily; “I particularly want an elderly woman who can
take charge of my things, and who can be there when—I mean, who can
take Miss Brown’s bonnet and shawl when she comes to sit to me.”</p>
<p>Mrs Perry confessed to no knowledge of such a person, but sat down
to write to the German deaconesses,—“such real saints,”—in quest of
the desired piece of elderly respectability. But when she had gone to
her writing‐table, Melton Perry kicked Hamlin’s foot under the table,
and said in an undertone—</p> <p>“You are a damned moral dog,
certainly, Wat. Thank you so much, old fellow.”</p> <p>So the old
housekeeper was hired to go three times a‐week to Hamlin’s studio, and
twice a‐week she opened the studio door to Anne Brown, and took the
girl’s poke‐bonnet and grey shawl in the little anteroom, crammed full
of dwarf orange‐trees, which opened into the pillared balcony circling
round the topmost floor of the old palace, and from which<pb n="128"
xml:id="VAB7107-126"/> you looked into the lichened court, and saw the
steel‐like sheen of the water in the well. Hamlin had determined to
embody one of his usual mystical fancies in his new picture. His
pictures came to him first as poems, and he had written a sonnet
descriptive of his intended work before he had painted a stroke of
it. It was called Venus Victrix; and the strangeness, the
mysteriousness which gave a charm to his beautiful church‐window‐like
pictures, and made one forget for a minute the uncertainty of drawing
and the weakness of flesh‐painting—this essential quality of the
pictorial riddle depended very much upon the fact that his Venus
Victrix was entirely unlike any other Venus Victrix which the mind of
man could conceive. Instead of the naked goddess triumphing over the
apple of Paris, whom such a name would lead you to expect, Hamlin made
a sketch of a lady in a dress of sad‐coloured green and gold brocade,
seated in a melancholy landscape of distant barren peaks, suffused
with the grey and yellow tints<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7107-127"/> of a
late sunset; behind her was a bower of sear‐coloured palms, knotting
their boughs into a kind of canopy for her head, and in her hand she
held, dragged despondingly on the ground, a broken palm‐branch. The
expression of the goddess of Love, since such she was, was one of
intense melancholy. It was one of those pictures which go to the head
with a perfectly unintelligible mystery, and which absolutely preclude
all possibility of inquiring into their exact meaning. A picture which
might have been one of Hamlin’s best, only that it was never
finished.</p> <p>For, it must be remembered, the picture, or rather
the painting of it, was merely an excuse invented by Hamlin for an
opportunity of seeing, of examining, the creature whose future was in
his hands. He wished to assure himself that Anne Brown was really the
Anne Brown of his fancy; and as he stared at that strange and
beautiful face, it was not in reality with the object of transferring
it on to his canvas, but to make sure whether it was<pb n="130"
xml:id="VAB7107-128"/> really as strange as it seemed to him. It was
also to gauge whatever mystery there might be hidden in that singular
nature. Whether he ever did gauge it, it is impossible to tell.  There
was, he felt, something strange there—something which corresponded
with the magnificent and mysterious outside,—a possibility of thought
and emotion enclosed like the bud in its case of young leaves—a
potential passion, good or bad, of some sort. At Anne Brown’s actual
character it was difficult to get; or rather, perhaps, there was as
yet but little actual character to get at. He became more and more
persuaded, as he sat opposite to her, painting and talking—or,
interrupting the sitting, playing to her strange songs which he had
picked up in his travels, and fragments of forgotten operas which it
was his mania to collect—that Anne Brown was in reality much younger
than her years; that beneath those solemn features there was a still
immature soul wrapped up in mere conventional ideas of right and
wrong,<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7107-129"/> a few inherited republican
formulæ, and a natural pride which had grown, as does any protecting
skin, physical or moral, where surroundings are for ever chafing and
wearing. A soul, above all, which had never yet sought for an
ideal—had never loved; and this knowledge was to Hamlin a source of
infinite satisfaction.</p> <p>It was a satisfaction, also, to notice
how, little by little, whatever ideals seemed to bud in Anne Brown’s
mind, were connected with him, or at least with the things which he
presented to her imagination. Nay, with himself, as a person not at
all, but yet with the books, the music, the pictures about which he
talked to her. This studio, so unlike the bleak and tobacco‐reeking
workshop of Melton Perry, with its curious carved furniture, its
Japanese screens, its bits of brocade and tapestry (rubbish which
Hamlin would have blushed at in London), its shelves of books and
chipped majolica and glass, its quantity of flowers, was evidently a
sort of earthly paradise to the<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7107-130"/>
girl. And the handsome, pale, serious young man, with womanishly
regular feature and world‐worn look, who treated her with a sort of
protecting deference, who instructed her in what she ought to like and
dislike, and at the same time asked with real earnestness for her
opinion, was evidently its affable archangel. This Hamlin perceived to
his pleasure; but, nevertheless, he perceived also that all feeling,
all ideas, were in Anne Brown vague, immature, or merely
potential—unless, indeed, this tragic‐looking creature repressed and
drowned in the darkness of her consciousness anything more definite
and developed.</p> <p>They did not talk very much, for they were both
of them rather taciturn; but what they said acquired therefrom more
than doubled importance. And of this talking Hamlin did by far the
greater share. Anne Brown had indeed little to say—a nursery‐maid of
nineteen has not much to tell a fashionable poet‐painter of
thirty‐one: slight descriptions of places she had been to, villas, or
bathing‐places, and one or two<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7107-131"/>
excursions from them; vague reminiscences of old Miss Curzon, of the
books which she had made the girl read, the music she had heard, the
anecdotes of Landor and Rossini and Malibran which the old lady had
narrated; a few allusions, short and passionate, to her father; a few
more, sullen and dreary, to her own future life;—that was all that
poor Anne Brown could say.</p> <p>For when he told her the plots of
novels, and repeated scraps of poems to her, she scarcely ventured to
give him her opinion. She was so earnest that she felt that only
something worth saying should be said; and what things worth saying
could she say to him?</p> <p>“By the way,” said Hamlin one day, as she
stood, tying her bonnet, and looking out over the sea of shingly
roofs, the sudden gaps showing shady gardens far below, open <foreign
xml:lang="ita">loggias</foreign>, between whose columns fluttered
linen, and irregular rows of windows with herbs in broken ewers on
their sills—“by the way, you have never<pb n="134"
xml:id="VAB7107-132"/> told me how you liked the ‘Vita Nuova,’ Miss
Brown.” He had talked of so many books, making her wonder and
sometimes laugh at his account of them, but never about that, nor
about his own.</p> <p>“It is very beautiful,” she said, still looking
out of the window—“but do you think it is true?”</p> <p>“Why not?” he
said.</p> <p>“I don’t know—I don’t think there are men like that;”
then she suddenly added, with a sort of melancholy humorous laugh,
which was frequent with her, “I will make my pupils read it when I am
a <foreign xml:lang="ita">parlatrice</foreign>. Those ladies will tell
me their opinion.”</p> <p>Hamlin was looking at her, as she still
turned her massive head, with its waves of iron‐black hair, away from
him, towards the light.</p> <p>“Good‐bye,” she said, with her hand on
the door‐latch.</p> <p>“Stop a minute,” said Hamlin; and going<pb
n="135" xml:id="VAB7107-133"/> to a book‐shelf, he got down a little
green‐bound volume.</p> <p>“I don’t know why,” he said, “but I should
like you to read these. It is idiotic trash after the ‘Vita Nuova’—but
it is mine.”</p> <p>“Thank you,” she said. “I will bring it you back
next sitting. I will cover the binding.”</p> <p>“I want you to keep
it. Won’t you do me that favour?”</p> <p>She reddened all over her
pale face.</p> <p>“Thank you,” she said. “’It is very good of
you.”</p> </div> <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7107-134"/> <div
type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER III.</head> <p><hi>IT</hi> so happened
that as Anne Brown was walking quickly home she was overtaken by
Melton Perry.</p> <p>“What’s that book, Annie?” he inquired, as they
walked side by side.</p> <p>“Mr Hamlin gave it me—it’s his poems.”</p>
<p>“Let me see.” Perry was more peremptory than usual.</p> <p>He
turned over the leaves as they went along, and then returned it to
her.</p> <p>“You may read that,” he said—“it’s sad trash, but you may
read it. All poetry isn’t fit for women to read,” he added, by way of
explanation.</p> <p>The gift of this book somehow disturbed Perry’s
equanimity.</p> <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7107-135"/> <p>“What made him
give you that book?” he asked.</p> <p>“I don’t know, sir. We were
talking about the ‘Vita Nuova.’”</p> <p>“A lot of confounded medieval
twaddle,” cried Perry. “Why don’t you read ‘Lady Audley’s Secret’ or
‘The Heir of Redclyffe’? that’s the right sort of thing.”</p> <p>She
seemed hurt, and they were silent. Suddenly Perry said, with some
roughness—</p> <p>“I’m sorry to inconvenience Hamlin, but this will be
the last of the sittings. I am going to send you to the sea‐side with
the children in a day or two. Little May needs change of air. When you
return, Mr Hamlin will be leaving Florence.”</p> <p>“Yes, sir,”
answered Anne Brown; and a kind of suppressed spasm passed across her
face.</p> <p>Perry saw it.</p> <p>“It’s high time,” he said to
himself.</p> <p>Melton Perry could not screw up his courage<pb n="138"
xml:id="VAB7107-136"/> till he and his wife and Hamlin had already
finished dinner that evening.</p> <p>“I say, Hamlin,” he began,
lighting his pipe, while Mrs Perry artistically twisted a cigarette in
her long brown fingers—“d’you think you could finish off that picture
with only one more sitting? I’m sure Mrs Perry thinks it is time for
the children to go down to the sea‐side—only, of course, she doesn’t
like disturbing you in your work.”</p> <p>“Go down to the sea‐side!”
exclaimed Mrs Perry, not at all mollified by her husband’s deference;
“who talks of going to the seaside? and what has that to do with his
work?”</p> <p>“You forget, my dear, that you said this morning that
May requires change of air—and, of course, Annie will be required to
take the children down to Viareggio. I am extremely sorry for you, old
fellow, but I fear you must finish that picture—at least so far as
Annie is concerned—by the beginning of next week.”</p> <p>“I see,”
answered Hamlin, briefly. For the first time in his life almost, he
felt angry with<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7107-137"/> his old friend; an
unspeakable resentment at this interference with what he considered
already as his.</p> <p>“<emph>I</emph> see nothing of the sort,” burst
out Mrs Perry; “I will never, never permit dear Hamlin’s masterpiece
to be spoilt. I would rather take the children to the sea‐side
myself—oh yes. I would rather they did not go at all. My children are
the dearest things I possess, but I have no right selfishly to prefer
their welfare to the completion of such a picture. I should never
forgive myself. That unfinished picture, that strange, terrible Venus,
would haunt me in my dreams, and I should hear the whole world asking
me, ‘What have you done with a thing meant for our joy?’”</p>
<p>“Bosh!” cried Perry, stretching out his legs and puffing at his
pipe—“rubbish! A fine thing if May gets low fever again: much you’ll
think of Hamlin’s masterpiece then.”</p> <p>“May shall not have
fever,” answered Mrs Perry, haughtily; “and Hamlin’s masterpiece,
which you choose to sneer at—”</p> <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7107-138"/>
<p>“Oh, please, don’t bother about my masterpieces!” interposed
Hamlin.</p> <p>“—Shall not be sacrificed. You shall take the children
to the sea‐side, Melton; and Annie shall continue to give him as many
sittings as he may wish.” And then, passing over her husband’s
nauseous existence, she began a mellifluous and irrelevant
conversation with Hamlin across him.</p> <p>But after two or three
minutes Perry could stand it no longer.</p> <p>“Damn your sea‐side!”
he suddenly burst out.</p> <p>“Melton!” shrieked Mrs Perry, falling
back on her chair.</p> <p>“Damn your sea‐side!” repeated
Perry. “Haven’t you eyes in your head to understand that the sea‐side
has nothing to do with the matter? The children no more require to go
to Viareggio than I require to be made Khan of Tartary. What is
required is that an honest girl, who was intrusted to us by an old
friend, should not get to be talked of as a—”</p> <pb n="141"
xml:id="VAB7107-139"/> <p>“This loathsome coarseness is too much for
me. Adieu, Mr Hamlin!” and Mrs Perry flounced out of the room.</p>
<p>“Lord deliver us from womankind!” exclaimed Perry, as the door shut
upon his wife, and he fell back in his chair. “What a nice breakfast I
shall have to‐morrow!”</p> <p>Hamlin did not answer, but merely lit
another cigarette, and looked into the smouldering fire.</p>
<p>“Hamlin, old boy,” resumed Perry, “don’t be down upon me. I really
am confoundedly sorry to bother you—indeed I am; but—you see—about
this girl—”</p> <p>“I understand,” answered Hamlin, shortly; “don’t
let’s talk about it.”</p> <p>“But—please don’t be in a rage with me,
Watty,” cried Perry, appealingly; “really I don’t know what to do. You
see, it’s not as if she were an ordinary girl or an ordinary servant;
then I should say—hang it, please yourself!”</p> <p>“Sweet morals!”
sneered Hamlin.</p> <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7107-140"/> <p>“But with
her it’s different; I’m sure you must recognise that yourself. Now I
don’t mean to say you are in the least to blame, or that the girl
cares the least scrap about you; but still, this sort of thing won’t
do. I know you’re the last man to do a dirty thing—indeed you’re the
only man whom I would have permitted to go on so long. But then, quite
without meaning anything, all that sitting, and talking, and
discussing poetry and ‘Vita Nuova’ together—without knowing it, it
puts ideas into a girl’s head, makes her dissatisfied, that sort of
thing, and the result is that she goes to the bad. And then, here in
Florence especially, a girl’s none the better looked at for having
sat, if even only to one man. People begin to talk (at the villa it
was another matter), stories go round, and it becomes difficult for
her to get a respectable situation.”</p> <p>“You needn’t say any
more,” cried Hamlin, with almost feminine impatience.  All this gave
him a sense of moral nausea.</p> <p>“You understand, old fellow, I
don’t mean<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7107-141"/> it about you in
particular,” persisted Perry; “indeed you’ve behaved like Sir Bors,
Sir Percival, and Sir Galahad all rolled into one. But it’s the
fatality of the circumstances, the beastly world about us. You’re not
angry, are you, with me?”</p> <p>“Not a bit,” answered Hamlin,
quietly, minutely examining one of the pictures on the wall, which was
not worth looking at, and had been thoroughly looked at by him
already; “not a bit, my dear Perry. I suppose you have no objection to
Miss Brown giving me one more morning?”</p> <p>“Not the least—two, or
even three, for the matter of that. I was only anxious not to spin out
things indefinitely.”</p> <p>“One more sitting will be more than
enough,” answered Hamlin. “By the way, before I go, I want to do a
drawing of little Mildred.”</p> </div> <pb n="144"

<p><hi>IT</hi> was a cold and drizzling February morning that last
sitting which Anne Brown was to give to Walter Hamlin. As the girl
slowly mounted the well‐like stairs of the old tower palace, and saw
the distant snow‐covered hills through the dim windows on the
landings, she thought with sadness that this was the last time she
should toil up to Hamlin’s studio. A lethargy weighed upon her, making
her feel that everything was dreary and unreal, such as she had
experienced only once or twice before, when one of the few holidays of
her childhood had drawn to a close. The cheerless, colourless,
eventless, joyless routine of ordinary life was about to close over,
to engulf, her little island of brightness. She was longer<pb n="145"
xml:id="VAB7107-143"/> than usual taking off her bonnet and cloak in
the anteroom filled with orange‐trees, for she felt as if she must
look at everything well one last time—at the bits of brocade and the
photographs on the wall, the plaster‐casts on the shelf, the scarlet
and purple anemones in the cracked china bow], the brass synagogue
lamp hanging in the window.</p> <p>“It is bad weather,” said Hamlin’s
old housekeeper.</p> <p>“Horrible,” answered Anne, looking vacantly
through the window at the grey sky and wet roofs.</p> <p>The old woman
opened the studio door and drew the curtains. Hamlin, who was at a
table writing, rose and came to meet his model.</p> <p>“It is very
good of you to come in such horrible weather, Miss Brown,” he
said.</p> <p>“It is the last sitting—I thought I ought not to miss
it,” and she sat down at once in the arm‐chair of faded green velvet
opposite Hamlin’s easel.</p> <pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7107-144"/>
<p>“Won’t you warm yourself a little?” he asked.</p> <p>“No, thank
you; I am not cold.”</p> <p>Hamlin began to prepare his paints.</p>
<p>“You are going to Viareggio, Miss Brown,” he remarked.</p> <p>“Yes;
I believe I am.”</p> <p>“You will enjoy the change of air. The sea—you
told me you liked the sea one day,”—and he went on squeezing the
paints on to his palette.</p> <p>“I suppose so.” She said no more.</p>
<p>Hamlin was seated before his easel, looking now at his work and now
at her, and making minute alterations with a small brush. They did not
talk much. He seemed bent upon his work. He had told her that she need
not keep her head in position, as he was merely finishing some
unimportant details. Her eyes wandered round the room—at the books,
the sketches on the wall, the rugs under foot. On the chimney‐piece
was stuck a photograph of Melton Perry. If only she might have a
photograph<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7107-145"/> of Hamlin! . . . For less
than a second she thought she might beg for one; then it seemed to her
impossible, and the wish beat itself painfully against that cold, dead
impossibility, like a bird against its cage‐bars.</p> <p>Hamlin called
the old woman—</p> <p>“Take that letter to the post‐office at the
Uffizi,” he said, pointing to his writing‐table, “and mind you get it
registered.”</p> <p>It was the first time that Hamlin had sent the old
woman on an errand during one of Anne Brown’s sittings, when she was
wont to go in and out of the studio noiselessly, like a watchful
duenna.</p> <p>The heavy stairs door banged behind her. Anne listened
to it dully, vacantly, as one listens to things when deeply
preoccupied. For a few minutes Hamlin worked on in silence, then
suddenly, without looking up, he said—</p> <p>“Do you remember my
finding your ‘Dante’ in the vineyard at the Villa Arnolfini, Miss
Brown?”</p> <p>“Yes,” she answered.</p> <pb n="148"
xml:id="VAB7107-146"/> <p>“And you told me that you wished to fit
yourself to be a teacher?”</p> <p>“Yes, I remember.”</p> <p>“Well,”
went on Hamlin, “I have been thinking about that; and I think it would
be a pity—I mean—I hope you won’t think it horribly rude of me to say
so—I think it would be better if you went to school for a little while
yourself.”</p> <p>Anne stared at this speech, and at the close of it
her surprise turned to resentment.</p> <p>“Of course it would be
better,” she said, bitterly; “of course I shall always be very
ignorant; but I have no wish to set up for what I am not. I am not
going to teach people anything—only to correct their pronunciation and
a few mistakes. One does not require to study much for that, and I
shall be competent to do it.”</p> <p>In her quiet, subdued way she
looked very angry.</p> <p>Hamlin rose from his easel.</p> <p>“You
misunderstand me,” he said; “and<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7107-147"/>
indeed what I have to say is so strange and perhaps so unjustifiable,
that you have every right to do so. Listen,” and he drew a chair near
hers.</p> <p>“Please do not think me very bold, and forgive the horrid
way in which I am forced to put things, when I tell you, dear Miss
Brown, that I am very much interested in you, and, indeed—will you
forgive a comparative stranger saying so?—that I have never felt so
much attracted by any one as I do by you.”</p> <p>Anne Brown did not
answer; she seemed literally petrified by sheer astonishment.</p>
<p>“The time has come when our acquaintance must come to an end,” went
on Hamlin, rapidly; “but I cannot let this happen without making an
effort to prolong it. I have no brothers or sisters—no one, at least,
living with me, except distant relations. I have never taken much
interest in anybody. But now I want to know—would you, instead of our
parting company altogether—would you let me become<pb n="150"
xml:id="VAB7107-148"/> your guardian for the next few years, and as
such, would you let me take charge of your education and send you to
school? It seems a very ridiculous thing to suggest. But still you
must not be angry with me for doing so.”</p> <p>Anne’s big onyx eyes
had opened wider and wider. She flushed purple in the middle of his
speech, then turned ashy‐white, while she picked convulsively at the
fringe of the armchair. Then suddenly a sort of convulsion came across
her face, and, as if from sheer unbearable tension of feeling, she
burst into tears.</p> <p>She gave way only one second, immediately
trying to stop herself, but in vain. Hamlin felt that he was making a
horrible mess of it. He came close up to the chair where the poor girl
was thrown back, shaken with sobs.</p> <p>“Miss Brown,” he cried,
taking her hand—“Anne—oh, don’t be unhappy! I did not mean to offend
you. Don’t you understand my meaning? I wish you to be what you have a
right to be. I wish you to be in<pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7107-149"/>
such a position that of all the men in the world you may choose the
one who deserves you most. Anne, I love you—and I hope that perhaps
some day you may love me; but I want you to be able to love whoever
may best deserve you, and merely to do my best that you should care
for me. I want you to have a future independent of me—to possess the
education and the fortune which shall enable you to marry whomsoever
you will, or not to marry at all. Will you let me, for the time being,
be your guardian, your father, your brother; let me provide for you,
take care of your money, see to your education? I do not ask you to
love me, but merely to give me a chance of trying to make you prefer
me.”</p> <p>Anne did not cease sobbing; and every convulsive heaving
of her body made Hamlin feel a sort of sickening terror. He slid down
on his knees and kissed her hand.</p> <p>This action seemed suddenly
to awaken her. She started up, and making a tremendous effort, stopped
her crying.</p> <pb n="152" xml:id="VAB7107-150"/> <p>He stood aside
while she went to the mirror and looked at her swollen eyes and
convulsed face.</p> <p>“May I have a glass of water?” she asked; then,
stopping Hamlin, “never mind,” she said—“never mind—I must go;” and
she pulled her blue veil hurriedly over her eyes and huddled on her
cloak.</p> <p>“Miss Brown,” cried Hamlin, “why don’t you answer me?”
and he laid hold of her arm as she was about to open the door.</p>
<p>“Because you do not deserve it,” she answered, trying to loosen his
grasp.  “Let me go, please.”</p> <p>“I cannot let you go,” answered
Hamlin calmly, standing before the door, “until you have listened to
me. Will you let me provide for your future, send you to school, and
then place you in the care of my aunt? Will you let me act as if I
were your guardian for the next three years, and at the end of them
you shall have enough to live and marry as befits a lady, and be as
free as air, or become my<pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7107-151"/>
wife—whichever you shall choose? Answer me, for I am serious.”</p>
<p>Anne Brown paused.</p> <p>“Don’t ask me for an answer now,” she
said; “I am not sure that you are in earnest.”</p> <p>“I am—indeed I
am!” cried Hamlin; “I have intended asking you this ever since my
return to Florence. I returned merely in order to ask you. I am in
earnest; cannot you give me a serious answer?”</p> <p>“Not now—I can’t
think about anything; I must ask; I don’t know what is right to
do.”</p> <p>He opened the door, and Anne Brown walked out rapidly,
through the anteroom and downstairs.</p> </div> <pb n="154"
xml:id="VAB7107-152"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
<p><hi>FOR</hi> a long time Anne Brown remained as it were dazed, as
if she had received a blow on the head. When she got back to the
Perrys’ house, she felt broken in all her limbs, and slipped up‐stairs
and threw herself on her bed. But it was no use: all that day, while
attending on the children and doing her usual work, she felt as if
some one else were doing it all; while she remained conscious only of
something very sudden and strange, of a confused buzzing in her brain,
through which she heard the voice of Hamlin repeating his words in the
studio; words which somehow made her indignant, angry, and at the same
time filled her with a sense of having done something which she should
not. This feeling increased<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7107-153"/> at
night, and she lay awake while the clocks struck hour after hour, hot,
red, half deafened by her own blood, fevered and vaguely indignant. It
was as if Hamlin had struck her; she felt insulted, outraged, by this
strange interference with her fate, this wonderful intrusion of
excitement into her dull and sombre life. It was dawn when she awoke:
a chill greyness in the sky, reddened by the pale winter sun. She knew
that something had happened, that something was changed. She was
almost surprised to find herself in her usual room, with the
children’s tea‐sets on the chest of drawers, the coloured pictures
from the ‘Illustrated’ and the ‘Graphic’ pinned on the walls, the
dolls’ houses in the corner, and little May asleep by her side in her
crib. Then she remembered it all, and sat up in her bed thinking about
it. Things appeared to her in quite a new light. She had been an
ungrateful beast to feel as she had towards Hamlin; and a great wave
of gratitude and awe, and love and joy, welled up in her heart. It was
as if she were sitting<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7107-154"/> in the
sunshine: an indefinable kind of happiness. How noble and generous and
good he had been; and how doubly so, being so great, and she being a
mere nothing in the world! Whether he loved her or she him, she did
not ask herself; it seemed a thing to die of for sheer happiness, that
any one should care for her and her future. And just in proportion to
her usual pride, and sullenness, and joylessness, she felt happy in
the idea of deserving nothing and receiving everything, from his
kindness: and Hamlin, with whom she had spoken not twenty‐four hours
earlier, whom she would see again that day, appeared to her as a
distant, dim, ineffable creature, lighting and warming her like the
sun, but equally unapproachable. But on thinking it over, things came
round to commonplace actuality. What was she to do? Would he ask her
again? or even, had he asked her at all? It all seemed a dream, and
she did not venture to examine into its reality. She determined to
tell it all to Perry, and ask his advice; but she felt as<pb n="157"
xml:id="VAB7107-155"/> if she never could. She met Perry several times
in the course of the morning, but she could not succeed in screwing up
her courage. What if it should all prove to be an illusion? She took
the children out for their accustomed walk, during which she was even
more silent than usual. On returning home she saw Hamlin in the
street, close to the door. The blood all rushed up to her head. Hamlin
saluted her as if nothing had happened, and accompanied her
up‐stairs. When they were at the landing he suddenly turned to
her—</p> <p>“Have you thought over our conversation in the studio
yesterday, Miss Brown?”  he asked.</p> <p>“Yes,” answered Anne,
inaudibly, as he stood with his hand on the bell; “I have.”</p>
<p>“Well, then,” went on Hamlin, “with regard to the plan which I
submitted to you, what is your answer? Do you consent or not?”</p>
<p>Anne Brown raised her head.</p> <p>“I consent,” she answered
quietly, looking<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7107-156"/> full at him, as if
to make sure that she was not talking in a dream. He had never seen
her so beautiful and majestic before; and she had a look—with dilated
eyes, and rapid, oppressed breath—like the one which he had noticed
once when she talked of her father, and of which he had felt at once,
“this is what I want.”</p> <p>“Thank you,” he answered gravely, and
rang the bell. For a moment they stood in silence, till the door was
opened.</p> </div> <pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7107-157"/> <div
type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER VI.</head> <p><hi>HAMLIN</hi> sat for
some time in the dusty attic called a studio, while Perry cut acrobats
and devils out of black paper, and stuck them on the dirty
window‐panes.</p> <p>“That’s my vocation,” said Perry, “and not
painting damned landscape spinach and soapsud seas. Look! aren’t they
jolly old fiends?” and he held up a group of black clowns, standing on
each other’s hands and shoulders.</p> <p>“Capital!” answered
Hamlin. “But look here; I came to tell you something. I want the
address of Miss Brown’s guardian,—you told me there was one,—because I
am going to have Miss Brown educated, with a view, if she do not
change her mind, to her becoming my wife.”</p> <p>Perry let his
scissors fall on the floor.</p> <pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7107-158"/>
<p>“Damnation!” he cried.</p> <p>Hamlin picked up the scissors and put
them quietly on the table.</p> <p>“So that’s it!” burst out
Perry. “While I was bothering my brains with trying to take care of
Anne, you were being inveigled by that cursed hypocritical slut.”</p>
<p>“I shall be obliged to you to speak in rather different language,
Perry,” said Hamlin, in a tone of voice and with a manner which his
friend was not accustomed to.<corr/></p> <p>“Oh, beast! brute!
seven‐times‐distilled and most‐kickable jackass that I have been,”
moaned Perry, “that I should have let this happen to you!—that I
should have let you be entrapped under my very nose! But it mustn’t
be, old fellow; I won’t stand it.”</p> <p>“You will have to,” answered
Hamlin, contemptuously; “and so, let’s say no more about it. Only one
word: Miss Brown has not inveigled me.”</p> <p>Perry gave a sort of
moan of disgust. “No woman ever does inveigle a man!”</p> <pb n="161"
xml:id="VAB7107-159"/> <p>“Miss Brown has not inveigled me. I
conceived the desire of educating her, and giving myself a chance of
marrying her if she would have me, long ago, before I returned to
Florence. And, as a favour, I beg you will respect Miss Brown so long
as she remains in your house, as you would respect the woman who is at
present my ward, and may possibly become my wife.”</p> <p>“Ward! wife!
fiddlesticks!” cried Perry. “For God’s sake, my dearest old Watty,
don’t go and do such a damnable thing! don’t be such an idiot as to
suppose you must do it. That was my confounded folly: let myself be
led on, and then thought it was my own choice, my resolution, all
sorts of fine things. No man ever really wants to tie himself up; it’s
the woman who does it, and makes him believe it’s himself. All this is
bosh, mere bosh; you’ll think better of it.”</p> <p>“I tell you again,
Perry, that there is no inveigling about the matter. I made up my mind
to this step while I was away from<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7107-160"/>
Florence. Besides, I am not going to marry Miss Brown straight off; I
am going to give her the education which such a woman deserves, to
enable her to marry me should she care to do so.”</p> <p>“Education,
forsooth!” groaned Perry; “you will get yourself married before you
have time to say Jack Robinson: and to think that I have brought it
all upon you! to think that I have driven you to do it!”</p> <p>Hamlin
could not help smiling at his friend’s distress.</p> <p>“Really, you
need not feel under any responsibility. I alone am responsible in the
business—I and good fortune, which has brought me into the presence of
the most marvelIous woman that ever was—”</p> <p>“But what do you do
it for? You’re not in love with Annie, I do believe,” cried poor
Perry.</p> <p>“I do it because she is the most beautiful woman I have
ever seen,” answered Hamlin, deliberately; “and the woman who,
properly<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7107-161"/> educated, is of all others
the one whom I should most wish to love—because, in short, I cannot
see her wasted.”</p> <p>Perry flung his arms over his head with a
gesture of grotesque despair. At that moment the door opened, and Mrs
Perry entered the studio.</p> <p>“What is the matter? what has
happened?” she asked with a dramatic gesture, and a not less dramatic
accent; and she remained standing on the threshold, raising the
door‐curtain with much dignity.</p> <p>“Hamlin wants to bring up and
marry Anne Brown,” yelled Perry.</p> <p>Mrs Perry tottered, let the
curtain go, held her hand to her head for a moment.</p> <p>“Anne
Brown—do you hear that? He wants to marry her! to educate her! He has
already proposed!” repeated Perry.</p> <p>Mrs Perry came forward
solemnly, and stretched out her hand to Hamlin.</p> <p>“Dear friend,”
she said softly, “my heart told me that this would be.”</p> <pb
n="164" xml:id="VAB7107-162"/> <p>“Fudge!” exclaimed Perry; “if it
did, why the deuce didn’t you interfere?”</p> <p>“My heart told me
this would be. I congratulate you, dearest friend, that you have at
last found the embodiment of your mysterious dreams of beauty. And I
thank you, on my part, for giving me the happiness of seeing that
glorious dethroned goddess reinstated in her rights, and also,”—and
Mrs Perry’s long mouth smiled—formidable like an alligator’s,—“for
giving me the happiness of witnessing a union of mystic perfection;”
whereupon, to Hamlin’s horror, the tall and bony lady deposited a damp
kiss on his forehead.</p> <p>“Oh—but—thank you so much!” exclaimed
Hamlin—“I have not asked Miss Brown to marry me; I have only asked her
to let me educate her. I wish her to choose whatever husband may
deserve her.”</p> <p>“And that will be yourself—your noble, darling
self,” beamed Mrs Perry.</p> <p>“I am happy that you approve of my
decision,” said Hamlin, quickly; “and since you<pb n="165"
xml:id="VAB7107-163"/> do, will you kindly tell me the address of Miss
Brown’s—Miss Brown’s guardian?”</p> <p>“Julia, I forbid you,” moaned
Perry feebly.</p> <p>“His address”—answered Mrs Perry blandly, and
taking no notice of her husband—“is Richard Brown, care of Gillespie
Brothers, New Cross. He is foreman at a cannon‐foundry, or a place
where they make torpedoes. I know it’s something murderous and
dreadful.”</p> <p>“Richard Brown, Gillespie Brothers, New Cross,”
wrote Hamlin in his note‐book. “Thank you so much; I shall write to
him at once.”</p> <p>“Oh, idiotic beast that I was!” groaned Perry,
“to think that it should all be my fault.”</p> <p>“Come into my
boudoir,” said Mrs Perry; “you shall write to him without a moment’s
delay. Denrest Mr Hamlin, it is so noble, so lovely on your part; and
dear Anne—how beautiful she will become!”</p> <p>Perry paced up and
down the room in violent despair, kicking at all the chairs and easels
on his way, and hurling a tin of black<pb n="166"
xml:id="VAB7107-164"/> paint against the ceiling, whence, having
deposited its oozy contents, it slowly descended. After this, feeling
that his despair was not yet vented, he stalked off to the German
beer‐cellar, in the Via Lambertesca, and gloomily consumed a <foreign
xml:lang="ger">bock</foreign>—a proceeding to which he invariably
resorted whenever his wife had inspired him with a more than usually
strong wish to drown himself.</p> <p>Suddenly an idea struck him, and
he rushed to the nearest telegraph‐office.  There he spent upwards of
an hour, and consumed many pieces of paper in concocting a missive
which should, within the compass of twenty words, convey to Mr Richard
Brown, care of Gillespie Brothers, New Cross, that the proposal being
made to Anne Brown by a certain person must be immediately rejected,
as its acceptance would bring ruin, dishonour, and misery on all
parties. “Proposal disastrous snare,” wound up Perry at last in
triumph; and then discovered that, in his zeal for Hamlin’s good,<pb
n="167" xml:id="VAB7107-165"/> he had expressed disapprobation to the
extent of exactly twenty francs of Italian money.</p> <p>“Nothing but
pipes—loathsome, smelly, filthy pipes; never a cigar—for the next two
months,” meditated Perry, as he paid his money and received the
clerk’s receipt; “but a fellow must save his friend after all.”</p>
</div> <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7107-166"/> <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER VII.</head> <p><hi>NO</hi> arrangements could be come to
until Hamlin should hear from Anne Brown’s guardian, and this, even by
return of post, was impossible under a week. And during that week,
Hamlin determined to keep away from the Perrys’ house: the
objurgations of Melton Perry, the congratulations of his wife, the
very tittering of the children, all this vulgar prose had best be kept
aloof from his romance; besides, he was in the ridiculous position
that Anne was, and was not his; that she could no longer be considered
the Perrys’ servant, and could not yet be considered as his
ward. Accordingly, he betook himself for three days to Siena, deeming
it impossible that any answer could come so soon.</p> <pb n="169"
xml:id="VAB7107-167"/> <p>But when Hamlin returned to his lodging in
Florence, on the fourth day after his proposal to Anne Brown—it seemed
to him as if he had proposed to her months ago, nay, as if he had
never existed at all before that proposal—he was told that a gentleman
had called that morning, and had left word that he would return again
later on in the day.</p> <p>“Some confounded painter or poetaster of
my acquaintance,” thought Hamlin, annoyed that any one should call
upon him at this point of his adventure.</p> <p>A little later a card
was brought in to him. The name upon it made him start—a large
shopman’s card, on which was printed, “Richard Brown, New Cross.”</p>
<p>“Ask him to come in,” cried Hamlin.</p> <p>The visitor stalked in:
a tall, burly man, with bushy black hair and beard.</p> <p>“An
insolent cad,” said Hamlin to himself.</p> <p>“Mr Walter Hamlin?”
asked the newcomer, bowing very slightly, and looking down upon Hamlin
from his big, bent shoulders.</p> <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7107-168"/>
<p>“Precisely—and you, I believe, are Miss Anne Brown’s cousin?”
answered Hamlin, stiffening at the other’s free‐and‐easy manner. The
very look of this man rubbed him the wrong way. “Pray, sit down,” he
added, doing his best to be courteous. But the other had already sat
down.</p> <p>“I have come here,” said Richard Brown, in a deep, Scotch
voice, which made a certain abruptness of manner even more offensive
to his host, “in consequence of a telegram which I received from your
friend Mr Melton Perry.”</p> <p>Hamlin turned pale with anger.</p>
<p>“Perry telegraphed behind my back,” he exclaimed—“however, I had
written to you the same day. I presume you know the contents of my
letter?”</p> <p>“I have received no letter from you—I suppose I
started before it arrived,” answered Richard Brown. “Mr Perry
mentioned no letter from you in his telegram, and as I understood from
it that there were plans afoot which concerned my cousin and ward,
I<pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7107-169"/> thought I had best come at once
and inquire into them.”</p> <p>He stopped a moment, and looked Hamlin
in the face, as if to find out what sort of man he might be. He
himself might be any age between thirty and forty, of the darkest
possible Scotch type, sun‐burnt like a bargee, snub of feature, with a
huge, overhanging forehead; he was a man such as Hamlin had never
dealt with—a type which he recognised as having seen among workmen and
Dissenting preachers: ugly, intellectual, contemptuous—the incarnation
of what, to the descendants of Cavaliers and Jamaica planters, seemed
the aggressive lower classes.</p> <p>“I see,” said Hamlin, coldly. “I
am greatly obliged to you for the trouble you have taken. Your
presence here will make it much easier for us to settle all necessary
matters.”</p> <p>“Mr Perry,” went on the visitor, “has given me rather
a confused account of the proposal which I understand you to have made
to my cousin; and I thought it wiser to see<pb n="172"
xml:id="VAB7107-170"/> you before speaking to her. I must therefore
beg you to tell me whether Mr Perry’s account of your proposal is
correct, and also whether you are in earnest in making it.”</p>
<p>“Had you waited for my letter, I think you could have had no
further doubts,” answered Hamlin, with some irritation. “To
recapitulate, then. I proposed to Miss Brown that she should permit me
to take charge of her education for the next two years, and, on her
becoming of age and deeming her studies complete, to place at her
disposal the capital of an income which should enable her to live in a
manner corresponding with the education she had received, and to make
a suitable marriage.”</p> <p>While Hamlin was speaking a sneer came
over his listener’s face.</p> <p>“I am to understand, therefore,” he
said, “that I was misinformed as to this being a proposal of
marriage.”</p> <p>“Pardon me,” corrected Hamlin, gently. “I told your
cousin that I hoped that perhaps, at the end of those two years, or
more, she might<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7107-171"/> feel inclined to
accept me as her husband; but that my particular object was that Miss
Brown should, on coming of age, find herself in possession of a
fortune corresponding to her education, and which should leave her
free to contract whatever marriage she pleased, or to continue
single.”</p> <p>Richard Brown flushed.</p> <p>“In short,” he said,
with a strange irony in his voice, “you offer to provide my cousin
with a competence whereon to live, or get married, after she shall
have remained for two years in your charge. I fully appreciate the
intention of your proposal; and I therefore beg to refuse it.”</p>
<p>The blood rushed to Hamlin’s head. That such an interpretation
should be put upon his words had never entered his mind. It was as if
a whip had whizzed about his ears and cut into his face. His first
impulse was to knock the other down. But the sense of his
misunderstood superiority, superiority unintelligible to his visitor,
restrained him.</p> <pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7107-172"/> <p>“I quite
understand your refusal, Mr Brown,” he answered, “as a result of your
interpretation of the case; and I suppose I have no right to ask you
to see my proposal, except as you would mean it were you to make it
yourself.”</p> <p>Richard Brown turned pale; but he too mastered his
feelings.</p> <p>“If your intention is to marry my cousin, why not
marry her at once?” he asked, with something in his look which
expressed that he felt himself not to be outwitted by a vicious
fool.</p> <p>Hamlin hesitated. He felt that he could never make this
man understand his dreams, his plans of turning Anne Brown into a
realised ideal, of wooing and winning the creature of his own
making.</p> <p>“Because—because,” he hesitated.</p> <p>“Because,”
interrupted Richard Brown, “a man in your position of life cannot
marry a girl like my cousin before she has been turned into a lady;
and because, even if this be granted, he cannot bind himself to marry
her<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7107-173"/> until he see whether schooling
has succeeded in making a lady of her. I perfectly follow your
reasons; but you also can follow mine when I say that my cousin cannot
be subjected to the ups and downs of your appreciation.”</p> <p>In
this man there was a hatred of Hamlin, not merely as a fine gentleman,
an idler, but as an æsthete; a hatred not merely of class, but of
temperament.</p> <p>“You misunderstand my motives,” answered Hamlin,
losing patience. “My reason for not marrying your cousin at once is,
that I would not marry a woman who cannot possibly love me as yet; and
my reason against a formal engagement between us is, that I cannot
consent to bind Miss Brown to marry me when she has no opportunity as
yet of choosing a man more to her taste. It seems to me,” added
Hamlin, feeling the advantage on his side, “that to take your cousin
in marriage now, or to bind her to marry me in the future, would be
buying her in exchange for the education and the money which she will
receive<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7107-174"/> from me. That education and
that money are intended to secure her freedom, to secure her choice of
a man whom she may love, not to make her into the chattel of a man
whom she could only despise.”</p> <p>Hamlin’s tone and these
sentiments, which seemed to belong to a world west of the sun and east
of the moon, evidently impressed Anne’s guardian. He remained silent
for a moment, unable to realise Hamlin’s state of mind, while no
longer able to disbelieve in it. But the temptation to disbelieve in
the sincerity of this handsome, effeminate, æsthetic aristocrat was
too strong.</p> <p>“All this is very noble and chivalric,” he said,
“and I doubt not quite natural in a poet like you, Mr Hamlin; but for
us practical people, I fear it won’t do. I am fully persuaded of the
desirability of giving my cousin some further schooling, and fully
persuaded also of the undesirability of leaving her any longer in the
care of Mr Perry. So I shall take her back to England with me.”</p>
<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7107-175"/> <p>Hamlin turned pale with
anger. It sickened him to see his plans dragged in the mire of this
fellow’s suspicions, and at the same time he felt unable ever to make
him understand, utterly helpless in defending himself. Suddenly an
idea struck him.</p> <p>“I see,” said Hamlin, rising and leaning
against the fireplace, while his guest remained coolly seated—“I see
that, in plain words, you suppose that I project settling some money
upon your cousin, with a view of making her my mistress for two
years—that is it, is it not, Mr Brown?”</p> <p>The brutal frankness
staggered Brown; it was impossible to make any more insinuations
now. And he began to feel ashamed of those which he had already
made. His own imagination, then, was less clean than the intentions of
this womanish fine gentleman?</p> <p>Perhaps for this very reason he
answered calmly, but turning very red—</p> <p>“Yes, sir; that is
exactly the state of the case.”</p> <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7107-176"/>
<p>Hamlin felt a sort of triumph at this humiliation of his
visitor.</p> <p>“In that case,” he said, “I think I can devise a plan
which shall satisfy you—which will relieve your apprehensiveness. I
offer not merely to settle upon Miss Brown the capital of five hundred
a‐year, to be administered by you until her majority; but also to give
you my word of honour to marry Miss Brown at any time that she may
summon me to do so.”</p> <p>Richard Brown was taken aback; all this
romance, which he had believed to be but a vicious snare, was then
real.</p> <p>“I don’t understand you,” he said. “I don’t understand
what you want to do with my cousin.”</p> <p>“It seems difficult to
explain it to you, Mr Brown,” said Hamlin; “still, I may repeat it. I
wish Miss Brown to receive all the advantages of education and money
which a woman gifted like her has a right to, and which will enable
her to freely marry a man worthy of her—<pb n="179"
xml:id="VAB7107-177"/> myself, or any other in the world. I will not
hear of binding Miss Brown to me at present, either by marriage or by
promise of marriage; she is to remain absolutely independent. But I
offer once more to pledge myself to marry her whenever she may wish
it.”</p> <p>Brown did not answer for a moment.</p> <p>“Are you ready
to sign a document to that effect?” he asked.</p> <p>“I will give Miss
Brown my word,” answered Hamlin, contemptuously; “and I will give you,
Mr Brown, as many signed documents as may be equivalent thereto in
your eyes.”</p> <p>Brown felt the insult, but he knew he had drawn it
upon himself. For a moment he hesitated; his aversion to Hamlin and
Hamlin’s plan fighting painfully with his sense of the worldly
interests of his ward. At last he said—</p> <p>“On these conditions I
can no longer make any opposition; and it rests with my cousin to
accept or refuse your offer. I can only warn her and you—and to do so
is my<pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7107-178"/> duty, I think—that, in my
opinion, such an arrangement is utterly undesirable for both parties,
and that my strong advice is not to enter upon it.”</p> <p>“I take
your warning to heart,” answered Hamlin, contemptuously; “but I cannot
agree with it. May I beg you to meet me at the English Consulate
to‐morrow morning, to witness the document which you proposed I should
draw out; the matter of her money settlement I shall leave in the
hands of my lawyers. What hour will suit you? and may I have the
pleasure of receiving you to breakfast with me and Mr Perry, who will
doubtless be my witness?”</p> <p>Richard Brown bowed.</p> <p>“Thank
you,” he said briefly; “I think I should prefer breakfasting at my
inn. With regard to the document, I shall be happy to meet you at the
Consulate any time convenient to yourself. But,” and his face became
as threatening as his voice was studiously courteous, “we must first
hear whether, on<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7107-179"/> second thoughts, my
cousin accepts your proposal. Good afternoon, Mr Hamlin.”</p> <p>“Good
afternoon,” answered Hamlin.</p> <p>Richard Brown’s visit had left a
nauseous taste in his soul.</p> </div> <pb n="182"
xml:id="VAB7107-180"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
<p><hi>LATER</hi> in the afternoon Richard Brown called at the Perrys’
and asked to see his cousin. He was received with effusiveness by Mrs
Perry.</p> <p>“So you have seen our noble, darling Hamlin,” she cried;
“and you have felt your heart go out to meet him as we have felt
ours.”</p> <p>“I have seen Mr Hamlin,” answered Brown roughly, not at
all appreciating the lady’s winning manners; “and I should like to
speak to my cousin, please.”</p> <p>“Anne—my beautiful Anne”—cried Mrs
Perry, opening the door of the next room.</p> <p>“Poor child!” she
added, “how she has been trembling in her heart all day!”</p> <p>Anne
entered. She was paler even than<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7107-181"/>
usual, and was more than usually self‐possessed. She had seen her
guardian for a minute early that morning, and she knew that this visit
would seal her fate.</p> <p>“Good afternoon, Richard,” she said
briefly.</p> <p>Brown looked round at Mrs Perry, waiting for her to
withdraw. But such was by no means her intention.</p> <p>“Don’t be
unhappy, darling,” she said to Anne; “I know how one woman always
longs for another woman in these moments. I will stay with you while
your cousin tells you the result of his visit.<corr>”</corr></p>
<p>“It is very kind of you, madam,” said Brown gruffly, “but I think
this matter had better be settled solely between my cousin and
myself. Would you permit her to take me into some other room?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I don’t wish to intrude,” sighed Mrs Perry, “I only wished to
support this poor child with my presence. But after all, a woman who
loves requires support from no one.” Saying which she swept out of the
room.</p> <pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7107-182"/> <p>There was a moment’s
silence.</p> <p>“I have been to Mr Hamlin’s, Anne,” said Brown
briefly, seating himself by the fire.</p> <p>“Well?”</p> <p>The tone
of voice was so resolute and even triumphant that he raised his head
and looked up at her where she was standing by the table, a piece of
needlework still in her hands.</p> <p>“Well,” answered Brown quietly,
and watching the effect of each of his words on the pale, melancholy,
but dispassionate face of the girl, “I have spoken to Mr Hamlin; and I
find that you were correct in your judgment, and that I was mistaken
in mine. He is in earnest in his proposal, and honest in it.”</p>
<p>“I knew that;” and Anne Brown wondered whether this could be the
same cousin Dick who was a big boy, almost a man, when she was a tiny
mite at Spezia; who took care of her when her mother was ill and her
father was drunk; who used to shoulder his uncle and drag him off to
bed when, in a fit of<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7107-183"/> intoxication,
he would come in and threaten to throw the babies out of the
window. She recognised the small features, the dark skin and hair, the
heavy intellectual brow; but he seemed to have changed in expression,
to have grown hard, and arrogant, and coarse.</p> <p>“I knew that,”
she repeated, “though you would not believe it. So,” she added, with a
certain hardness in her manner, “I suppose I am left free to decide,
and that you are ready to let Mr Hamlin do what he chooses.”</p>
<p>“You are free to decide,” he answered. “Mr Hamlin, as I have said,
is serious and honest, and willing to make every provision which can
bind him and leave you free, legally. I cannot, as your guardian, say
no. But,” and his voice assumed a threatening tone, “as your kinsman,
and as the representative of your father, I most earnestly dissuade
you from accepting this proposal.”</p> <p>Anne reddened. “But you can
no longer oppose it,” she said quickly.</p> <p>“I have told you before
that you are free,<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7107-184"/> Anne. And because
you are free,” continued Brown, a sort of despair coming over him at
the sight of the girl’s indifference—“because you are free, I want you
to listen to me. This proposal is one which, in the eyes of the world,
will change your life for the better: you will be educated, get the
manners of a lady, be rich yourself, and marry a rich man. But will
you stand higher in your own opinion? Would you stand as high as you
should in that of your father, if he were alive? You, having bartered
your freedom, having accepted all from this one man?”</p> <p>Anne did
not answer.</p> <p>“Of course,” went on Richard Brown eagerly, “you
will have every worldly advantage. But will you be happy taken out of
your own sphere of life, knowing yourself to be bound in gratitude to
this man, who will always continue to feel your superior, to look down
upon you as a beggar whom he has fed, or a chattel which he has
bought? This man is, for his class and ideas, honourable: he wishes to
leave you free<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7107-185"/> to marry him only if
you please; he wishes to marry you really and truly. But in reality he
is making you his slave; for how can you refuse him the only thing
which you, my poor Nan, can give him in return for his money? And in
reality he is making you his mistress; for what sort of marriage is it
which is a marriage merely before the world—where the one buys and the
other is bought?”</p> <p>Anne flushed still deeper, and trembled from
head to foot as she leaned against the table. A dull pain clawed her
at the heart, a lump rose up to her throat. But she did not speak.</p>
<p>Richard Brown misunderstood her silence. He rose and approached the
table, and tried to put his arm paternally on her shoulder. She shrank
back, but let his heavy hand rest on her shoulder. What did his touch
matter when there were his words?</p> <p>“Annie, dear,” said Brown
more gently, “you know I am a rough man, and don’t know how to mince
matters and say things to women; but you know that I am fond of<pb
n="188" xml:id="VAB7107-186"/> you. Don’t you recollect when you were
a wee lassie, and I used to carry you about on my back, and go into
the water to get you the sea‐weeds and the little nautiluses. I
suppose you don’t any longer. But still, you know I would not for the
world hurt my poor little Nan.”</p> <p>Anne held on to the table, and
as she recognised that familiar intonation, hot tears rolled down her
cheeks. Her whole childhood seemed to return to her.</p> <p>“Don’t
cry—don’t cry!” exclaimed Brown, taking her hand. “Poor child! I know
it must be very hard for you who are so young; I know what it must be
to be tempted with a lady’s education, and money, and a fine
gentleman, who’s in love with one, for a husband. But remember what
your poor dad used to tell us, that we common folk must make our own
way—make the others feel that we’re as good as they, and not accept
anything from them. D’you remember how he used to say to me, ‘Work and
be proud’? Well, and I<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7107-187"/> have worked
and have been proud, and it’s that that has enabled me to rest a
little. And you, too, must be proud, and work, my little Annie.”</p>
<p>“Look here,” he went on, “you must not think you are never to be
anything but a servant. I feel I’ve been to blame, and neglected you
too long. You see, I’ve had to work hard for my life, out in England;
but now I am quite safely off—indeed much better off than I ever
anticipated: my employer is going to take me into partnership next
year. Well, since you wish to go to school, I will send you there. You
shall come back with me to England, and I will send you to the very
best school to be found: you shall be as good as any lady, and you
shall owe nothing to any one. Annie, do say yes.”</p> <p>He spoke,
this rough man, almost as one might to a sick child; and as he spoke,
he tried to pass his arm round the girl’s waist. But Anne shuddered,
and freed herself from his grasp. There was something in this big
dark<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7107-188"/> man, with his bushy hair and
beard, which made her shrink physically, although she felt no
suspicion of him morally.  The thought of Hamlin passed across her
mind—Hamlin, who was everything which Richard Brown was not.</p>
<p>“You are very good, Dick,” she said, feeling ashamed of her
ingratitude; “but—but—oh no, no, I can’t, I can’t!” and she hid her
tears with her hands.</p> <p>“Can’t what?” exclaimed Brown, and his
voice and face changed; “can’t what?  Can’t accept my offer; can’t owe
anything to me, to your cousin, to the man to whom your father
confided you? No! you won’t be under such an obligation, eh? Nay,
don’t humbug me. You can’t give up the money, the land, the house, the
fine name—all the things which he can give you and I can’t; for I can
only give you an education, and I was such a fool as to think that you
wanted that!” and Brown laughed a loud, bitter laugh.</p> <p>“You want
to marry that man,” he went<pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7107-189"/> on
brutally; “well, do so. But remember what marriage means. You are a
girl of the people, who has had to take care of herself—not a fine
young lady, as yet, thank God, with all the fine names which fine folk
have for nasty things. You know what marriage means. It means being a
man’s chattel, more than his beast of burden, his plaything, the toy
of his caprice and sensuality. It means, also, that you must smother
all love for a worthier man, or degrade yourself in your own
eyes. Will you be this, sell yourself thus—?”</p> <p>“Mr Hamlin does
not wish me to degrade myself,” cried the girl. “He respects me,—yes,
he does; and you—you don’t!”</p> <p>“He respects you!” sneered
Brown. “And he does not want to degrade you. Of course, he’s a
respectable, highly moral man. But, upon my soul, I would rather you
had been seduced by a man you loved, than that you should have sold
yourself coldly in this way.”</p> <p>Anne felt herself choking. For a
moment she could not utter a word. Then suddenly,<pb n="192"
xml:id="VAB7107-190"/> with a strange look in her eyes, she cried, in
a tone which smote her cousin on the mouth—</p> <p>“I love him!”</p>
<p>Brown turned and looked her in the face. She was very flushed, and
her slate‐grey eyes gleamed feverishly. But her face was calm, and she
returned his taunting gaze, which sought for the proof that she lied,
with a look of irrepressible contempt.</p> <p>“I love him!” she
repeated.</p> <p>Brown took his hat.</p> <p>“Good‐bye,” he said,
stretching out his hand; “I left the choice in your hands, and you
have chosen. To‐morrow morning I shall settle everything with Mr
Hamlin—the papers, I mean—which shall make him henceforth your sole
protector. Then I shall go. Goodbye. I wish you joy of your choice”—he
paused—“you mercenary thing!”</p> <p>Anne did not move.</p> <p>Richard
Brown had already turned the handle of the door when he stopped. “One
thing more,” he said, “which I desire you<pb n="193"
xml:id="VAB7107-191"/> to know. You have taken care of yourself
hitherto, and you are prudent enough in all conscience, and world‐wise
enough, and heartless enough, to do so in future; so this piece of
information may be of use to you. To‐morrow he will sign a paper,
which I shall keep till you come of age, declaring that, although he
leaves you complete freedom in the choice of a husband, he binds
himself to marry you whenever you may call upon him to do so. You will
doubtless know how to turn this to profit. Good‐bye.”</p> <p>Anne sank
into a chair, excited, exhausted, all her blood in movement, she
scarcely knew why—insulted, maligned, and yet with a great sense of
joyfulness in her heart.</p> </div> </div> <pb n="195"

I.</head> <p><hi>A MONTH</hi> later, the little Perrys were being
taken for their walk in the Boboli Gardens by a Swiss <foreign
xml:lang="fre">bonne</foreign> in a quilted cap; and Anne Brown was
unpacking her things in a room overlooking the yellowish‐green Rhine,
with its oscillating bridge of boats, and facing the rocks and
bastions of Ehrenbreitstein.</p> <p>When Richard Brown had returned to
England with the signed documents in his pocket, Hamlin had
immediately written two letters,—one to his lawyers, instructing them
to settle the capital of five hundred a‐year, that is to say, one
quarter of his property, on Anne Brown; the other, narrating the
history of his engagement (if engagement it might be called), to the
widow of his former tutor, and asking<pb n="198"
xml:id="VAB7107-194"/> her to admit the young lady in whom he was
interested into her school at Coblenz.  It was the Easter holidays,
and Mrs Simson had taken advantage of the fact to come to Florence in
order to take back her pupil herself.</p> <p>There was still a
fortnight before the school would reopen, so Hamlin suggested that
they should slowly travel north, and it was settled that he should
accompany the schoolmistress and his ward. The greater part of that
fortnight was spent at Venice, where Anne Brown had never been, and
Hamlin parted company from them to return to England, only at
Munich.</p> <p>Mrs Simson was of that particular type of Englishwoman
which, however much it may marry, always seems to remain an old maid;
but an old maid whose old‐maidishness is an incapacity of feeling any
difference of age between herself and her youngers, of maintaining any
stateliness of superior age and experience: a hopeful, believing,
shrewd, happy‐go‐lucky, enthusiastic creature, invariably making<pb
n="199" xml:id="VAB7107-195"/> one think of a remarkably good‐natured
old grey mare. Youth was the greatest attraction in the world to her,
and she identified herself completely with the young women that came
under her influence. Hamlin had known her in his boyish days, and
lately, passing along the Rhine, had stayed with her for a day or two
in her old‐fashioned house by the confluence of the Rhine and the
Mosel. The impression that this school was so utterly unlike any of
the girls’ schools he had read of in novels; the impression that a
young woman might develop there into whatever pleasant thing nature
intended,—had been so strong, that from the moment of his first
contemplating a possible marriage with the Perrys’ servant, Mrs Simson
and her school at Coblenz had formed an essential part of his
plans. The lady, on the other hand, was exactly the kind of woman to
whom a situation like this would appeal: Hamlin, whom she had
entertained on buns and ginger‐beer, and then, in later years, raved
over after the first sonnet which he sent to<pb n="200"
xml:id="VAB7107-196"/> the ‘Athenæum,’ had always been her especial
object of adoration; and his adoption of a beautiful and strange young
woman, his preparation of a bride for himself, was for her the
finishing touch to his perfection. She would indeed have preferred had
Anne Brown been small and fair, and garrulous and impish, and shown a
love for mathematics and flirtation; but, nevertheless, Anne Brown,
inasmuch as she was the elect of Walter Hamlin, and inasmuch as she
was a beautiful young creature, immediately won the facile but not
fickle heart of Mrs Simson. The whole business seemed to her as
natural as possible; and it was she who proposed that Hamlin should
accompany her and his ward part of their way northwards.</p> <p>What
was Anne’s own condition? During those hours in the train, when Hamlin
was for ever jumping out and overwhelming them with coffee and stale
cakes and newspapers at every station; during those days at Venice,
when they stayed at the same hotel (the headwaiter quite spontaneously
wrote “Mrs Simson<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7107-197"/> and niece” in the
strangers’ book), and spent their days in picture‐galleries and
churches and gondolas, and their evenings at theatres,—during all that
journey Anne was as cold, and silent, and melancholy as she had been
when first they had met at the Villa Arnolfini; indeed any man but
Hamlin, and any woman except Mrs Simson, would probably have been
disheartened and disgusted by this apparent stolidity of
behaviour. But Mrs Simson had already made up her character of Anne
Brown, and fallen in love with it quite independent of realities; and
Hamlin was rather pleased that the creature whom he was going to teach
how to think and how to feel, did not manifest any particular mode of
thinking and feeling of her own. So they were both extremely assiduous
to Anne Brown, and in reality thought much more about what she was
going to be than about what she actually was.</p> <p>The fact was that
the poor girl was in a dazed condition—that all this journey seemed<pb
n="202" xml:id="VAB7107-198"/> to her unreal, and all the things
around her unsubstantial. Her head felt hollow, she seemed to be
informed about her feelings rather than to experience them, her own
words sounded as if through a whispering‐gallery. A couple of weeks
ago she had had so strong a consciousness of identity and existence,
of her own desires and hopes; now she could not well understand how
she came to be where she was. Sometimes, while mechanically talking
with her companions or walking in their company, she used to ask
herself how it had all come about, and then she could see no reason
for it all; it seemed accidental, inexplicable, causeless, and almost
incredible. Whenever, on the other hand, she awakened to the reality
of things, she was depressed by a sense of transition; she was afraid
of speaking, and almost of feeling. As long as she had been the
Perrys’ servant, she had experienced no shyness with Hamlin; as far as
her taciturn nature would allow, she had spoken out whatever she had
thought or<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7107-199"/> felt, without considering
whether or not it might surprise, annoy, or amuse him. Now, on the
contrary, she gradually became conscious of a fear lest Hamlin should
have cheated himself in choosing her. Unable to tell any one of this
feeling, she let it overshadow her. One evening at Munich, two or
three days before they parted company with Hamlin, Mrs Simson, coming
into Anne’s room, found the girl seated with her head in the pillows
of her bed, sobbing.</p> <p>The excellent and somewhat romantic heart
of the schoolmistress immediately melted at this sight.</p> <p>“My
dear child,” she cried, looking more than ever like a friendly grey
old mare, “what is the matter with you?”</p> <p>But Anne merely buried
her head deeper in the pillows, and sobbed harder than before.</p>
<p>“What is the matter?” repeated Mrs Sireson, laying her hand on
Anne’s shoulder.</p> <p>“Oh, leave me, leave me!” moaned the girl.</p>
<p>Mrs Simpson gently passed her arm under<pb n="204"
xml:id="VAB7107-200"/> the prostrate girl’s breast, and lifted her up
from the bed.</p> <p>“What is the matter with you, my dear?” she
asked.</p> <p>“Nothing—nothing,” sobbed Anne, trying to hide her
cried‐out eyes with her hands.</p> <p>“Nonsense; nothing!” said Mrs
Simson, briskly. “You are unhappy about something, you poor little
thing.”</p> <p>Girls, and especially girls in distress, invariably
appeared little to Mrs Simson, even when, like Anne Brown, they
overtopped her by a good head.</p> <p>“Something is the matter with
you,” she insisted. “Now just let us see together what it may be;” and
she made the reluctant girl sit down by her side on the sofa. “Are you
homesick?—do you feel very strange, poor dearie, with strange people?—
are you frightened a little by the sudden change in your life?—it’s
very natural, my dear little girl, but you’ll get over it soon.”</p>
<p>Anne shook her head. But the impossibility<pb n="205"
xml:id="VAB7107-201"/> of making Mrs Simson understand what depressed
her, sent the sobs once more into her voice.</p> <p>“No, no,” she
said; “oh no, no—you can’t understand. I don’t feel lonely—I don’t
feel unhappy—but it’s only because Mr Hamlin—”</p> <p>“Because Mr
Hamlin is going away, my dear?” Mrs Simson smiled as she kissed Anne
on the crisp iron‐black hair, for the girl would not loosen her hands
from her face—“Because he is going away? That’s very natural too; but
it won’t be for long, dearest.”</p> <p>Anne broke loose from her
embrace. “It’s not that! it’s not that!” she sobbed; “please go
away—you can’t understand—it’s not that! Oh no, I shall be glad when
he be gone away!”</p> <p>Mrs Simson rose. At first she felt pained,
disgusted; but her frigidness melted with the speedy reflection that
girls don’t know what the matter is with them in such cases.</p>
<p>“Good‐bye, dear,” she said; “I shall send you up some tea in a few
minutes; that will set you all right. But don’t fret because<pb
n="206" xml:id="VAB7107-202"/> Mr Hamlin is going. You will see him
soon again.”</p> <p>“I shall be glad when he is gone!” repeated Anne,
in a paroxysm of grief.</p> <p>It was not a mere foolish, hysterical
falsehood. It was a real relief when, one morning at Frankfurt, Hamlin
was standing on the platform of the station, speaking to them at the
door of their carriage. The guard came to slam the door.</p>
<p>“Good‐bye, Mrs Simson,” said Hamlin. “Good‐bye, Miss Brown.”</p>
<p>“Good‐bye, sir,” she answered, extending her hand.</p> <p>He kissed
it hurriedly. The door was slammed. The train moved on slowly, and
Hamlin walked along its side. Gradually it went quicker and quicker,
and Anne Brown saw Hamlin for a minute on the platform; he was pale,
but radiant. He waved his hand.</p> <p>“<foreign xml:lang="ita">A
rivederci</foreign> !” he cried, waving his hat.</p> <p>A pillar of
the station hid him. Anne turned away from the window and opened a<pb
n="207" xml:id="VAB7107-203"/> book which he had given her. She read
so assiduously all that day, that poor Mrs Simson, who was a sociable
woman, resorted, in sheer despair, to talking with the other
travellers, who stared in puzzled surprise at the tall girl with the
melancholy pale face and masses of crimp black hair who sat opposite
her.</p> <p>When they had got out of the train, rattled over the round
stones of Coblenz, and were finally following the obstreperously
welcoming cook and housemaid up the stairs of Mrs Simson’s house, Anne
felt relieved. And when she had been left alone in her room, she felt
a weight off her. When she had taken some things out of her box, she
went to the window. The last flare of sunset was on the marblelike
brownish‐green swirls of the Rhine; and filaments of reddish gold
streaked the sky above Ehrenbreitstein, whose windows gleamed
crimson. A steamer was puffing and whistling by the wharf; the
trumpets of the <foreign xml:lang="fre">rappel</foreign> shrieked
through the streets and were reechoed from the opposite shore. From
inside<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7107-204"/> the house rose the sound of a
piano; some one was playing Bach’s “Mein gläubiges Herz.”</p> <p>It
was the beginning of a new life. Anne Brown left the window, hung her
clothes in the wardrobe, folded her linen in the drawers. Then she
took from her trunk a framed photograph of Hamlin, and stuck it on her
dressing‐table; he was very handsome, with his straight,
keen‐featured, almost beardless Norman face and waves of light hair:
she looked at it long. Then she dived to the bottom of her trunk and
brought out two little books; the “Petrarch” he had given her at
Lucca, and the volume of his own poems. She sat down by the open
window and began reading them, and glancing at the redness dying away
from river and sky. She felt very solemn and happy.</p> <p>“I must
become worthy of him,” she thought.</p> </div> <pb n="209"
xml:id="VAB7107-205"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
<p><hi>LIFE</hi> was monotonous enough at Mrs Simson’s at Coblenz; but
it was a kind of monotony which to Anne Brown was positively
exciting. It was for her a process of absorption into another class of
life; and as such, represented a daily influx of new ideas and habits,
a daily surprise, effort, and adjustment. By virtue of her
half‐Italian nature, Anne required but little to make her, in
education and manners, a lady. With her wide‐open but rather empty
mind, her seriousness and dignity of person, extreme simpleness, as
the reverse of complexity of character, it was wholly unnecessary that
she should unlearn anything, or even that she should absorb anything
absolutely new; the only thing was to fill up the magnificent
design<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7107-206"/> which already existed in
her. No one ever required to say to Anne, “You must not do, or think,
or say such or such a thing.” She surprised people only by her
timidity, her silence, her passiveness, and by a sort of haughtiness
which accompanied them strangely enough; a certain solemn, and, at the
same time, abrupt way of judging of things and treating people, and
which was the mental counterpart of her look, gait, nay, even of the
folds which her dresses took on her. Ignorant though she was, she
seemed at her ease with the new culture with which she was presented,
just as, for all her habits of waiting on instead of being served, she
seemed at ease in her behaviour. But it was difficult for Anne to tune
herself or get herself tuned to the pitch of the everyday feelings and
life of her companions; she could not understand these young
ladies. The girls at Mrs Simson’s did not exceed half‐a‐dozen, and
they were none of them schoolgirls in the ordinary sense. They were,
like Anne, eccentrically placed young women; orphans, or girls<pb
n="211" xml:id="VAB7107-207"/> whose parents were in the colonies, or
girls who could not get on at home,—girls, all of them, with a certain
pretension to superiority, and a great habit of independence, which
was fostered by the schoolmistress, whose theory was that women could
not possibly be left too much to their own devices.</p> <p>Mrs Simson
was very fond of preaching this gospel of higher education, to the
great scandal of the respectable German matrons whom she visited.
“Narrow‐minded, vicious creatures,” she used to say, who shook their
heads at the young ladies attending public lectures, walking about by
themselves, and flirting in the most stalwart and open manner (quite
unsentimental and unwomanly, said the Germans) with the Prussian
officers. Of these girls two were orphans, and had been sent to
Coblenz as a convenient riddance by their guardians; one had been
deposited in Europe by her parents, to be called for when educated,
and shipped off to New Zealand; one, a huge damsel approaching thirty,
was studying eye‐<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7107-208"/> surgery with a
famous Rhenish oculist; the fifth was going to Girton and was studying
German; the sixth had found her home too much for her, and was
perpetually complaining of the hardness of her fate and the
viciousness of her own character, aspiring to impossible ideals of
knowledge and usefulness and self‐sacrifice, and spending her leisure
making up frocks in which to disport herself at the garrison
balls.</p> <p>Each of them studied whatsoever she thought fit: Greek
and Latin professors, piano and singing masters, German governesses,
were perpetually going in and out of the house; the girls were
continually running to lectures on botany or physiology or comparative
philology, where the youth of the town eyed the <foreign
xml:lang="ger">Schöne Engländerinnen</foreign> with rapture, sending
them anonymous bouquets and verses, and bringing them serenades, and
even, to poor Mrs Simson’s horror, slipping love‐letters of the most
burning description into the door‐hinges. Among these girls poor Anne
would have felt utterly lost, had she not been accustomed for years to
be<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7107-209"/> her own sole company, letting her
life brush by that of other folk, without ever mixing. It seemed to
her quite natural to exchange one kind of isolation for another: to
drudge on at improving her own mind as she had formerly drudged on at
mending the clothes and making the beds of the little Perrys,
interesting herself as little in, and awakening as little interest
among, her companions as she had done among her fellow‐servants in
Italy. Mrs Simson had received full instructions from Hamlin as to all
the things which she was and was not to teach or have taught to his
ward; and Anne would have been perfectly satisfied with working for
her French and German masters, preparing her lessons of geography and
history, and reading such books as Hamlin would send her, but the
other girls were not at all so minded.</p> <p>Anne Brown’s arrival
created a tremendous sensation in Mrs Simson’s establishment. Her
strange kind of beauty, which did not strike the conventional
spectator as being beauty<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7107-210"/> at all,
excluding, as it did, fairness, rosiness, youthfulness, daintiness,
liveliness, voluptuousness, sentimentalness, or any of the orthodox
ingredients of female charm,—her wholly unlike‐everyone‐else
appearance, her silence, sullenness, haughtiness, all took the girls
by surprise. Her shyness, ignorance, newness in her position, was
obvious from the very first day. The knowledge of what she had been
and what she was going to be, all this romance was quickly wheedled
out of Mrs Simson by the misunderstood little girl who wished to turn
sister of mercy, and carried on a simultaneous flirtation with a
lieutenant, a Bonn student, a painter, and a piano‐master; and bullied
out of her by the bouncing amazon who talked about nothing but retinal
impressions and optic nerves. From that moment Anne became a subject
of intense interest at the school: most of the girls had heard of
Hamlin in England, and all of them had heard of him from the
enthusiastic schoolmistress. To possess in their midst his chosen one
was a great privilege,<pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7107-211"/> although they
sometimes made fun of Anne and him behind her back, drawing pictures
of the solemn and tragic girl dressed in the most draggled æsthetic
manner, surrounded by a circle of young æsthetes copied out of ‘Punch’
(Bunthome did not exist at that time) holding lilies and swinging
censers as she went. They all thought Anne a strange, awe‐inspiring,
and, at the same time, somewhat ridiculous person; but they all got to
like her, although the misunderstood High Church flirt could never be
got to see why Anne should despise officers and garrison balls; and
the scientific girl of twenty‐eight thought æstheticism and æsthetic
poets idiotic and immoral; and each of the others found some
reservation to make about the Italian, as they called her. Yet, as I
said, they did grow to like her; and Anne, who was unaccustomed to
friendliness, was so touched by the familiarity and good‐nature of her
companions, that she gradually began to take a great and serious
interest in their concerns.  She became quite enthusiastic about
ocular<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7107-212"/> surgery, listening with
scarcely any shudders to the narration of the most complicated
operations; she let herself be overwhelmed with discourses about
Middle High German and Gothic, and the connection with Sanskrit; she
firmly believed in the mystical fervours, the desire of
self‐sacrifice, the wasted passion of the little fair‐haired flirt,
reasoning seriously about them, and trying to check what she believed
to be a suicidal tendency; she was greatly touched by the
home‐sickness and family squabbles of the other girls. Not that Anne
was a fool, or made to be a dupe; on the contrary, she saw well enough
the funniness of the contrasts between her friends’ words and their
life; but Anne was so earnest, so simple, so homogeneous of nature,
she was so fervent in all her feelings, that she always imagined that
the serious things which people said or affected must be the reality;
and, as in her own case, the levity, the frivolousness, the
fickleness, must be the mere exterior clothing of social
fictions. Thus she gave her sympathy wherever it was asked<pb n="217"
xml:id="VAB7107-213"/> for, while asking for no sympathy herself. The
girls used often to remark upon this, and complain that for all they
did, Anne Brown remained surrounded by a sort of moral moat, alone,
isolated, impregnable in a kind of moral fortress.</p> </div> <pb
n="218" xml:id="VAB7107-214"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER
III.</head> <p><hi>AS</hi> Hamlin had fancied, while painting Anne’s
portrait, so the girls at Mrs Simson’s used to fancy that there could
not be much going on inside this taciturn and undemonstrative
creature. But it was not so. While Anne looked so quiet, said so
little (and least of all about herself) during those two years of
school, a drama—nay, a whole life‐poem—was incessantly going on within
her. She worked indefatigably at her lessons, read every book she
could lay hold of, was taken to concerts, lectures, burgher
tea‐parties and garrison balls, and on excursions up and down the
Rhine and into the neighbouring hills; but all this was but as an
exterior life surrounding an interior one, as the movement of the ship
to the movement of the passengers on its deck.</p> <pb n="219"
xml:id="VAB7107-215"/> <p>The real life was not with these girls and
these teachers, but with Hamlin; not in this Rhineland town, but in
the distant places where he travelled. He wrote to her very often,
from London, from Italy, from Greece and Egypt, and wherever he roamed
about. At first she was surprised by the frequency of his letters;
then she became accustomed to it as to a necessity of her existence,
but a necessity to which she had no right. It seemed to her wonderful
that he should write so often, and yet that the time which elapsed
between his letters should be intolerable. In her great desire for
them she used to have recourse to all manner of unconscious
sophistications. She tried to train herself to disappointment, to
chastise her own impatience and greediness, saying to herself, on the
days when she thought that a letter might come, “It is impossible that
there should be one to‐day,” although her heart fell when the prophecy
sometimes came true; and she stayed up‐stairs, her eyes pinned to her
book,<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7107-216"/> when she heard the postman’s
ring at the door, although that ring put her all into a tremble, and
made her feel faint when she heard it. Thus with the letters from
him. It was almost worse about her own answers. Often she could stand
it no longer, and would begin a letter to Hamlin—only a few lines,
which might be finished when his next letter should be received. The
few lines turned to pages; yet the next day no letter would come, and
she was unable to resist the temptation of writing even more; then,
when the long‐wished letter at last came, there came with it such a
number of new things to say, that her previous epistle must needs be
torn up. Also, on re‐reading what she had written in answer to Hamlin,
she was often filled with shame and fear. She had entertained him with
such trifles, or been so pedantic, or put things in such a horrid way,
she must needs tear it up and write once more.  Then the length, the
frequency of her letters frightened her: he would grow weary and
impatient; she tried<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7107-217"/> to write
briefly, but failed; she tried to write rarely, making solemn
resolutions to let two, three, or four days pass without answering
him; but it was not of much use. She was dreadfully afraid lest Hamlin
should think her a drag upon him, lest he should write one single
letter more than he would naturally have done, from goodness to
her. She never told him with what tremulous expectancy she waited for
the post; with what heartburn she saw it come empty‐handed; with what
avidity she read his letters, re‐read them furtively by snatches,
carried them about in her pocket, made them last over days, till she
knew them by heart, and, even then, how she was for ever doing up and
undoing again the packet in which she kept them: if he knew that, he
might feel obliged, being so kind, to write oftener; and that must not
be.</p> <p>Any one who had seen these letters which were her soul’s
food, would have been surprised how they could awaken such a longing,
how they could produce such emotion and<pb n="222"
xml:id="VAB7107-218"/> keep alive such passion.  In accordance with
his whole plan of proceedings, Hamlin never once wrote to Anne as if
there were any question of her ever becoming his wife. “My dear Miss
Brown,” they all ceremoniously began, and ended off “Yours sincerely,”
or “Your sincere friend, Walter Hamlin.” Affectionate they were, and
even adoring, in the sense of looking up, or affecting to look up, at
her as a sort of superhuman and wonderful creature, not quite
conscious of its wonderfulness, perhaps, and certainly not responsible
for it; the mental attitude of an artist before a beautiful model, of
some Italian medieval poet before a Platonic mistress. There was not
much perception of the reality of Anne Brown’s personality, nor indeed
of her having any personality at all, being a thing with feelings,
thoughts, hopes, interests of her own. Sometimes even poor Anne felt,
on reading his letters, as if a lump of ice had been laid on her
heart, when she came upon certain sentences; she could scarcely tell
you why, but<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7107-219"/> those sentences made
her feel numb and alone, like a wrecked sailor at the north pole, for
days. Then a reaction came; a burning indignation with herself, a
burning adoration of Hamlin. She felt as if she had done him some
injury; and once or twice, amid tears of shame, she wrote that she had
become unworthy of his friendship—why, she could not well explain. But
she tore it all up, or left only dim hints which Hamlin misunderstood,
and became more respectful and adoring than ever, imagining that he
must have said something to slight her. He really was adoring; it was
such a lovely Madonna this, that it seemed to him that all the most
beautiful and precious things of his mind, and other men’s minds, must
be heaped up before her, like offerings of flowers, and rich
ointments, and jewels, and music. He copied out pages of poetry and
prose in his letters, and wrote to her the most lovely descriptions of
things he saw or things he felt. Whenever he recollected a fine poem,
or saw a beautiful scene,<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7107-220"/> or was
struck by a beautiful thought or a happy expression, he hastened to
offer it to Anne, as the kings of the East offered gold and
frankincense and embroidered raiment to the little Christ.  That this
was the result of his love, she never thought; for she never ventured
to think that he condescended, or even would ever condescend, to love
her; but it was in her eyes the result of his greatness, his
generosity, the <foreign xml:lang="fre">largesse</foreign>, as it
were, of his sublimity. About himself Hamlin would also write a great,
great deal. Of singularly delicate mental fibre, and somewhat weak
will, he was for ever tormented (or pretending to himself to be
tormented, for to be so was pretty well a matter of choice) by
unattainable ideals, by conflicts in his own nature: mysterious
temptations of unspeakable things, beckoning his nobler nature into
the mud, which he never at all specified, but which moved Anne to
agonies of grief and admiration. The poor girl, not understanding how
such things will shoot up in the poetic mind as a result of mere<pb
n="225" xml:id="VAB7107-221"/> reading, and be nurtured there for a
day for the sake of their strange colour, would screw up all her might
to help him, writing to him to be patient, to be strong and bold, to
remember the nobility of his nature,—strange passionately earnest
entreaties written in tears, or in moods like those which send people
to the stake; and which, in their ludicrous disproportionateness to
their cause, would bring the tears to almost any one’s eyes who should
read them.</p> <p>A strange correspondence; and of which Hamlin’s
half, although beautiful with all manner of artistic prettinesses,
would have struck one as the less beautiful and interesting part: the
suppressed passionateness, unconscious of itself, of the girl’s
letters, her mixture of prim literary daintiness, absorbed from her
reading, and of homely, tragically‐hurled‐about imagery (Hamlin used,
without revealing the author, to read out some of these metaphors of
Anne’s to his friends, pointing out their Elizabethan, Webster‐like
character), were much<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7107-222"/> more really
striking. But Anne thought that what she wrote was unworthy to be seen
by Hamlin; his condescension was mere goodness.</p> <p>Hamlin, indeed,
was very good to her—very gentle, courteous, generous, and
assiduous. There was scarcely a book read by Anne Brown which was not
of his selecting; and even in the midst of his journeys he used to
elaborately select things for her reading, cutting out all but a very
few pieces out of books of poetry, and copying and pasting into them
all manner of extracts.  “I should be grieved to think that anything
save the very best should ever be read by you,” he often wrote. Thus,
in the most singular way, Anne, only a nursemaid a few months before,
became more deeply versed in poetry and poetical and picturesque
history than most girls; Greek lyrism, Oriental mysticism, French
æstheticism, but above all, things medieval and pseudo‐medieval;
imbued with the imagery and sentiment of that strange eclectic school
of our days which we still call pre‐Raphaelite. And<pb n="227"
xml:id="VAB7107-223"/> such an education, while putting her in
complete harmony with Hamlin’s aspirations and habits, also brought
home to her the merit of Hamlin’s own work. Of his pictures, she had,
indeed, only vague recollections, besides the little sketches,
wonderful jewel‐coloured things, full of poetic suggestion, which he
would send her at Christmas and on her birthday, to the amazement of
the whole school. But he sent her a good deal of his poetry, and that
only of the best. She did not always understand exactly the things to
which he alluded, seeing only the beauty, the vague passionate
wistfulness, the delicate sadness of what he wrote. His greatness
perfectly confounded her. She found allusions to it in everything: in
reading of dead poets, of Shelley, Keats, Goethe, a kind of passionate
interest thrilled through her, for she seemed to be reading about
Hamlin.  And the same held good as to artists; they were all his
kinsmen, of his blood—nay, they all, in a mystic manner, foreshadowed
him.</p> <pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7107-224"/> <p>Of these matters she
never spoke to any of the girls. But often, while walking with them,
her pride would swell with the thought that she belonged to him—that
he had chosen her. And when the New Zealander, who was musical and had
a fine voice, used sometimes to sing Schumann’s song, “Er der
herrlichste von allen,” the words and the music sent a flood of love
and pride to her heart; it was he, “he the most glorious of all,” who
was thus gracious and good to her.</p> </div> <pb n="229"
xml:id="VAB7107-225"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
<p><hi>THUS</hi> one year went by; and then, slowly, another, while
Anne Brown was being transformed from a nursemaid into a lady. Hamlin
saw her twice during that time. Once, while Mrs Simson and Anne were
staying in Paris—for he had begged that her holidays might be spent
either in Switzerland, or in some place where she might see pictures
and statues—when he suddenly turned up for a day on his way from
England to Greece; and once at Coblenz. Mrs Simson was giving a party:
suddenly into the parlour, filled with German matrons and damsels,
with a sprinkling of professors and soldiers, was introduced a slight,
fair man, who looked very young till you saw him closely, and at whose
sight that<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7107-226"/> sombre, quiet, strange,
half‐Italian girl had suddenly turned crimson, and clutched a chair,
as if afraid to fall, while the company stared and whispered.  Hamlin
left that same evening; and as the day in Paris had been spent in
seeing and talking about pictures, so this afternoon passed in
trifling conversation at Mrs Simson’s table. Alone, Anne scarcely saw
him for an instant. Only, when he left Coblenz, he seized her hand as
he stood at the door, and kissed it fervently. It seemed to her,
during the long months of absence, that she would give all her life to
see him again, to be able to tell him how grateful she was to
him. Yet, in reality, his presence passed like the picture of a
magic‐lantern on a wall; and she felt as if her lips were glued
together: it was a vision, and no more. But on that second visit
Hamlin had been dazzled. He had recognised from the first the exotic
beauty and strangeness of the Perrys’ servant; he had seen in Paris
that his judgment had been correct; but when, after eighteen months of
schooling, he<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7107-227"/> suddenly saw Anne
again, it was as if he had never seen her before, a fresh
revelation. A year and a half of a lady’s life, without bodily fatigue
or mental weariness, had developed to the full the girl’s marvellous
beauty: strange, mysterious, amazonian it was as ever; but it was as
the regalness of a triumphant queen by the side of the queenliness of
a deposed Amazon chief. The haughtiness which had struck him in the
nursemaid of the little Perrys, was not diminished, but softened, by a
kind of quiet graciousness and goodness. Hamlin remarked that she
seemed, now that she was no longer humbled and cramped, to have a much
kindlier spirit and a sense of humour which had at first seemed
scarcely to exist, or to exist only in bitterness. But what struck him
most of all was an indefinable change in Anne’s expression: the soul,
which had lain as a tiny germ at the bottom of her nature, had
expanded and come to the surface.  She was as beautiful and singular
as ever, but more manifold and subtle: her mind had increased
threefold. Hamlin<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7107-228"/> went away,
intending that Anne should remain at Coblenz another year. But he
found that his patience, hitherto inexhaustible, had suddenly
departed. He found the time intolerably heavy on his hands. He
travelled about in out‐of‐the‐way countries, having fragmentary
love‐affairs, in a dreamy, irresponsible way, with other women; and
sending Anne more letters than usual, and presents of all manner of
outlandish stuffs—silver ornaments and so forth—which used to create
great excitement at the school; but he fretted with
impatience. Impatience, be it well understood, not to marry Anne, for
he always thought of marriage as the return from, the end of, a sort
of spiritual honeymoon; but impatience to commence that long courtship
which had, from the beginning, been the object of his desires. He grew
tired of their correspondence, found that he had exhausted all the
delights of unconsciously revealed love, love budding and developing
with the girl’s mind. It began to be mere repetition; and he scarcely
knew<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7107-229"/> what to write about now: the
prologue had lasted long enough; the piece must begin.</p> <p>One day,
some two years or so after her arrival at Coblenz, Anne Brown received
a letter in which Hamlin reminded her that she was twenty‐one, and
that his guardianship had consequently come to an end already some
months before; and suggested that, as he heard that her education was
now completed, at least in so far as Coblenz went, he thought that it
might be wiser if she came to England, where she would have better
opportunities of continuing any special studies. Moreover, that his
aunt, Mrs Macgregor, a widow without any children, was coming to
settle in London, and that he thought it might be a good arrangement
that she and Anne should live together, as Anne could scarcely take a
house by herself. What did Miss Brown think of this arrangement? And
would she authorise him to settle everything for Mrs Macgregor and
her? Faintly and vaguely Anne thanked him for his forethought, and
acquiesced in<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7107-230"/> everything which he
might be kind enough to decide upon. She had never realised her
situation, she was not the sort of mind which has clear conceptions of
the future, and she had been far too much absorbed, these two years,
in the unreal present. Besides, Anne felt a confused pain, a
disappointment, which prevented her attending to anything else. Hamlin
had said nothing about himself, not a word as to whether he also would
settle in London, or whether he intended continuing his wandering
life. And she had not the courage to ask him. She was conscious of a
coldness and emptiness in her heart, of the disappointment of some
vague, unspoken hope. But why feel disappointed? or did she really
feel disappointed at all? She believed that she cared for Hamlin only
as for a benefactor, a divinity, a creature who might bestow affection
but could not be asked for it; and this being the case, and knowing
herself to have been perfectly satisfied and happy hitherto,<pb
n="235" xml:id="VAB7107-231"/> she persuaded herself that she really
did not feel disappointed about anything, when Hamlin thus wrote about
her education and her plans and nothing else.</p> <p>But as the winter
drew to a close, there came another letter from Hamlin (all the
intermediate ones had been only the usual talk about himself, and
about books and scenery) telling her that, with a view to her living
with his aunt, he had, as her ex‐guardian (he always spoke of himself
as her guardian, completely ignoring Richard Brown) deemed it wise to
employ part of her capital, which had been accumulating in his hands,
in the purchase of the lease of a house at Hammersmith, which he was
having prepared and furnished against her coming in May. “It is in a
pretty neighbourhood, with the river in front and old houses and
gardens all round,” he wrote. “What determined my choice, as I am sure
it would have determined yours also, is that the house is itself more
than a century and a<pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7107-232"/> half old, and
has some fine trees in the garden.  Flowers seem to grow well, as it
is pretty well beyond reach of smoke. There are also some fine elms
and poplars in front, all along the river‐side, which is
old‐fashioned, and .not yet made into a modern embankment. It is
rather far from the world; but the world is hideous, and the farther
away from it the better, don’t you think? My aunt is busy about the
practical household properties; I am getting in some of the more
useless furniture. If you should dislike the arrangement, it can all
be easily undone. I hope you will not disapprove of this step; the
house is pretty well unique, and I had to decide on taking it, unless
some one else was to snap it up; otherwise I should certainly have
consulted you first. I trust you will forgive me.”</p> <p>Anne put the
letter down, and wondered whether she was dreaming. What was all this
about buying and consulting her, employing her capital? What capital
had she<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7107-233"/> got? What right to be
consulted?  For a moment she felt quite bewildered; and then the full
consciousness of Hamlin’s goodness rushed out and overwhelmed her, and
she let her head fall on her desk and cried for sheer happiness. Then
she thought it must all be a dream, and snatched the letter where it
lay all crumpled, and smoothed it out trembling. Yes, there it all
was. And then, as postscript, came this sentence, which made her heart
leap:—</p> <p>“There are two rooms additional on the garden, having a
separate entrance from the embankment, and which I think you will not
at present require for yourself. Would you perhaps let me rent them
for a studio? My own lodgings are a long way from St John’s House
(that is its name, for it was a priory once); but if I had my workshop
there, I might hope to see you almost every day, if you would let
me.”</p> <p>The first dinner‐bell rang, and Anne, having hastily
washed her eyes and smoothed her<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7107-234"/>
hair, ran down‐stairs, not knowing very well why the bell rang, or
what it was all about. In the sitting‐room she found the girl from New
Zealand, a little nervous creature, whom she had nursed through a bad
fever, in her cold, absent way, and who had conceived a shy, intense
passion for this beautiful strange creature, who seemed to her an
unapproachable being from another world.</p> <p>“I am going away,”
cried Anne—she felt she must say it—“going away from school—to London,
next month.”</p> <p>The thin, nervous, anæmic little girl turned
ashy‐white.</p> <p>“Oh, are you really going?” she exclaimed faintly,
for with Anne disappeared all the poor child’s sunshine and ideal from
this dreary, worse than orphaned life, among girls who had too many
occupations and interests to care for her.</p> <p>“Are you really
going, Annie? . . . Oh, I am so sorry!”</p> <p>“Sorry?” cried Anne;
“it is very nasty<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7107-235"/> of you to be
sorry—I am glad; oh, so glad! so glad!”</p> <p>The little New
Zealander had gone to the window, and was looking through its panes at
the rainy street; she gave a little suppressed sob.</p> <p>Anne felt
as if she had committed a murder. She ran to the window, and seized
the struggling small creature in her powerful arms, and knelt down
before her, clasping her round the waist.</p> <p>“Oh, forgive me!
forgive me!” cried Anne, as the consciousness of the girl’s love,
which she had never before perceived, came upon her, together with the
shame and remorse at her heartlessness; “forgive me, forgive—I am a
brute—a beast —oh dear, oh dear, that happiness should make me so
wicked!”</p> <p>The New Zealander smiled and buried her thin yellow
face in the masses of Anne’s dark crisp hair.</p> <p>“Will you
remember me sometimes?” she asked; “I love you so much.”</p> <pb
n="240" xml:id="VAB7107-236"/> <p>Anne kissed the poor, pale,
tear‐stained cheeks.</p> <p>“Oh yes, I will always remember you,” she
said.</p> <p>But she was already thinking of Hamlin.</p> </div> <pb
n="241" xml:id="VAB7107-237"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER
V.</head> <p><hi>DURING</hi> that last month at school Anne was
indefatigable: in the face of the vague future which was so rapidly
approaching, she felt bound to clutch hold of the present, thinking
that time which was employed in some way went less quickly. The fact
was that she was in a state of great excitement—half impatience and
half terror; she wished the days to go by quicker, and she wished them
to go by slower; she was at once dragged wearisomely, and hurried
along. At length it became a question no longer of weeks but of
days. And then came another letter from Hamlin. He remembered the
desire she had once expressed to go down the Rhine, to be on the sea:
he proposed that she should come through Belgium and cross from
Antwerp to<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7107-238"/> London. “I am sure you
will enjoy it much more than the vile, vulgar, usual route,” he
wrote. But he did not tell her that he was unwilling she should get
any impressions of England before meeting him, however slight they
might be; that he preferred to meet her, in the evening, on the Thames
wharf, to receiving his Amazon Queen, his mysterious and tragic
Madonna, rather than in the shed at Victoria or Charing Cross. Anne
did not care how she was to go: she was to go, to embark on a new
life, to see him, to be seen by him. This thought, which had never
struck her before, began to haunt her now: if he should be disgusted
with her? if he should recognise that he had been mistaken in his
choice?</p> <p>The morning before her departure, Mrs Sireson handed
Anne a letter at breakfast.</p> <p>“Mr Hamlin has sent a girl to fetch
you, dear,” she said.</p> <p>“To fetch me?” cried Anne, in
astonishment.</p> <pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7107-239"/> <p>Mrs Simson
opened the door—“Pray, come in,” she said.</p> <p>A young woman
entered, whose immaculate smartness and cheerful alertness never would
have let one guess that she had just been travelling twenty‐four
hours.</p> <p>“This is Miss Brown,” said Mrs Simson. The girl
curtsied, and waited for Miss Brown to speak. But Anne could not utter
a word.</p> <p>“Mrs Macgregor, Mr Hamlin’s aunt, engaged me as your
travelling‐maid, miss,” said the young woman, handing a note to
Anne.</p> <p>It was from Hamlin, and ran briefly—</p> <p>“MY DEAR MISS
BROWN,—My aunt is unfortunately too delicate to admit of my asking her
to fetch you from Coblenz; but she has engaged the bearer to be your
maid, unless you have some previous. choice at Coblenz, in which case,
please forgive our interference. She is highly recommended, and seems
a good girl, and accustomed to travel. She will telegraph me how you
are from Cologne and Antwerp<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7107-240"/>. I
shall await you Thursday evening on the wharf. Till then,
farewell.—Your sincere and impatient friend,</p> <p>“WALTER
HAMLIN.”</p> <p>For some unaccountable reason Anne felt quite
angry. She did not require any one to travel with her; she did not
want a maid. The very word <term>maid</term> seemed to bring up her
whole past.</p> <p>“You had better go and rest yourself,” she said to
the girl coldly.</p> <p>“How sweet and considerate!” said Mrs Simson,
reading Hamlin’s note.</p> <p>“I don’t want a maid!” cried Anne,
angrily.</p> <p>“A young lady of your age cannot travel alone, my
dear,” answered Mrs Simson, blandly. But Anne felt miserable, she knew
not why, and hated the maid.</p> <p>Presently she went up to her room
to pack her trunk. On opening the door she discovered the maid—her
maid—on her knees, emptying<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7107-241"/> the
chest of drawers, and folding thing after thing.</p> <p>“Please don’t
do that!” cried Anne, turning purple. “I will do it myself,
please.”</p> <p>The girl stared politely, and answered in a subdued,
respectfully chiding tone—</p> <p>“I was only packing your trunk,
miss.”</p> <p>“I will do it myself!” cried Anne, excitedly.</p> <p>“As
you wish, madam,” was the maid’s icy answer; and she rose.</p> <p>“Can
I do nothing for you?” she said, standing by the door, with a
reproachful, prim little face.</p> <p>Anne was ashamed.</p> <p>“You
can help me if you like,” she answered, rather humbled; and she began
folding her things. But the girl was much quicker than she, and Anne
soon remained with nothing to do, looking on vacantly. She felt as if
she would give worlds to get the girl away; she felt as if she ought
to say to her, “Don’t do that for me; I am not a real lady; I am no
better than you; I am a servant, a maid, myself<pb n="246"
xml:id="VAB7107-242"/>,”—and as if every moment of silence were a kind
of deceit. At last she could bear it no longer—</p> <p>“Please,” she
cried, “let me pack my things myself; I have always packed them
myself; I should be so glad if you would let me.”</p> <p>The girl rose
and retired.</p> <p>“As you like, miss,” she replied, fixing her eyes
on Anne’s strange excited face.</p> <p>“She knows I am only a servant
like herself, and she thinks me proud and ungrateful,” thought
Anne.</p> <p>The next evening, among the lamentations of Mrs Simson’s
establishment, Anne Brown set off for Cologne. This first short scrap
of journey moved her very much: when the train puffed out of the
station, and the familiar faces were hidden by outhouses and
locomotives, the sense of embarking on unknown waters rushed upon
Anne; and when, that evening, her maid bade her good night at the
hotel at Cologne, offering to brush her hair and help her to undress,
she was seized with intolerable homesickness<pb n="247"
xml:id="VAB7107-243"/> for the school,—the little room she had just
left,—and she would have implored any one to take her back. But the
next days she felt quite different: the excitement of novelty kept her
up, and almost made it seem as if all these new things were quite
habitual; for there is nothing stranger than the way in which
excitement settles one in novel positions, and familiarises one with
the unfamiliar. Seeing a lot of sights on the way, and knowing that a
lot more remained to be seen, it was as if there were nothing beyond
these three or four days—as if the journey would have no end; that an
end there must be, and what that end meant seemed a thing impossible
to realise. She scarcely began to realise it when the ship began
slowly to move from the wharf at Antwerp; when she walked up and down
the deserted and darkened deck watching the widening river under the
clear blue spring night, lit only by a ripple of moonlight, widening
mysteriously out of sight, bounded only by the shore‐lights, with here
or there the<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7107-244"/> white or blue or red
light of some ship, and its long curl of smoke, making you suddenly
conscious that close by was another huge moving thing, more human
creatures in this solitude,—till at last all was mere
moonlight‐permeated mist of sky and sea. And only as the next day—as
the boat cut slowly through the hazy, calm sea—was drawing to its
close, did Anne begin to feel at all excited. At first, as she sat on
deck, the water, the smoke, the thrill of the boat, the people walking
np and down, the children wandering about among the piles of rope, and
leaning over the ship’s sides—all these things seemed the only
reality. But later, as they got higher up in the Thames, and the
unwonted English sunshine became dimmer, a strange excitement arose in
Anne—an excitement more physical than mental, which, with every
movement of the boat, made her heart beat faster and faster, till it
seemed as if it must burst, and a lot of smaller hearts to start up
and throb all over her body, tighter and tighter, till she had to
press her<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7107-245"/> hand to her chest, and sit
down gasping on a bench.</p> <p>The afternoon was drawing to a close,
and the river had narrowed; all around were rows of wharves and groups
of ships; the men began to tug at the ropes.  They were in the great
city. The light grew fainter, and the starlight mingled with the dull
smoke‐grey of London; all about were the sad grey outlines of the old
houses on the wharves, the water grey and the sky also, with only a
faint storm‐red where the sun had set. The rigging, interwoven against
the sky, was grey also; the brownish sail of some nearer boat, the
dull red sides of some steamer hard by, the only colour. The ship
began to slacken speed and to turn, great puffs and pants of the
engine running through its fibres; the sailors began to halloo, the
people around to collect their luggage: they were getting alongside of
the wharf. Anne felt the maid throw a shawl round her; heard her
voice, as if from a great distance, saying, “There’s Mr Hamlin, miss;”
felt herself walking<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7107-246"/> along as if in
a dream; and as if in a dream a figure come up and take her hand, and
slip her arm through his, and she knew herself to be standing on the
wharf, in the twilight, the breeze blowing in her face, all the people
jostling and shouting around her. Then a voice said—“I fear you must
be very tired, Miss Brown.” It was at once so familiar and so strange
that it made her start; the dream seemed dispelled. She was in
reality, and Hamlin was really by her side.</p> </div> </div> <pb

<pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7107-248"/> <div type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER
I.</head> <p><hi>IT</hi> is sad to think how little even the most
fervently loving among us are able to reproduce, to keep within
recollection, the reality of the absent beloved; certain as we seem to
be, living as appears the phantom which we have cherished, we yet
always find, on the day of meeting, that the loved person is different
from the simulacrum which we have carried in our hearts. As Anne Brown
sat in the carriage which was carrying her to her new home, the
feeling which was strongest in her was, not joy to see Hamlin again,
nor fear at entering on this new phase of existence, but a recurring
shock of surprise at the voice which was speaking to her, the voice
which she now recognised as that of the real Hamlin, but<pb n="254"
xml:id="VAB7107-249"/> which was so undefinably different from the
voice which had haunted her throughout those months of absence. Hamlin
was seated by her side, the maid opposite. The carriage drove quickly
through a network of dark streets, and then, on, on, along miles of
embankment. It was a beautiful spring night, and the mists and fogs
which hung over river and town were soaked with moonlight, turned into
a pale‐blue luminous haze, starred with the yellow specks of gas,
broken into, here and there, by the yellow sheen from some open
hall‐door or lit windows of a party‐giving house: out of the faint
blueness emerged the unsubstantial outlines of things—bushes, and
overhanging tree‐branches, and distant spectral towers and
belfries.</p> <p>“You must be very tired,” said Hamlin.</p> <p>“Oh
no,” answered Anne, that repeated revelation of the real voice still
startling her—“ not at all.”</p> <p>He asked her how she had left
those at Coblenz, and about her journey; she had to<pb n="255"
xml:id="VAB7107-250"/> tell him about every picture and church she had
seen at Cologne, Brussels, Bruges, and Antwerp. It is strange how
people whose hearts have seemed full to bursting with things they have
so long been waiting to say, will talk, when they meet again, like
persons introduced for the first time at a dinner‐party. On they
rolled, and on, through the pale moonlight mist by the river.</p>
<p>“I hope,” said Hamlin, when they had done discussing Van Eyck, and
Rubens, and Memling—“I hope you will like the house and the way I have
had it arranged; and,” he added, “I hope you will like my aunt. She is
rather misanthropic, but it is only on the surface.”</p> <p>His aunt!
Anne had forgotten all about her; and her heart sank within her as the
carriage at last drew up in front of some garden railings. The house
door was thrown open, and a stream of yellow light flooded the strip
of garden and the railings. Hamlin gave Anne his arm; the maid
followed. A<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7107-251"/> woman‐servant was
holding the door open, and raising a lamp above her. Anne bent her
head, feeling that she was being scrutinised. She walked speechless,
leaning on Hamlin’s arm, and those steps seemed to her endless. It was
all very strange and wonderful. Her step was muffled in thick, dark
carpets; all about, the walls of the narrow passage were covered with
tapestries, and here and there came a gleam of brass or a sheen of dim
mirror under the subdued light of some sort of Eastern lamp, which
hung, with yellow sheen of metal discs and tassels, from the ceiling.
Thus up the narrow carpeted and tapestried stairs, and into a large
dim room, with strange‐looking things all about. Some red embers sent
a crimson flicker over the carpet; by the tall fireplace was a table
with a shaded lamp, and at it was seated a tall, slender woman, with
the figure of a young girl, but whose face, when Anne saw it, was
parched and hollowed out, and surrounded by grey hair.</p> <pb n="257"
xml:id="VAB7107-252"/> <p>“This is Miss Brown, Aunt Claudia,” said
Hamlin.</p> <p>The old lady rose, advanced, and kissed Anne frigidly
on both cheeks.</p> <p>“I am glad to see you, my dear,” she said, in a
tone which was neither cold nor insincere, but simply and utterly
indifferent.</p> <p>Anne sat down. There was a moment’s silence, and
she felt the old lady’s eyes upon her, and felt that Hamlin was
looking at his aunt, as much as to say, “Well, what do you think of
her?” and she shrank into herself.</p> <p>“You have had a bad passage,
doubtless,” said Mrs Macgregor after a moment, vaguely and
dreamily.</p> <p>“Oh no,” answered Anne, faintly, “not at all bad,
thank you.”</p> <p>“So much the better,” went on the old lady,
absently. “Ring for some tea, Walter.”</p> <p>Hamlin rang. In a moment
tea‐things were brought. Hamlin handed a cup to Anne, and offered her
some cake.</p> <p>“It is a long drive,” said Mrs Macgregor—<pb n="258"
xml:id="VAB7107-253"/> “a long drive—all the way from Charing
Cross.”</p> <p>“Miss Brown came by the Antwerp boat—St Catherine’s
Wharf—in the City, aunt,” corrected Hamlin.</p> <p>“Ah, yes, to be
sure—perhaps she would like some more milk in her tea. There is always
such a delay at Charing Cross, isn’t there, Walter?”</p> <p>But while
Mrs Macgregor’s mind and words seemed to ramble vaguely about, her
eyes were fixed upon Anne—large, melancholy dark eyes.</p> <p>“You are
glad to be back in London, aren’t you?” she asked.</p> <p>“This is the
first time I am in England,” answered Anne, shyly; all this dim room,
with its vague sense of beautiful things all round, this absent‐minded
lady, all seemed to harmonise with her own dreamlike sensations.</p>
<p>“Miss Brown was born in Italy,” explained Hamlin, probably for the
hundredth time.</p> <p>“Oh yes, of course; how stupid I am! And,<pb
n="259" xml:id="VAB7107-254"/> Walter, there are some letters for you
on the hall table, and Mr Chough came while you were out, and a man
from—what’s his name—the upholsterer who writes poetry.”</p> <p>“All
right,” interrupted Hamlin.</p> <p>“Won’t you have another cup,
Margaret?” asked Mrs Macgregor.</p> <p>“Her name is Anne, auntie—”</p>
<p>“Of course—I don’t know whether you take sugar in your tea or not,
Rachel.”</p> <p>Thus they went on for another half‐hour; Mrs Macgregor
calling Anne by one wrong name after another, alluding to things which
she could not possibly know anything about, and Hamlin trying to set
matters right and induce Anne to talk.</p> <p>“It is getting late,” he
said, “and I fear Miss Brown must be tired after her long journey. I
think you had better not keep her up any longer, aunt.”</p> <p>“I am
not tired,” protested Anne.</p> <p>“You will be tired to‐morrow,” said
the old lady.</p> <pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7107-255"/> <p>“Yes,” added
Hamlin, “and I must go. Good‐bye, aunt. Good night, Miss Brown; I hope
you will have good dreams to welcome you home to England. I shall come
in for lunch to‐morrow, Aunt Claudia. Good night. Good night, Miss
Brown,” and he kissed her hand. “Good night, <foreign
xml:lang="ita">buon riposo e sogni felici.</foreign>”</p> <p>The few
words of Italian almost brought the tears to Anne’s eyes; she felt so
strange here, so far from everything—and yet what had she left behind?
nothing, and no one who loved her, except that little girl from New
Zealand.  She felt terribly alone in the world.</p> <p>Hamlin had
evidently not trusted to his aunt to send Anne to bed, for the maid
came in uncalled, and asked whether Miss Brown would not like to go up
to her room.</p> <p>“Of course,” said Mrs Macgregor; and taking a
heavy old‐fashioned silver candlestick, she led Anne to her room. The
poor girl was too weary and dazed to see what it was like. She sank on
to a chair, and<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7107-256"/> passively let the
maid take off her hat and cloak.</p> <p>“Shall I undress you, ma’am?”
she asked.</p> <p>Anne shook her head. “No, thanks.”</p> <p>The girl
retired, but Mrs Macgregor remained standing by Anne’s side, looking
at the reflection in the glass of her pale, sad, tired face. “Undo
your hair, Eliza dear,” said Mrs Macgregor.</p> <p>Anne mechanically
pulled out the hair‐pins, and the masses of iron‐black crisp hair fell
over her shoulders.</p> <p>The old lady looked at her for a
moment.</p> <p>“You are a beautiful girl, Anne,” she said, at last
hitting the right name, “and,” she added, with a curious compassionate
look, as she kissed the girl’s forehead, “are you really in love with
Watty?”</p> <p>Anne did not answer; but she felt herself redden.</p>
<p>“Marriage without love is a terrible thing,” said the old lady,
“and in so far love is a mitigation of evil; but at the best it is
only<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7107-257"/> delusion. People must marry,
but it is the misfortune of their lives. Good night, my dear.”</p>
<p>The words went on in Anne’s head, but she was too worn out to
understand them. She soon fell asleep, and dreamed that Melton Perry
had painted a picture, and that in a storm the ship’s crew said it
must be used as a raft; and somehow it all took place at Florence, in
the large pond in the Boboli Gardens.</p> </div> <pb n="263"

<p><hi>ANNE BROWN</hi> awoke with a vague sense of gladness, but no
very clear notion of where she was. Then it came upon her that this
was Hamlin’s house, that she would actually see him again in a few
hours; for it was as if she had not seen him at all the previous
evening. The sun was streaming through the blinds, filling the room
with a yellowish light; from without came a sound of leaves, of
twittering birds, and the plash of the steamer‐paddles in the
river. Anne looked round her and wondered. She had never seen such a
room as this in her life: the wails were all panelled white, except
where the panelling was interrupted by expanses of pale‐yellow chintz;
the furniture also was of old‐fashioned chintz; the<pb n="264"
xml:id="VAB7107-259"/> mirror was like what she had seen in the
illustrations to an old copy of ‘Sir Charles Grandison’ which had
belonged to Miss Curzon; the tapered chairs and tables to match. There
were blue‐and‐white jars and pots all about, and old‐fashioned china
things on the dressing‐table: except for the fac‐similes of drawings
by Mantegna and Botticelli, and the coloured copies of famous Italian
pictures which dotted the walls, the room might have been untouched
since the days of the first Georges. She remembered that Hamlin had
told her that the house was an old one; but she could not understand
how everything came to look so very spick and span and new. She got up
and went to the window. Below, in the little garden, was a lilac‐tree
bursting into flower, and a yellow laburnum. A milkman’s cart was
drawn up before the door. In front were the trees, in tender leaf, and
the wooden parapet of the river‐walk; then the Thames, still wide, but
so different from what she had seen it the previous evening: a clear
grey stream<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7107-260"/> reflecting green banks
and cloudy blue sky, with here and there a barge or boat moored by the
shore. The sky was blue, but covered with moist clouds, and it seemed
to Anne that she could almost see where it arose on the horizon, so
low did it seem. There was a scent of recent rain in the air, a
shimmer of moisture on the leaves and grass. Was this London, which
she had always fancied so noisy, and grimy, and vulgarly new?</p>
<p>Anne was already half dressed; but she spent some time wondering
which of her frocks she should put on: they had been made expressly
for London, and greatly admired by the girls at Coblenz, but now one
looked more absurd and frumpish than the other. At last she put on a
sort of greyish‐blue tweed, such as were then worn on the Continent,
and having looked at herself rather anxiously in the glass, she opened
her door and hesitatingly went out into the passage. All was perfectly
quiet as she went down the carpeted stairs, wondering at the tapestry
and brazen wrought shields and<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7107-261"/>
plaster casts and curious weapons which covered its walls; she could
hear only the ticking of the old clock, which stood in its tall inlaid
case in the hall. After the bustle of girls and servants at the
Coblenz school, and the hundred and one noises of screeching
well‐pulleys, whirring buckets, whistling starlings, singing and
chattering servants, clattering crockery, which greet the early riser
in an Italian house,—this silence seemed to her almost eerie, and she
wandered about over the noiseless floors like the knight in the palace
of the sleeping beauty.  She found her way into the drawing‐room,
where she had been received the previous evening; there was another
next to it, and a kind of little library beyond. It was, indeed, an
enchanted palace; the walls were all hung with pictures and drawings,
and pieces of precious embroidery, and burnished oriental plates, and
the floors spread with oriental carpets and matting, which gave out a
faint, drowsy, sweet scent. The curious furniture was covered with old
brocade and embroidery,<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7107-262"/> and in all
corners, on brackets and tables and in cabinets, were all manner of
wonderful glass and china, and strange ivory and inlaid Japanese toys.
There were flowers, also, about everywhere, and palms in the
windows. In the library were more books than Anne had almost ever
seen; and in the chief drawing‐room a beautiful grand piano, not made
like those of our days, but with slight straight legs and a yellow
case painted with faded‐looking flowers. Anne looked at everything
with astonishment and awe: it was like the rooms in Walter Crane’s
fairy books, with their inlaid chests and brocade couches, and
majolica vases full of peacocks’ feathers.</p> <p>It took her a long
time to take it all in. She stole to the piano, opened it gently, and
played the accompaniment of a song of Carissimi’s, which Hamlin was
fond of, but inaudibly, without letting her fingers press down the
keys.  Then she looked at everything once more. She was beginning to
get familiarised with the pictures on the wall; the pale, delicate<pb
n="268" xml:id="VAB7107-263"/> bits of landscape; the deep‐coloured
pictures of ladies in wonderful jewel‐like robes, with mysterious
landscapes behind them; the drawings of strange, beautiful, emaciated,
cruel‐looking creatures, men or women, with wicked lips and combed‐out
locks,—all these things, which were like so many points of
interrogation—when the door opened and the maid appeared.</p> <p>“I
have been looking for you everywhere, miss,” she said. “I thought, as
you didn’t answer when I knocked, that you must still be asleep, so I
carried your tea down again. Mrs Macgregor is going to have breakfast
now, and says, would you mind having it in her room with her, miss, as
she never goes down till lunch?”</p> <p>Anne followed the servant to
Mrs Macgregor’s room, where she found the old lady in her
dressing‐gown, before a table spread with eighteenth‐century china, or
what to Anne seemed such.</p> <p>“What an hour you do get up at,
Charlotte!”<corr/> said Mrs Macgregor, kissing Anne on both
cheeks. “We never think of getting up<pb n="269"
xml:id="VAB7107-264"/> here before half‐past nine.  Walter never comes
in till luncheon‐time, because he has so far to come, and is up so
late every night. Turn round; let me see what you look like this
morning.”</p> <p>And Mrs Macgregor made Anne turn round slowly. She
looked at her approvingly.</p> <p>“You’re a handsome girl, certainly,”
she said; “not the style that used to be admired in my time,”—and she
smiled with the faint smile of an old belle,—“girls had to be slight,
and fair, and with little features then. But you’re just what they
like now. I’m thankful at least that Walter has not brought home a bag
of bones like the other beauties of his set.  <emph>Loveliness in
decay</emph>, that’s what I call their style; but you look a good
flesh‐and‐blood girl.”</p> <p>Anne did not know what to answer; she
poured herself out a cup of tea in silence, and vaguely ate some bread
and butter. The old lady was good‐natured, garrulous, flighty; but
yet, beneath the shiftiness of her exterior, there seemed to be
something real, something<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7107-265"/> sad and
bitter, when you looked at her thin drawn mouth and melancholy
eyes.</p> <p>“That’s a pretty frock you have on, my dear,” she
pursued, “and <emph>I</emph> think it very becoming. But you’ll see
that Watty won’t like it. He’s quite the—what do you call it?—medieval
sort of thing,—no stays, and no petticoats, and slashings, and tags
and boot‐laces in the sleeves, and a yard of draggled train—that sort
of thing. Oh, you’ll find it a queer world, the world of Watty’s
friends. Do you ever see ‘Punch’? That’s the sort of thing. They’re
<emph>all</emph> great beauties and great painters and great poets,
every man and woman of them. Wait till you see little Chough and young
Posthlethwaite (I forget his real name). Ah, well, it’s perhaps
better, after all, this kind of fooling, and masquerading, and writing
verses about things people would horsewhip a man for saying in prose;
it’s perhaps better, after all, for Watty, than the sort of life which
we led when he was young”—and Mrs Macgregor became suddenly very
silent.</p> <pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7107-266"/> <p>After breakfast Anne
was free until luncheon‐time, as Mrs Macgregor proceeded to lie down
on her sofa and read Leigh Hunt’s ‘Religion of the Heart,’ or Fox’s
‘Religious Ideas,’ which Anne saw lying on her table. Hamlin’s aunt
had evidently been an <foreign xml:lang="fre">esprit fort</foreign> in
her youth, and possessed in her bedroom a whole library of what were
once deemed literary firebrands, but might nowadays be described as
mild, old‐fashioned free‐thinking literature. Anne roamed about the
drawing‐room once more, looking again and again at the pictures, and
opening the books, as people do in a strange house, before they can
settle down. She timidly also opened the piano, but shut it again
after a minute. Then she took a volume of Jean Paul out of a shelf,
and carried it up into her room. Finding it too dull to read, and with
an irritating sense that she ought to be doing something definite, she
wrote a letter to Mrs Simson, and one to the little New Zealander. She
felt so much like a fish out of water that Coblenz seemed more than
her<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7107-267"/> birthplace, and the people there
more than mother and sisters. At last she heard one o’clock strike,
and soon after there came a knock at the house‐door, and running to
the window she saw Hamlin standing on the doorstep. She withdrew her
head quickly, and went down to meet him.</p> <p>He was more respectful
than ever,—asked her how she had slept, and what she thought of the
house.</p> <p>“It’s lovely,” said Anne, “and it is so nice having
everything old about one.”</p> <p>“Everything old?” asked Hamlin.</p>
<p>“Yes; all the hangings, and chairs, and tables, and mirrors, are of
the time of the building of the house, aren’t they?”</p> <p>“Oh
goodness, no,” answered Hamlin, sadly; “I only wish they were. They’re
bran‐new, every stick of them. Everybody has them now; nobody makes
anything except imitation old‐world things.”</p> <p>“Why don’t they
try and make something good and new—something out of their own<pb
n="273" xml:id="VAB7107-268"/> heads, as the old workmen did?”  asked
Anne, looking with wonder upon these new things which seemed so
old.</p> <p>“There is nothing to nourish art nowadays,” said Hamlin,
seating himself opposite her and looking her full in the face as he
used to do long ago at the studio in Florence. “Art can’t live where
life is trivial and aimless and hideous. We can only pick up the
broken fragments of the past and blunderingly set them together.”</p>
<p>“But why should the life of to‐day be trivial and aimless and
hideous?” asked Anne, a vague remembrance of things which she had
heard her father say years ago about progress and modern achievements
returning to her mind as it had never done when, in the letters which
he used to write to her at Coblenz, Hamlin had said before what he was
saying now.</p> <p>“I don’t know why it should be,” replied Hamlin,
“but so it is.”</p> <p>“Can’t we prevent it?” asked Anne, scarcely
thinking of what she was saying; conscious<pb n="274"
xml:id="VAB7107-269"/> only that she was really once more in his
presence.</p> <p>Hamlin shook his head sadly.</p> <p>“Why cannot we
revive those?” he said, pointing to a bunch of delicate pale‐pink
roses, which drooped withered in a Venetian glass. “What is dead is
dead. The only thing that remains for us late comers to do is to pick
up the faded petals and keep them, discoloured as they are, to scent
our lives.  The world is getting uglier and uglier outside us; we
must, out of the materials bequeathed to us by former generations, and
with the help of our own fancy, build for ourselves a little world
within the world, a world of beauty, where we may live with our
friends and keep alive whatever small sense of beauty and nobility
still remains to us, that it may not get utterly lost, and those who
come after us may not be in a wilderness of sordid sights and sordid
feelings. Ours is not the mission of the poets and artists of former
days; it is humbler, sadder, but equally necessary.”</p> <p>“Oh, but
you must not say that!” cried<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7107-270"/>
Anne. “What you do will last, don’t you know, like the things which
people were able to do formerly.”</p> <p>Hamlin shook his head, and
remained for some time with his beautiful greenish‐blue eyes fixed on
Anne, as she sat twisting and untwisting the fringe on the arm of her
chair.</p> <p>“There is one consolation, Miss Brown,” said Hamlin,
rising from his chair and leaning against the chimney‐piece, all
covered with Japanese cups and curious nick‐nacks, and not taking his
eyes off her, “and that is, that even now, Nature, which is so barren
of painters and poets, can produce creatures as wonderful as those who
inspired the painters and poets of former times—a consolation, and at
the same time a source of despair.”</p> <p>Hamlin spoke these
lover‐like words in a tone so cold, so sad, that Anne did not at first
understand to whom he was alluding, and looked up rather in
interrogation than in embarrassment.</p> <p>A bell rang. “There’s
lunch,” said Hamlin. “We must finish our discussion afterwards.”</p>
</div> <pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7107-271"/> <div type="chapter">
<head>CHAPTER III.</head> <p>“<hi>WON’T</hi> you take her out for a
drive, Walter?” asked Mrs Macgregor, after lunch. “She must be curious
to see something of London.”</p> <p>Hamlin looked at Anne, as much as
to say, “Do you really wish to go?”</p> <p>“I am sure Miss Brown is
too tired from her journey, aunt,” he said; “and what is there to take
her to see in this beastly city?”</p> <p>“I thought we might have a
brougham and take her to see a few of your friends, Walter,” suggested
Mrs Macgregor.</p> <p>Poor Anne felt a sort of horror go all down
her.</p> <p>“Oh, please don’t!” she cried—“not to‐day; don’t take me
to see any one, please.”</p> <p>“It’s much wiser to let her rest,”
said Hamlin, in a tone of annoyance.</p> <pb n="277"
xml:id="VAB7107-272"/> <p>“Won’t you just take the poor girl to Mrs
Argiropoulo’s, Watty?” insisted his aunt. “It’s a sin to keep her
mewed up at Hammersmith all day; and you know Mrs Argiropoulo was so
anxious to see her at once.”</p> <p>“Confound Mrs Argiropoulo!”
exclaimed Hamlin. “I beg your pardon, Miss Brown, but do you feel
inclined, after your long journey, to go and see a fat, fashionable
lion‐huntress, with a snob of a husband who sells currants?”</p>
<p>“Not at all,” answered Anne, laughing. “I would much rather stay at
home, really.”</p> <p>“Very well; then I will show you the garden and
my studio, if you don’t mind; and a great friend of mine, Cosmo
Chough,—I think I sent you some of his poems about music. . . .”</p>
<p>“Oh yes,” cried Anne; “they are lovely—”</p> <p>“I think little
Chough’s poems perfectly indecent,” interrupted Mrs Macgregor. “I
would much sooner let a girl read ‘Don Juan,’ or even ‘Candide,’ any
day.”</p> <pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7107-273"/> <p>Hamlin reddened, but
laughed.</p> <p>“Opinions differ; at any rate, Miss Brown knows only
Chough’s best things; and when he is at his best, Chough is really
very good and pure and elevated.”</p> <p>“Ah, well,” merely remarked
Mrs Macgregor.</p> <p>“Cosmo Chough said he would look in about four,”
went on Hamlin. “He is a strange creature, and sometimes says odd
things.”</p> <p>“Very odd things,” put in his aunt.</p> <p>“But he is
as pure‐minded a man as I know, and a real poet,” went on
Hamlin—“indeed quite one of the best; and he is a great musician, and
a most entertaining fellow—his only weakness is that he is a great
republican and democrat, but would like to be thought the son of a
duke.”</p> <p>“The son of a duke? ” asked Anne, in surprise.</p>
<p>“Oh, the natural son, of course—forgive me, my dear,” said Mrs
Macgregor.  “People nowadays like anything illegitimate—it’s a<pb
n="279" xml:id="VAB7107-274"/> distinction. It wasn’t in my day, but
things have changed; and Mr Cosmo Chough would dearly like to be
thought a bastard, especially a duke’s.”</p> <p>Hamlin smiled.</p>
<p>“Poor Chough! Some one told him he was like Richard Savage one day,
and that’s his pose. Would you like to come into the garden, Miss
Brown?”</p> <p>They went together into the strip of garden which lay
behind the house. There were not many flowers out as yet, only a few
peonies and lilacs, and a belated tulip or hyacinth, but there was
green, daisied grass, and big grey‐mossed apple‐trees still in
blossom; and across the low walls, covered with creepers, you saw big
waving tree‐branches, and old brick houses covered with ivy: the birds
were singing, and some hens clucking next door.  It was very quiet and
old‐world. Hamlin showed her all the rose‐buds which might soon come
out, and the place where the lilies would be, and the espaliers for
the sweet‐peas. Then<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7107-275"/> they went into
the two ground‐floor rooms which he was arranging for his studio:
there were quantities of beautiful rare books and volumes of prints,
and Persian and Japanese and old Italian metal‐work,and pottery all
about, and easels with unfinished pictures evcrywhere—a great and
beautiful confusion.</p> <p>When he had showed her his properties, and
she had reverently handled the things which had once belonged to
Shelley and Keats, and the bundles of unpublished manuscripts,
entrusted to Hamlin by living poets, they sat down in the studio and
began to discuss various matters: Anne’s school life, her readings and
lessons, Hamlin’s work, art, poetry, life, all sorts of things,—a long
and drowsy afternoon’s talk, such as is possible only after a long
correspondence between people become familiar without much personal
intercourse, who, knowing each other’s mind, are now beginning to know
each other’s face and ways and heart; and which has a charm quite
peculiar to itself, like that of hearing<pb n="281"
xml:id="VAB7107-276"/> for the first time, with full symphony of
voices and instruments, some piece of music which we have learned to
know and love merely from the dry score.</p> <p>Anne had never felt so
happy in all her life, and Hamlin not often happier in his, as they
sat in the studio, talking over abstract questions, which seemed to
acquire such a quite personal interest from those who were discussing
them.</p> <p>They were thus engaged when the servant announced Mr
Cosmo Chough.</p> <p>Anne’s heart sank at the thought of confronting
one of Hamlin’s most intimate friends, and one of the poets who
constituted the stars of his solar system.  To Anne’s surprise Mr
Chough did not at all resemble either Shelley or Keats, as she
imagined; he was a little wiry man, with fiercely brushed coal‐black
hair and whiskers, dressed within an inch of his life, but in a style
of fashionableness, booted and cravated, which was quite peculiar to
himself.</p> <pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7107-277"/> <p>“Miss Brown,” said
Hamlin, “let me introduce my old friend, Cosmo Chough.”</p> <p>Mr
Chough made a most fascinating bow, and swooped gracefully to the
other end of the studio to fetch himself a chair near Anne’s. He was
quite touchingly concerned in Anne’s journey and her sensations after
it; and asked her whether she liked London, with a sort of expansive
chivalry of manner, as of Sir Walter Raleigh spreading embroidered
cloaks across puddles for Queen Elizabeth, which struck her as rather
ridiculous, but very agreeable, as she had rather anticipated being
scorned by Hamlin’s poetical friends. Anne thought Mr. Chough
decidedly nice, with his oriental style of politeness, and magnificent
volubility, constantly quoting poetry in various languages in a shrill
and chirpy voice; moreover, he seemed to adore Hamlin, and this was
enough to put him in her good graces. Mr Chough rapidly informed her
what the principal poets in London and Paris (for he spoke of French
things with an affectation<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7107-278"/> of
throaty accent and allusions to his “real country” which greatly
puzzled Anne) were writing; and Anne felt so completely taken into
confidence that she ventured to ask him whether he was himself writing
anything at present, as she had greatly admired some short pieces of
his which Hamlin had sent her.</p> <p>Mr Chough was as modest as he
was polite. His eyes shone, and he clasped his small hands in ecstasy
at the idea of anything of his having pleased Miss Brown. He then
proceeded to tell her that he had an idea for a long poem—a sort of
masque or mystery‐play—to be called the Triumph of Womanhood.</p>
<p>“We were trying over some of Jomelli’s music a night or two ago, at
Isaac the great composer’s,” he explained; “magnificent music, which
no one can sing nowadays, and we feebly crowed, when in the midst of
the great burst of the “Gloria” I seemed to have revealed to me a
vision of a mystic procession of women going in triumph; I
understood,<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7107-279"/> in a sort of flash, the
mysterious and real regalness of Womanhood.”</p> <p>“It must have been
very beautiful,” said Anne, naively.</p> <p>Mr Chough had opened the
piano, and began playing, in a masterly way, a fragment of very
intricate fugue.</p> <p>“Do you notice that?” he asked: “that sudden
modulation there—ta ta ti, la la la—from A minor to E major,—that
somehow mysteriously brought home to me one of the figures of that
triumphal procession, and her I have tried to describe. If you like, I
can repeat you the first few lines; it is called ‘Imperia of
Rome.’”</p> <p>“How good of you,” cried Anne.</p> <p>“I think we had
better put off hearing it till you have composed rather more of the
poem,” interrupted Hamlin.</p> <p>Cosmo Chough looked mortified, and
Anne wondered why Hamlin should silence his old friend.</p> <p>“Tell
me all about Imperia of Rome,” she<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7107-280"/>
asked. “Who was she?—had she anything to do with the Scipios, or Cato,
or Tarquin?”</p> <p>“Imperia was not an ancient Roman,” explained
Chough; “she lived at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and it
is said that all the cardinals and poets and artists of Rome, nay, the
Pope himself, accompanied her coffin when she died.”</p> <p>“Why, what
had she done?—was she a saint?”</p> <p>“The inscription on her tomb
is, I think, the most truly noble and Roman ever composed on any
woman,” proceeded Chough; “Imperia . . .”</p> <p>“Miss Brown doesn’t
understand Latin, Cosmo,” interrupted Hamlin, roughly, “and I am sure
she would take no interest in Imperia or her epitaph.  Supposing you
let Miss Brown hear some of that beautiful Jomelli Mass you were
speaking about. Chough is one of the finest musicians I know,” he
explained to Anne, “and he is quite famous<pb n="286"
xml:id="VAB7107-281"/> for singing all sorts of forgotten old Italian
masters.”</p> <p>Chough sat down and began to sing, in a warbling
falsetto, but with the most marvellous old‐world grace and finish.</p>
<p>Anne did not attend. She was wondering about Imperia of Rome. Why
had Hamlin cut short Chough? What had Imperia done? The remarks of Mrs
Macgregor came to her mind; and she felt indignant, and her
indignation was all the greater, perhaps, because Chough’s offence was
vague and unknown—how nobly and simply Hamlin had silenced him! She
wondered whether he was very angry with Chough, and whether Chough’s
feelings had been much hurt. She felt rather sorry for the sharp way
in which he had been treated, and terrified lest she should be a
source of misunderstanding between Hamlin and his friends. She greatly
praised Chough’s singing.</p> <p>“Will you sing?” cried the little
poet, supplicatingly; “you must have a beautiful<pb n="287"
xml:id="VAB7107-282"/> voice. I know it from your way of
speaking.”</p> <p>Anne refused in terror.</p> <p>“Do sing, Miss
Brown,” urged Hamlin. So she took her courage with both hands, as she
expressed it, and sang an air by Scarlatti, Chough accompanying. She
made several false starts, and sang the wrong words almost throughout,
for she felt a lump in her chest. Anne had a deep, powerful, rather
guttural voice, not improved by singing modern German songs at
Coblenz; but the voice was fine, and she had caught something of the
manner of her former protectress, Miss Curzon, who had been a great
singer in her day.</p> <p>Chough burst out into applause.</p> <p>“A
splendid voice!” he cried; “you <emph>must</emph> sing, Miss Brown—you
<emph>must</emph> study—I will come and practise your accompaniments
for you, if you will permit me.”</p> <p>Anne looked at Hamlin; such an
offer, on so slight an acquaintance, surprised her.</p> <p>“You will
let Chough teach you, won’t you,<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7107-283"/>
Miss Brown?” asked Hamlin, approvingly. He afterwards told her that
Chough spent whatever leisure remained from an inferior Government
offce, in which, together with a whole band of other poets, he was
employed, in playing accompaniments for various young ladies whom he
considered, each singly, the most divine types of womanhood whom he
had ever met.</p> <p>Chough was in high spirits, and proceeded to
display to Anne two or three relics which he carried on his person. A
fervent though not very orthodox Catholic, he was prone to religious
mysticism: on his watch‐chain hung a gold cross, containing a bit of
wood from St Theresa’s house, which a friend had brought him from
Spain; by its side dangled a large locket, enclosing a wisp of yellow
hair.</p> <p>“It is a lock of Lucretia Borgia’s,” he said, displaying
it with as much unction as he had manifested for St Theresa—“a bit of
the one which Byron possessed,—the most precious thing I have in all
the world.”</p> <pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7107-284"/> <p>“She was rather
an insignificant character though, on the whole, wasn’t she?”
remarked Anne, not knowing what to say,—“a sort of characterless
villain, the Germans say.”</p> <p>Cosmo Chough was indignant.</p>
<p>“Insignificant!” he cried—“ a Borgia insignificant! Why, her blood
ran with evil as the Pactolus does with gold. All women that have ever
been, except Sappho and Vittoria Accoramboni, and perhaps Faustina,
were lifeless shadows by her side . . .”</p> <p>“I don’t believe in
those sort of women having been very remarkable,” said Anne, in her
frank, stolid way, “except for disreputableness.”</p> <p>“But that is
just it,—that which you call disreputableness, my dear Miss Brown,”
cried Chough, “therein is their greatness, in that fiery . . .”</p>
<p>Anne shook her head contemptuously.</p> <p>“I daresay great women
have often committed great crimes,” she said; “but then they have had
great plans and ambitions; they<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7107-285"/> have
not been mere wretched slaves of passion;” and she relapsed into
silence.</p> <p>She had had what Hamlin used to call her Amazon or
Valkyr expression as she spoke; and he felt, as he had felt in
Florence, the persuasion that this proud and sombre woman must have in
her future some great decision, some great sacrifice of others or of
herself.</p> <p>While they were talking, the servant entered to tell
Miss Brown that Mrs Argiropoulo was in the drawing‐room with Mrs
Macgregor.</p> <p>“Confound Mrs Argiropoulo!” exclaimed Hamlin between
his teeth, “to come intruding so soon.”</p> <p>“Is that the
lion‐hunting lady?” asked Anne.</p> <p>“Yes; I suppose you must
receive her, as she has called on you.”</p> <p>“Called on me?”
repeated Anne in amazement; “you mean on Mrs Macgregor. Why, how
should she have heard of me?”</p> <p>“All London has heard of you,
Miss Brown,” exclaimed Chough enthusiastically, as he opened the door
for her; “at least all that deserves<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7107-286"/>
to be called London. And Mrs Argiropoulo said last night at Wendell
the R.A.’s, that she was determined to see you before any other
creature in town. You see I have gained a march upon her.”</p> <p>Anne
did not answer, but she grew purple. So every one was curious to see
this nursery‐maid whom the great Hamlin had cast his eyes on, and whom
he had generously educated; for the first time her heart burst with
indignation and ruffled pride. But after a moment, as she sat in the
drawing‐room, after frigidly returning the fat and fashionable
lion‐huntress’s affectionate greeting, her conscience smote her: who
was she, that she should feel thus?  if she did depend entirely on
Hamlin’s generosity, ought she not to be grateful merely, and proud?
and if his friends felt curious to see her, was it not natural, he
being what he was; and had she a right to feel annoyed at their
curiosity, at their knowing all about her? It had been mean and
unworthy. Yet she could not help feeling a sort of vague anger<pb
n="292" xml:id="VAB7107-287"/> at she knew not what, as the lady
chattered away, in glib Greek‐English, about poets, and studios, and
dinner‐parties; and she answered Mrs Argiropoulo only in
monosyllables.</p> <p>“You must let me take your ward into society a
little, dear Mrs Macgregor,” lisped the Greek lady, “for I know you
hate going out of an evening. Miss Brown must meet some of the
principal persons of our set.”</p> <p>She was very fat, very
good‐natured, and extremely vulgar‐looking, her huge body encased in a
medieval dress of flaming gold brocade. “What in the world can she
have to do among artists and poets?” thought Anne.</p> <p>“Her husband
is in the currant‐trade,” whispered Chough—“an awful old noodle, but
he buys more pictures of our school than any one else. Their house is
a perfect wonder.”</p> <p>“My aunt is going to ask a few friends to
meet Miss Brown first here,” answered Hamlin; “perhaps you will join
them, Mrs Argiropoulo. There’s plenty of time to think of
party‐going.”</p> <pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7107-288"/> <p>“Very good,
very good,” answered Mrs Argiropoulo; “meanwhile perhaps I may have
the pleasure of taking Miss Brown out for a drive once or twice.”</p>
<p>“I am sure she will be delighted,” said Hamlin.</p> <p>“I hate that
woman!” exclaimed Hamlin, as he returned from escorting the wife of
the currant‐dealer to the door; “an odious, inquisitive, vulgar
brute.”</p> <p>“She looks good‐natured, I think,” insinuated Anne.</p>
<p>“Oh, every one’s good‐natured!”</p> <p>“In your set, Watty?” asked
Mrs Macgregor, bitterly.</p> <p>“Every one’s good‐natured!” continued
Hamlin, throwing himself back in his chair; “and so’s Mrs
Argiropoulo. But a kind of grain that sets my nerves off. That’s the
misfortune of London, that a lot of vulgar creatures, merely because
they buy our pictures and give dinners, have come and invaded our set,
showing us, like so many wild beasts, to<pb n="294"
xml:id="VAB7107-289"/> the fashionable world. Positively, I shall have
to give up London. But you will find,” he added, turning to Anne, “one
or two houses still remaining where one meets only superior people—the
houses where artistic life really goes on.”</p> <p>“Upon whipped cream
and Swiss champagne,” said Mrs Macgregor—“what one might call the
real, genuine, four hundred a‐year intellectual world. Ah, well,
Walter! you needn’t look reproachful; but it <emph>is</emph> droll
what sort of people you have come to associate with—clerks and
penny‐a‐liners, each of them a great poet.”</p> <p>Hamlin merely
smiled. “One must make a world for one’s self,” he said, and looked at
Anne.</p> <p>When Mr Cosmo Chough had taken his seat next to Mrs
Argiropoulo, the portly lady deluged him with questions and replies as
her landau rolled away.</p> <p>“On the whole, I’m quite as well
pleased not to take her out at once,” she said. “I’m<pb n="295"
xml:id="VAB7107-290"/> not at all so sure about her.  She seems to me
too big and lumpish and healthy‐looking. I should like to have one or
two opinions first—one or two artists’, and young Posthlethwaite’s,
and little O’Reilly’s—of course, they’ll see her at old Smith’s, or
Mrs Saunders’s, or some such house—and all depends on
<emph>their</emph> verdict.”</p> <p>“I know what <emph>mine</emph>
is,” cried little Chough, enthusiastically—“that she is the divinest
woman, in the cold, imperial style, with a latent and strange
smouldering passion, that I ever set eyes on. And as to that flabby
elephant Posthlethwaite, and that little hop, skip, and jump of an
impudent jackanapes O’Reilly, I wonder how you can think
<emph>their</emph> opinion worth having, or, indeed, their presence
supportable.”</p> <p>At this grand winding up Mrs Argiropoulo laughed
loudly.</p> <p>“I know you don’t like those young men,” she
said. “Posthlethwaite’s your rival, they say; he writes even more
improper things<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7107-291"/> than you do; and you
can’t forgive Thaddy O’Reilly calling your poems the loves of the
cannibals. Oh, I know you poets! Now, shall I drive you home? What’s
your address?”</p> <p>This was an old joke, for Mr Cosmo Chough always
surrounded his dwelling‐place with mystery, and had his letters
addressed to his office.</p> <p>“Pray don’t inconvenience yourself,”
he said in a stately way; “set me down at the corner of Park Lane. I
shall walk home in less than a minute from there.”</p> <p>“To the
corner of Park Lane,” ordered Mrs Argiropoulo of her footman, who
knew, as well as his mistress and every other creature in what they
called London, that Mr Cosmo Chough lived in a secluded terrace in
Canonbury.</p> </div> <pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7107-292"/> <div
type="chapter"> <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> <p><hi>ANNE BROWN</hi> found
that Hamlin, or, as he studiously put it, Mrs Macgregor, had made
several engagements for her before her arrival; and before she could
thoroughly realise that the school, the journey from Coblenz, were
things of the past, she found herself being led about, passively, half
unconsciously, through the mazes of æsthetic London. It was all very
hazy: Anne was informed that this and that person was coming to dinner
or lunch at Hammersmith; that this or that person hoped she would come
and dine or take tea somewhere or other; that such or such a lady was
going to take her to see some one or other’s studio, or to introduce
her at some other person’s house. She knew that they were all<pb
n="298" xml:id="VAB7107-293"/> either distinguished poets, or critics,
or painters, or musicians, or distinguished relations and friends of
the above; that they all received her as if they had heard of her from
their earliest infancy; that they pressed her to have tea, and
strawberries, and claret‐cup, and cakes, and asked her what she
thought of this picture or that poem; that they lived in grim,
smut‐engrained houses in Bloomsbury, or rose‐grown cottages at
Hampstead, with just the same sort of weird furniture, partly
Japanese, partly Queen Anne, partly medieval; with blue‐and‐white
china and embroidered chasubles stuck upon the walls if they were
rich, and twopenny screens and ninepenny pots if they were poor, but
with no further differences; and, finally, that they were all
intimately acquainted, and spoke of each other as being, or just
having missed being, the most brilliant or promising specimens of
whatever they happened to be.</p> <p>At first Anne felt very shy and
puzzled; but after a few days the very vagueness which<pb n="299"
xml:id="VAB7107-294"/> she felt about all these men and women, these
artists, critics, poets, and relatives, who were perpetually
reappearing as on a merry‐go‐round,—nay, the very cloudiness as to the
identity of these familiar faces—the very confusion as to whether they
were one, two, or three different individuals,—produced in Miss Brown
an indifference, an ease, almost a familiarity, like that which we may
experience towards the vague, unindividual company met on a steamer or
at a hotel.</p> <p>And little by little, out of this crowd of people
who seemed to look, and to dress, and to talk very much
alike,—venerable bearded men, who were the heads of great schools of
painting, or poetry, or criticism, or were the papas of great
offspring; elderly, quaintly dressed ladies, who were somebody’s wife,
or mother, or sister; youngish men, with manners at once exotically
courteous, and curiously free and easy, in velveteen coats and
mustard‐coloured shooting‐jackets or elegiac‐looking dress‐coats, all
rising in poetry, or art, or<pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7107-295"/>
criticism; young ladies, varying from sixteen to six‐and‐thirty, with
hair cut like medieval pages, or tousled like mœnads, or tucked away
under caps like eighteenth‐century housekeepers, habited in limp and
stayless garments, picturesque and economical, with Japanese chintzes
for brocade, and flannel instead of stamped velvets—most of which
young ladies appeared at one period, past, present, or future, to own
a connection with the Slade school, and all of whom, when not poets or
painters themselves, were the belongings of some such, or madly in
love with the great sonneteer such a one, or the great colourist such
another;—out of all this confusion there began gradually to detach
themselves and assume consistency in Anne’s mind one or two
personalities, some of whom attracted, and some of whom repelled her,
as we shall see further on; but to all these people, vague or
distinct, attractive or repulsive, Miss Brown felt a kind of
gratitude—something, in an infinitesimal degree, of the thankfulness
for undeserved kindness and courtesy which<pb n="301"
xml:id="VAB7107-296"/> constituted a large part of her love for
Hamlin.</p> <p>It was a curious state of things, thus to be introduced
by a man whom she knew at once so much and so little, to this
exclusive and esoteric sort of people; and whenever the thought would
come upon her how completely and utterly she, the daughter of the
dockyard workman of Spezia, the former servant of the little Perrys,
was foreign to all this, it made her feel alone and giddy, like one
standing on a rock and watching the waters below.</p> <p>Such was the
condition of things when one morning, about three weeks after Anne’s
arrival, Hamlin put upon the luncheon‐table a note addressed to Miss
Brown.</p> <p>“It’s an invitation to Mrs Argiropoulo’s big party on
the twenty‐seventh,” he said; “you must go, Miss Brown. She’s an awful
being herself; but you’ll see all the most interesting people in
London at her house. Edith Spencer or Miss Pringle can take you, if
Aunt Claudia feel too tired.”</p> <pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7107-297"/>
<p>“Aunt Claudia always feels too tired,” answered Mrs Macgregor, in a
bitter little tone. Anne could not quite understand this amiable and
cynical old lady, who was at once devotedly attached to her nephew,
and perpetually railing at his friends. A fear seized her lest, in her
vague, almost somnambulic introduction into æsthetic society, she
might have unconsciously neglected the woman who, proud of her birth
as she was, requested this workman’s daughter to address and consider
her as her aunt.</p> <p>“Oh, won’t you go?” cried Anne; “won’t you go,
Mrs Macgregor?”</p> <p>“The fact is,” hesitated Hamlin, “that—you
see—Mrs Argiropoulo invites comparatively few people, and—”</p>
<p>“That she wants only celebrities, or great folk, or pretty girls,”
interrupted Aunt Claudia, with her friendly cynicism, “or, as she
expresses it, that she wants no padding. So you must go with Mrs
Spencer or Miss Pringle, my dear.”</p> <pb n="303"
xml:id="VAB7107-298"/> <p>“But it is abominable; it is most rude of
Mrs Argiropoulo; and I certainly won’t go anywhere where Aunt Claudia
has not been invited.”</p> <p>“Nonsense, Nan,” silenced the old lady;
“you’re not up to this lion‐hunting world yet. Where there are so many
geniuses on the loose, and so many professed beauties, there are no
chairs for old women, except countesses or school board managers.”</p>
<p>“But since you think Mrs Argiropoulo hateful,” persisted Anne,
addressing Hamlin, “why should you wish me to go? You know I would
much rather not; and I think, considering her rudeness to your aunt,
you ought not to wish me to go.”</p> <p>“As you choose, Miss Brown,”
cried Hamlin, peevishly.</p> <p>“Don’t be absurd, Anne—you must go,”
insisted Mrs Macgregor. “Listen: Watty has actually been addling his
brains doing dressmaking; he has invented a dress for you to go to the
party, so you will break his heart if you refuse.”</p> <pb n="304"
xml:id="VAB7107-299"/> <p>Anne looked in amazement; and Hamlin
reddened.</p> <p>“I hope you will not deem it a liberty on my part,
Miss Brown,” he said; “but as I knew that this invitation was coming,
I ventured to make a sketch of the sort of dress which I think would
become you, and to give it to a woman who has made dresses from
artists’ directions; of course, if you don’t think it pretty, you
won’t dream of putting it on. But I could not resist the
temptation.”</p> <p>Miss Brown scarcely knew what to say or feel:
there was in her a moment’s humiliation at being so completely
Hamlin’s property as to warrant this; then she felt grateful and
ashamed of her ingratitude.</p> <p>“If you had shown me the sketch, I
daresay I could have made up the dress myself,” she said.</p> <p>“I
fear my sketch might not have been very intelligible to any one who
had not experience of making such things.”</p> <p>“Perhaps not,”
answered Anne, thinking of<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7107-300"/> all the
dresses for Miss Curzon and the little Perrys which she had made in
her day. “It was very good of you, Mr Hamlin.”</p> <p>“What an idiot I
was to let the cat out of the bag!” exclaimed Mrs Macgregor when her
nephew was out of hearing. “I’ve spoilt your pleasure in the frock;
and there’s Walter sulking because he thinks you won’t like it.”</p>
<p>“I am very ungrateful,” said Anne, sighing as she stooped over her
book, and feeling all the same that she wished Hamlin would let her
make up her dresses herself.</p> <p>A few days later the dressmaker
came to try on the dress, or rather (perhaps because Hamlin did not
wish Anne to see it before it was finished) its linings and a small
amount of the Greek stuff of which it was made; but it was not till
the very afternoon of Mrs Argiropoulo’s party that the costume was
brought home finished. Miss Brown was by this time tolerably
accustomed to the eccentric garb of æsthetic circles, and she firmly
believed that it was the only one which a self‐respecting<pb n="306"
xml:id="VAB7107-301"/> woman might wear; but when she saw the dress
which Hamlin had designed for her, she could not help shrinking back
in dismay. It was of that Cretan silk, not much thicker than muslin,
which is woven in minute wrinkles of palest yellowy white; it was
made, it seemed to her, more like a night‐gown than anything else,
shapeless and yet clinging with large and small folds, and creases
like those of damp sculptor’s drapery, or the garments of Mantegna’s
women.</p> <p>“I must get out a long petticoat,” said Anne,
appalled.</p> <p>“Oh please, ma’am, no,” cried the dressmaker. “On no
account an additional petticoat—it would ruin the whole effect. On the
contrary, you ought to remove one of those you have on, because like
this the dress can’t cling properly.”</p> <p>“I won’t have it cling,”
cried Miss Brown, resolutely. “I will let alone the extra petticoat,
but that’s as much as I will do.”</p> <p>“As you please, ma’am,”
answered the<pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7107-302"/> woman, and continued
adjusting the limp garment with the maid’s assistance.</p> <p>Anne
walked to the mirror. She was almost terrified at the figure which met
her. That colossal woman, with wrinkled drapery clinging to her in
half‐antique, half‐medieval guise,—that great solemn, theatrical
creature, could that be herself?</p> <p>“I think,” she said in
despair, “that there’s something very odd about it, Mrs Perkins. It
looks somehow all wrong. Are you sure that something hasn’t got
unstitched?”</p> <p>“No indeed, madam,” answered the dressmaker,
ruffled in her dignity. “I have exactly followed the design; and,” she
added, with crushing effect, “as it’s I who execute the most difficult
designs for the Lyceum, I think I may say that it could not be made
differently.”</p> <p>The Lyceum! Anne felt half petrified. What!
Hamlin was having her rigged out by a stage dressmaker!</p> <p>“Mr
Hamlin is down‐stairs, Miss Brown,”<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7107-303"/>
hesitated the maid, as Anne bade her help her out of this mass of limp
stuff. “He said he would wait to see you after the dressmaker had
left, if you had no objection.”</p> <p>“Watty wants to see you in your
new frock, my dear,” said Mrs Macgregor, putting her head in at the
door. “Come along.”</p> <p>Anne followed down‐stairs, gathering all
that uncanny white crape about her.  For the first time she felt a
dull anger against Hamlin.</p> <p>He met her in the dim
drawing‐room.</p> <p>“My hair isn’t done yet,” was all Miss Brown
could say, tousling it with her hands.</p> <p>“Leave it like that—oh,
do leave it like that!” exclaimed Hamlin; “you can’t think how”—and he
paused and looked at her, where she stood before him, stooping her
massive head sullenly—“you can’t think how beautiful you look,
Anne!”</p> <p>It was the first time he had called her by her Christian
name since that scene, long ago, in the studio at Florence.</p>
<p>“Forgive me, dear Miss Brown,” he apologised<pb n="309"
xml:id="VAB7107-304"/>. “I knew how such a dress must suit you, and
yet it has given me quite a shock to see you in it.”</p> <p>“It was
very kind of you to have it made for me,” said Anne, “and the stuff is
very pretty also; and—and I am so glad you like me in it.”</p>
<p>Hamlin kissed her hand. He was more than usually handsome, and
looked very happy.</p> <p>“Thank you,” he said; “I must now go home
and dress for that stupid dinner‐party. I will meet you at Mrs
Argiropoulo’s at half‐past ten or eleven. I suppose Edith Spencer will
call for you soon after dinner.  Good‐bye.”</p> <p>He looked at her
with a kind of fervour, and left the room.</p> <p>Anne sat down. Why
did that dress make such a difference to him? Why did he care so much
more for her because she had it on? Did he care for her only as a sort
of live picture? she thought bitterly. But, after all, it was quite
natural on his part to be pleased, since he had invented the
dress. And it was<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7107-305"/> very good of him
to have thought of her at all. And thus, in a state of enjoyable
repentance, she awaited the hour to go to Mrs Argiropoulo.</p> <p>Mrs
Spencer, a very lovable and laughable little woman, whose soul was
divided between her babies and fierce rancours against all enemies of
pre‐Raphaelitism, hereditary, in virtue of her father, Andrew
Saunders, in her family, came punctually, marvellously attired in grey
cashmere medieval garments, a garland of parsley and gilt oak‐leaves
in her handsome red hair.  On seeing Anne, who stood awaiting her by
the fireplace, she could not repress an exclamation of admiration.</p>
<p>“Yes,” answered Anne, unaccustomed to have her looks admired at
Florence and at Coblenz; “it is a very wonderful costume, isn’t it? Mr
Hamlin designed it for me. I think it was so kind of him; don’t
you?”</p> <p>“Kind? I see nothing kind about it. Walter” (she always
spoke of him thus familiarly, because he had worked as a youth in<pb
n="311" xml:id="VAB7107-306"/> her father’s studio) “is simply head
over ears in love with you, my dear.”</p> <p>Anne shook her head.</p>
<p>“Oh no,” she answered, with a sort of reasoned conviction, “he is
merely very good to me, that’s all—and perhaps he likes me also, of
course. But that’s all.”</p> <p>“You know nothing of the world, Annie;
and still less of Walter. He has never in his life been fond of any
one except when in love. I’ve not known him these fifteen years for
nothing.”</p> <p>“I think you are mistaken,” said Anne, quietly.</p>
<p>“I think you are not aware, my dear girl, that you are the most
beautiful woman Walter has ever seen.”</p> </div> </div>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                    <p><hi>MISS BROWN</hi> felt very excited as the brougham drew up at Mrs
                        Argiropoulo’s, and they entered her large house, blazing with lights and
                        crammed with flowers. She followed Mrs Spencer timidly up‐stairs; but the
                        men who crowded the landing never guessed that this majestic and
                        imperturbable creature could possibly be nervous. At the top of the stairs,
                        receiving her guests, an occupation (called seeing a few friends) which
                        excluded her from her own drawing‐room the best part of the evening, was Mrs
                        Argiropoulo, gorgeous in old lace and diamonds, and withal excessively
                        vulgar.</p>
                    <pb n="2" xml:id="VAB7108-003"/>
                    <p>“I am <emph>so</emph> glad to see you, dear Miss Brown,” she exclaimed to
                        Anne’s astonishment, despatching the other comers with a mere frigid
                        handshake. “I do think it is <emph>so</emph> good of you to come.”</p>
                    <p>“I wanted to come.”</p>
                    <p>“You are <emph>such</emph> a darling,” went on the fat Greek lady. “Come
                        along—I have kept seats for you and Mrs Spencer for the recitation. Dear old
                        Gosselin is going to recite for us—he is staying with us. I beg your
                        pardon”—this last remark was addressed to a compact crowd of ladies and
                        gentlemen on the threshold of the largest reception‐room, into which the
                        lady of the house summarily elbowed her way.</p>
                    <p>“Follow me,” she whispered, as Anne, bewildered among the lights and noise,
                        tried to pick her way over the trailing skirts, and every one turned to
                        stare as she passed—“Here, Euphrosyne”—perceiving one of her big bouncing
                        daughters in the crowd—“I want to introduce you to Miss Brown. Do<pb n="3" xml:id="VAB7108-004"/> keep that chair to the left for the Duchess of
                        Orkney—mind.”</p>
                    <p>The spacious drawing‐room was filled, as for a theatrical performance, with
                        rows of chairs, wellnigh occupied already. Into the very first of these Mrs
                        Argiropoulo led Anne and Mrs Spencer.</p>
                    <p>“Sit down,” she whispered. “I do hope you’ll enjoy yourself, Miss Brown.
                        You’ll hear Gosselin beautifully here. Oh dear, there’s the dear Marchioness
                        of Epsom; goodbye”—and she whirled off her portly person.</p>
                    <p>“Goodness!” whispered Mrs Spencer, “old Argey has actually put us into the
                        best places!”</p>
                    <p>Anne looked round. In front was a vacant space, with an open piano, and some
                        chairs in a corner facing the company. All round and behind were chairs, and
                        only a little gangway remained leading to the piano, next to where Mrs
                        Argiropoulo had placed Anne. She had never seen such a crowd of
                        magnificently and oddly dressed people in her life. Old ladies in velvet and
                            diamonds,<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7108-005"/> young ones in Worth toilets,
                        or weirdly attired in lank robes and draperies, with garlands of lilies or
                        turbans, or strings of sequins in their disorderly locks.</p>
                    <p>“I scarcely know any one here,” said Mrs Spencer, looking round like a rapid
                        little bird, “except one or two artists—there are three or four
                        R.A.’s—horrible creatures, to think the public is so wickedly infatuate as
                        to buy their pictures! Will Englishmen ever have any poetic feeling in art?
                        Papa would rather die than be an Academician. There’s little Thaddy
                        O’Reilly—horrid little jackanapes—in the door. That old flat‐faced man is
                        Lord Durrant, the critic. All the frumpy people with the diamonds must be
                        peeresses, I’m sure. There’s Cosmo Chough just come in,—they’re all looking
                        about for somebody or other. There’s Browning talking to old Argiropoulo.
                        Oh, here’s little Thaddy! How do you do, Mr O’Reilly?”</p>
                    <p>Mr O’Reilly, a callow critic who united æstheticism with frivolity, bowed,
                        and cast<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7108-006"/> curious glances at Anne. For a
                        moment she felt horribly ungrateful about the dress. She was sure that
                        little O’Reilly was thinking that it was a night‐gown.</p>
                    <p>“Who’s the lion to‐night?” asked Mrs Spencer.</p>
                    <p>Mr O’Reilly fixed his eyes on Anne, and answered languidly, with a faint
                        smile—</p>
                    <p>“Why, how can you ask, Mrs Spencer? Have we not all been invited expressly to
                        meet Monsieur Gosselin and his charming friends, the ladies from the French
                        comedy? No one comes to see lions or lionesses here, it is much too
                        intellectual for that.”</p>
                    <p>“Do tell me who <emph>is</emph> the lion of to‐night,” asked Mrs Spencer,
                        laughing.</p>
                    <p>“Haven’t I told you that there never <emph>are</emph> lions here? only an
                        occasional man of genius, shipped over fresh, between petroleum tins and
                        sewing‐machines, from America, may stray in in top‐boots and a red flannel
                        shirt—or it so happens that a beautiful woman is first noticed here—or
                        Victor Hugo walks in<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7108-007"/> quite casually to
                        tea—or the ghost of Byron mistakes this for Westminster Abbey. Oh, no lions,
                        never. Besides, here <emph>is</emph> Monsieur Gosselin, and here is
                        Mademoiselle Meringue and Madame Gauffre just come in. You see, Miss Brown,
                        how perfectly true it is that we are to meet them. They are taking their
                        place behind the piano. Yes, that is Madame Gauffre with the diamond
                        butterfly. You perceive how we are to have the pleasure of making their
                        acquaintance. Do you remark the vacant space round the piano? Miss
                        Euphrosyne Argiropoulo and her sister are alone privileged to enter it, and
                        the waiters also, to talk to Monsieur Gosselin and his fair comrades, and
                        offer them refreshments. It is what I call a moral <foreign xml:lang="fre">cordon sanitaire</foreign>, separating these <foreign xml:lang="fre">artistes</foreign> from the highly respectable company all round.”</p>
                    <p>“How horrible!” said Anne; “and do they pay them to be insulted like
                        that?”</p>
                    <p>“Pay them? oh, never. The Argiropoulos are far too delicate for that.
                            Monsieur<pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7108-008"/> Gosselin and mesdames of the
                        comedy are intimate friends of the house: they have been dining here, and
                        they are so kind as to recite a piece or two to Mrs Argiropoulo’s guests.
                        Let me see—what’s he going to recite—ah—‘Un Beignet.’ That will be
                        delicious.”</p>
                    <p>Gosselin had come forward, his opera‐hat in his hand, and begun to recite. It
                        was a very delightful performance, and Anne enjoyed it greatly. Besides, it
                        was a great relief to find that this entertainment was a performance, and
                        not as she had dreaded, a series of introductions and conversations with
                        celebrities. There was a dead silence during Gosselin’s recitation, except
                        near the door, where people kept pressing in and out. When he had ceased,
                        Anne looked round. She was surprised at the aspect of many of the company.
                        They had evidently not been listening at all, but looking about, straining
                        to see some one in the front rows. In a minute the little gangway leading to
                        the piano was crowded.</p>
                    <pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7108-009"/>
                    <p>Posthlethwaite, whom she had met several times before, was elbowing his
                        unwieldy person—a Japanese lily bobbing out of the button‐hole of his
                        ancestral dress‐coat—towards her. He had scarcely begun a description of a
                        picture which he had just seen, representing “Aphrodite tripping with pink
                        little feet across the dimpled sea sands,” when Mrs Argiropoulo came up with
                        several gentlemen about her, whom she began rapidly to introduce to Anne:
                        two of them were famous painters; one a well‐known sculptor; another was an
                        aristocratic drawing‐room novelist; the fifth a man of fashion. They all
                        stood in the gangway around Anne’s chair, while Posthlethwaite, who was not
                        the person to be ousted, propped his elephantine person against the end of
                        the piano, and leaning down his flabby flat‐cheeked face and mop of tow,
                        continued conversing with Miss Brown, regardless of the new‐comers, who
                        exchanged smiles as they listened to him with much more amused attention
                        than they had listened to<pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7108-010"/> Gosselin. Anne was
                        very bewildered; and as she answered the remarks of the party surrounding
                        her, she became aware that the people behind were all looking in her
                        direction—looking, doubtless, at Gosselin and his ladies behind the piano,
                        or at Posthlethwaite. For a moment Anne turned round, wondering whether she
                        should see Hamlin. But instead of Hamlin, her eyes met a face as familiar as
                        his—a dark, rather snub face, with bushy black beard and hair, which emerged
                        high above the heads of a knot of literary and political celebrities. She
                        started imperceptibly, but turned away, and looked towards the piano, where
                        Madame Gauffre had begun to recite, her plump little black figure standing
                        out against the moonlight flooding through the window, in strange contrast
                        to the yellow light of the room, in which dimly loomed the tops of trees and
                        the towers of Westminster. Could it be her cousin Dick? Anne rarely mistook
                        people’s faces, and least of all was it possible for her to mistake<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7108-011"/> Richard Brown’s, though she had not seen
                        him since that morning in Florence. But what should Richard be doing here,
                        in this fashionable party? It was evidently a mere accidental resemblance,
                        but it brought up a painful train of thought. Anne had once or twice written
                        to her cousin and guardian from school, in a formal cold way, and he had let
                        her know that he had become a partner in the military foundry, and had
                        changed his address. She had got a vague idea that he was now rich. But she
                        had not yet let him know of her arrival in England, and she felt ungrateful
                        and rather ashamed, for, after all, he had always wished her well, and had
                        been her playfellow. If he should have thought that she was ashamed of him?
                        Heaven knows that was not her feeling, but she felt against Richard Brown a
                        vague, instinctive aversion, as to something insulting and degrading to
                        herself. She determined, however, to write to him the very next day.</p>
                    <p>With a shrill exclamation and a pert curtsy,<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7108-012"/>
                        Madame Gauffre, who was reciting the part of a schoolgirl of fifteen,
                        suddenly came to an end.</p>
                    <p>“How do you do, Annie?” said a voice behind her.</p>
                    <p>She turned round. It was Richard Brown.</p>
                    <p>“I saw you as soon as I came in,” he said, calmly pushing aside the
                        astonished Posthlethwaite, “but I have only now been able to make my way
                        here. How do you like Madame Gauffre? don’t you think she’s delightful? or
                        rather, I ought to ask, how do you like London?”</p>
                    <p>The voice was always that same deep one, which, when lowered to a whisper,
                        had something curiously hot and passionate about it; but the accent and the
                        easy worldly manner seemed as if they could not belong to Richard Brown.</p>
                    <p>“Who the deuce is that fellow?” asked Posthlethwaite angrily of Mrs
                        Spencer.</p>
                    <p>“<emph>I</emph> don’t know—I’ve never seen him. Do you know, Mr O’Reilly, who
                        that big black man is, that has just come up to Miss Brown. Not one of
                            <emph>our</emph> set, that’s certain.”</p>
                    <pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7108-013"/>
                    <p>“Oh Lord, no!” answered the little journalist. “You don’t read newspapers in
                        your set, do you?”</p>
                    <p>“We always read the ‘Athenæum,’” answered Mrs Spencer, seriously.</p>
                    <p>“Newspapers are Cimmerian inventions,” said Posthlethwaite. “I’m a
                        republican, red, incarnadine, a <foreign xml:lang="fre">démocrate</foreign>
                        for Robespierre; but I never take up a paper, except to see which of my
                        friends have left town.”</p>
                    <p>Thaddy O’Reilly laughed. “Oh, well, you won’t find Education Brown in the
                        ‘Athenæum,’ Mrs Spencer—a mere barbarian, Goth, Philistine, but well known
                        in Philistia. He’s a tremendous Radical, goes in for disestablishment,
                        secular teaching; an awful fellow for obligatory education and paupers;
                        he’ll be in Parliament some day soon, for he’s backed by all the black
                        trade.”</p>
                    <p>“Surely it is very easy to feed paupers, as people used to, don’t you know,
                        in Chaucer?” said Mrs Spencer, simply and seriously.</p>
                    <pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7108-014"/>
                    <p>Young O’Reilly went into an inaudible but convulsive giggle.</p>
                    <p>“Anyhow, that’s Brown—‘Peace by Expensive Warfare Brown’ we call him. Look at
                        him; he’s a force in his world, as your father is in yours.”</p>
                    <p>“I wish he’d keep in his own coal‐cinders,” retorted Posthlethwaite. “What
                        business has he to talk to—”</p>
                    <p>“By Jove!” exclaimed O’Reilly, “it never struck me,—Anne Brown—Richard
                        Brown,—perhaps they’re relations!”</p>
                    <p>“What do you think of her?” whispered Mrs Argiropoulo to the little knot of
                        artists whom she had assembled.</p>
                    <p>Posthlethwaite, as usual, answered for the company.</p>
                    <p>“’Tis the body of a goddess; we must give it the soul of a woman.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s Hamlin’s look‐out,” answered Paints, the R.A.</p>
                    <p>“Why, what’s become of him?” they all asked. “Surely he was to be here.”</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7108-015"/>
                    <p>“Oh, be sure he’s lurking around here,” answered O’Reilly; “of course he
                        keeps in the background—enjoys his triumph from afar. You don’t sit in front
                        of your own picture on the first Academy day, do you, Paints?”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Posthlethwaite, will you take Miss Brown in to supper?” cried Mrs
                        Argiropoulo, who was working up and down the crowd.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown had already given Anne his arm.</p>
                    <p>“That can’t be,” cried Mrs Argiropoulo. “Mr Posthlethwaite <emph>must</emph>
                        take you in, dear. Dear Mr Brown, will you take in my daughter?”</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye, Annie,” whispered Richard Brown. “I will come and see you
                        to‐morrow.” And he let his cousin be borne away in triumph by
                        Posthlethwaite.</p>
                    <p>“Of course, Mr Posthlethwaite must take in Miss Brown,” explained Mrs
                        Argiropoulo to Mrs Spencer; “he’s the most conspicuous man, after all; and,
                        as it were, it stamps her at once. By the way, two R.A.’s, Paints and<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7108-016"/> Smeers, have already said that they would
                        like to paint her.”</p>
                    <p>“Walter Hamlin will never let her be painted by an R.A.,” answered Mrs
                        Spencer, fiercely; “and Annie has far too much artistic feeling to endure
                        such a thing. Why, Mr Bones has been drawing her for the last week, and papa
                        made a crayon of her.”</p>
                    <p>As Anne passed through the crowd on Posthlethwaite’s arm every one turned to
                        look at her. And then it suddenly flashed upon her that she was the person
                        people had been staring at, <emph>she</emph> was the lion of the
                        evening—she, the servant whom the great poet‐painter had adopted. Every one
                        was looking at her; she felt horribly alone, numb, unreal.</p>
                    <p>At that moment Hamlin came up.</p>
                    <p>“Have you amused yourself?” he asked. “Why, what’s the matter? do you feel
                        ill?”</p>
                    <p>“Only very tired. Oh, why didn’t you turn up before?” Anne’s voice was so
                        wretched and supplicating that Hamlin felt quite terrified.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7108-017"/>
                    <p>“Where’s Mrs Spencer?” he asked. “It must be that hot room. Edith, do take
                        Miss Brown home, she looks so awfully tired.”</p>
                    <p>“Permit me to take you down‐stairs,” said the mellifluous fat voice of
                        Posthlethwaite.</p>
                    <p>“I will take Miss Brown down myself, if you please, Posthlethwaite;” and
                        Hamlin pushed the prince of æsthetes roughly aside.</p>
                    <p>“Why did you not show yourself the whole evening?” asked Anne feebly, while
                        he was helping her on with her cloak.</p>
                    <p>“Why—because—I thought I had no right to monopolise you always,” answered
                        Hamlin in a whisper.</p>
                    <p>When the two women were alone in the brougham, Anne could stand it no longer;
                        and leaning her head in the corner, she began to cry.</p>
                    <p>“Why, what’s the matter, Annie?” cried Mrs Spencer, drawing her close to her.
                        “What’s the matter, my dear girl?”</p>
                    <p>“Nothing—nothing,” answered Anne, wiping her eyes. “I suppose it is because I
                        am so worn‐out—so—”</p>
                    <pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7108-018"/>
                    <p>“It’s that vile, ostentatious party,” replied the little woman, half in
                        consolation, half in pride—“mere stupid crushes—no real society, as
                            <emph>we</emph> have it. And I do think it <emph>is</emph> so disgusting
                        of Mrs Argiropoulo to make all the people stare at you as if you were a
                        burlesque actress. Oh, I know that set of lion‐hunting, purse‐proud,
                        would‐be artistic people. They would have your photograph in all the
                        shop‐windows at once, and Royal Highnesses to meet you. Papa and I always
                        wonder that Walter hasn’t cut all those horrid sycophants before. You know
                        that it’s only artists and poets of our school who will ever appreciate you
                        really, although the others would hawk you about as a sort of professional
                        beauty.”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> sudden discovery that she was the standard beauty of the most
                        prominent artistic set, and accepted as such by the rest of society, would
                        have greatly disturbed almost any woman. But Anne Brown’s nature was too
                        completely homogeneous—too completely without the innumerable strata, and
                        abysses, and peaks, and winding ways of modern women’s characters—for her to
                        experience any of the mixed feelings of pride, and disgust, and humiliation,
                        and general uncomfortablehess which would have been the lot of a more
                        complex nature. The atoms of her character were not easily shaken into new
                        patterns: it was coherent, and, like most coherent things, difficult to
                        upset, slow to move, and quick to settle down.</p>
                    <pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7108-020"/>
                    <p>After the first shock of surprise, she resigned herself, without doubts, or
                        diffidence, or elation, to her new place. That she was more beautiful than
                        other women had indeed never occurred to her before; but once that it had
                        been proved to her she accepted it as a fact, as she had accepted as a fact
                        the still stranger news that Hamlin had singled her out to change her life
                        and love her. She did not take it at all as a merit or any other exciting
                        thing in herself: the only effect which it had upon her was to strengthen a
                        curious feeling, constitutional in her, and resulting probably from the very
                        coherence and weightiness of her character, that she was fated to be or do
                        something different from other women—a sort of sense of tragic passiveness,
                        which always formed the background of her happiness. Moreover, the discovery
                        which she had made at Mrs Argiropoulo’s somehow made Anne’s position more
                        intelligible and simple to herself. She had heard of other men who had
                        educated and married girls of the lower orders on account<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7108-021"/> of their beauty. Hamlin’s behaviour was now no
                        longer a mystery to her; and the absence of mystery served merely, to Anne’s
                        quite unromantic, practically passionate, half‐southern temper, to make
                        Hamlin’s nobleness and goodness more obvious to her. She had the curious
                        Italian capacity for feeling an ideal passion—a passion which was merely a
                        sublimated form of friendship and admiration—for a real personality; and her
                        instinctive desire was merely to get nearer that real personality. But much
                        as she tried, the reality of Hamlin seemed to escape and baffle her: he was
                        a complex man, and she a homogeneous woman; and as she could not see Hamlin
                        well in detail, she loved him in the very simple and broad outlines which
                        she was able to comprehend.</p>
                    <p>Now that she had settled down in æsthetic society, and found her place, and
                        got to understand the main points of things, she was quite ideally happy.
                        Her life was very full, and was surrounded by a flood of love,—on her side
                        or on Hamlin’s? She scarcely knew; but she<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7108-022"/>
                        knew that she was happy. By this time the round of sight‐seeing, play‐going,
                        excursions, and introductions, was over; her life had subsided into the
                        normal. Its object, she felt, as one feels a wholesome and agreeable desire
                        for food or sleep, was to make herself as worthy as possible of Hamlin, or
                        rather to let him find in her the best possible bargain. She worked very
                        hard at all the things which the school had left incomplete,—at what, living
                        in that æsthetic society, seemed to her the solid requisites of life. She
                        read history and biography and poetry, with the determination with which
                        other girls, anticipating marriage, might study manuals of domestic economy;
                        and she worked at developing her taste in art and music as others might have
                        practised cooking or dressmaking; for these were the things which would be
                        requisite in Hamlin’s spiritual household. The people around her, the men
                        and women of Hamlin’s set, seemed to her as necessary, as inevitable, as
                        normal as the trees and houses all round. Some of them<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7108-023"/> she liked, and some she disliked; but their
                        ideas, though sometimes absurd caricatures, and their tempers, though often
                        intolerable, seemed to Anne quite natural and proper in the main, though
                        rendered ridiculous or disagreeable in individuals. Indeed she got rather to
                        believe in imperfect individuals,—being thus constantly either made cross by
                        the touchiness, the morbidness, the disgusting fleshliness, the intolerance
                        of the æsthetes around her, or made to laugh by their affectations, their
                        vanity, their inconsistency, their grotesque manias of wickedness and
                        mysticism—while unable to judge or condemn the general, intellectual, and
                        moral condition of which these individual excrescences were the result.</p>
                    <p>Some of the people were distinctly repulsive, or distinctly boring, or
                        distinctly annoying to her; others, like Mrs Spencer and her father and
                        mother and sisters, decidedly lovable; others, like little Chough, decidedly
                        amusing and amiable: and she took them as they came, but with the
                        indifference of concentrated<pb n="23" xml:id="VAB7108-024"/> feeling; for what did it matter whether she cared for them, or
                        they cared for her, as long as she was doing her best to deserve Hamlin?</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Anne Brown read quantities of medieval and Elizabethan literature;
                        went with Hamlin to see pictures and hear music; studied Dante and
                        Shakespeare—the algebra and arithmetic, so to speak, of the æsthetic set—and
                        even began, secretly, to work at a Greek grammar. Twice a‐week Cosmo Chough
                        came to practise her accompaniments with her; and twice a‐week also, of an
                        evening, friends dropped in at the house at Hammersmith, when Mrs Macgregor
                        would leave her nephew and niece, as she called her, to entertain the
                        guests. On other evenings Anne would usually go to the house of one of the
                        set, where literature and art, and the faults of friends, and the
                        wrong‐headedness of the public, were largely discussed; music was made,
                        young long‐haired Germans on the loose performing; and poets, especially
                            the<pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7108-025"/> inexhaustible Chough, would recite
                        their compositions, perched on the arms of sofas, or stretched on the
                        hearth‐rug; while the ladies went to sleep, or pretended to do so, over the
                        descriptions of the kisses of cruel, blossom‐mouthed women, who sucked out
                        their lovers’ hearts, bit their lips, and strewed their apartments with
                        coral‐like drops of blood. Most of these poets, as Anne speedily discovered,
                        were young men of harmless lives, and altogether unacquainted with the
                        beautiful, baleful ladies they represented as sucking at their vitals; and
                        none was more utterly harmless than Cosmo Chough. Instead of the terrible
                        Faustinas, Messalinas, and Lucretia Borgias to whom his poems were
                        addressed, the poor little man had in his miserable home in the north of
                        London a wife older than himself, often bedridden and always half crazy, who
                        turned the house in a sort of disorderly litter, neglected her children, and
                        vented on her husband the most jealous and perverse temper; but the victim
                        of Venus, as he styled himself,<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7108-026"/> nursed her
                        with absolute devotion, denied himself every gratification to allow her a
                        servant and send his children to school, and made all new‐comers believe
                        that Mrs Cosmo Chough was the most angelic invalid that the world had ever
                        seen. People in the set had got accustomed to this fact, and treated Chough
                        merely as an amusing little caricature of genius; but when Anne understood
                        the real state of the case, she was deeply touched, and possessed with a
                        violent desire to help the little man. He could not, indeed, restrain his
                        habit of alluding in pompous language to Phryne, Pasiphaë, La Belle
                        Heaulmière, Madame du Barry, and all the most celebrated improprieties of
                        all times and nations; nor from discussing the most striking literary
                        obscenities, from Petronius to Walt Whitman. But although at first surprised
                        (as every one was surprised and indeed shocked) by Anne’s unblushing and
                        quietly resolute—“I think you had better leave that subject alone, Mr
                        Chough”—he became quite devoted to Anne.<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7108-027"/>
                        When he gave a set of lectures, in Mrs Spencer’s house, on what was
                        nominally Elizabethan drama, but virtually the unmentionable play of Ford,
                        and the ladies dropped off one by one and merely laughed at poor Cosmo’s
                        eccentricities, Anne had the courage to sit out the performance, and to tell
                        Chough openly that he ought to be ashamed of himself for holding forth on
                        such subjects—a proceeding which made Hamlin’s friends blame Miss Brown for
                        want of womanly feeling and prudishness alike; and which put Hamlin just a
                        little out of temper, until she answered his unspoken censure by remarking,
                        with a sort of Italian bluntness and seriousness, that a woman of her age
                        had no business not to understand the real meaning of such things, and
                        understanding them, not to let the poets know that she would not tolerate
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“You see, it enters into their artistic effects,” explained Mrs Spencer. “I
                        don’t like such things personally, but of course everything is legitimate in
                        art.”</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7108-028"/>
                    <p>“They may be legitimate in art,” answered Anne, sceptically, “but they shan’t
                        be legitimate in my presence.”</p>
                    <p>To return to Chough. Anne gradually became the confidant of the domestic
                        difficulties, though not of the domestic shame, of the little poet; and to
                        every one’s great astonishment, she obtained Hamlin’s permission to have one
                        of Chough’s little girls at Hammersmith every Saturday till Monday, and
                        tried to instil into the miserable puny imps some notion of how to behave
                        and how to amuse themselves.</p>
                    <p>“You are not going to take that child out in the carriage with you, surely?”
                        asked Hamlin, the first Sunday that Maggy Chough spent at Hammersmith.</p>
                    <p>“Of course I am,” answered Anne. “She’s the daughter of your most intimate
                        friend; surely you can’t grudge the poor little thing some amusement. And I
                        want you to go with us to the Zoo, Mr Hamlin. I’m sure it’s much more
                        fascinating than the Grosvenor or the Elgin rooms.”</p>
                    <pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7108-029"/>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled; and next day made a crayon drawing of Anne, one of the dozens
                        in his studio, with Chough’s child; but he managed to make Anne look
                        mournfully mysterious, and the child haggard and wild, so that people
                        thought it represented Medea and one of the children of Jason.</p>
                    <p>So far Anne’s acquaintance were entirely limited to the æsthetic set; but
                        there were two exceptions. One was a couple of sisters, Mary and Marjory
                        Leigh, who existed as it were on the borderland—Mary Leigh being a sort of
                        amateur painter with strong literary proclivities; the other was Richard
                        Brown, who, after the meeting at Mrs Argiropoulo’s, called at Hammersmith,
                        was politely received by Hamlin, with whom he appeared quite reconciled, and
                        talked on a variety of indifferent subjects, as if Anne Brown had never been
                        his ward. Hamlin had apparently never appeared to him in the light of a
                        slave‐buyer and seducer, and all parties had apparently never been in any
                        save their present position. Anne<pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7108-030"/> asked her
                        cousin to one or two of their evenings: he came, seemed to know one or two
                        people slightly, and although professing profound ignorance of art, managed
                        to interest one or two of the æsthetic brotherhood by developing his views
                        on the necessity of extending artistic training to the lower classes.</p>
                    <p>“He isn’t at all a stupid man, that cousin of yours,” remarked little Mrs
                        Spencer; “and I do think he is <emph>so</emph> right in wishing to give poor
                        people a taste of beauty.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure <emph>we</emph> are most of us poor people, and don’t always get a
                        taste of anything else, Edith,” cried her father, the veteran painter in
                        tempera, who was a fearful punster.</p>
                    <p>“Oh papa, you know what I mean; and I’m sure art will gain ever so much. It’s
                        only what Mr Ruskin has said over and over again, and Mr Morris is always
                        talking about.”</p>
                    <p>“Any one is free to give the lower classes that taste of beauty, as long as
                            <emph>I</emph> am not required to see or speak to the noble workmen,”
                        said Hamlin. “I hate all that democratic bosh.”</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7108-031"/>
                    <p>“Oh, I know, Watty; your ancestors kept negroes, and you would like to have
                        negroes yourself,” said Mrs Spencer, hotly.</p>
                    <p>“Heaven forbid! I only ask to be left alone, my dear Edith, especially by
                        reformers.”</p>
                    <p>At any rate, Richard Brown was permitted to show himself sometimes in
                        æsthetic company. But Richard Brown did not avail himself much of the
                        condescending permission to improve his mind; and neither at her own house
                        (for people always spoke of Miss Brown’s house now) nor at the houses of any
                        of her friends would Anne have had much opportunity of seeing her cousin,
                        had he not, by a curious chance, been a frequent visitor at the house of the
                        Leigh girls.</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh was, as already said, a demi‐semi‐æsthete; she had studied art in
                        an irregular, Irish sort of way, and she had a literary, romantic kind of
                        imagination, which fitted her rather for an illustrator than a painter. She
                        felt the incompleteness of her own endowment, in a gentle, half‐humorous,<pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7108-032"/> half‐sad way; and the incompleteness of
                        her own life—for her ideal of happiness was to travel about, to live in
                        Italy, and this she had cheerfully sacrificed to please her sister, whose
                        only interests in life were school boards, and depauperisation, and (it must
                        be admitted) a mild amount of flirtation with young men of scientific and
                        humanitarian tendencies. Between the sisters there was perfect love, but not
                        perfect understanding; and Mary Leigh, who felt a little lonely, a little
                        shut into herself by her younger sister, who was at once a philosopher and a
                        baby in her eyes, vented her imaginative and artistic cravings in a
                        passionate admiration for Hamlin’s strange and beautiful ward or <foreign xml:lang="fre">fiancée</foreign>, a kind of intellectual fervour which
                        Anne was as remarkable for inspiring as she seemed unable to inspire either
                        ordinary liking or ordinary love: and as Mary Leigh likewise adored Hamlin,
                        and Hamlin in return thought Mary Leigh a nice sort of girl, Anne Brown did
                        what visiting and sight‐seeing and shopping was left to her<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7108-033"/> almost always in Mary Leigh’s company. Now, if
                        Anne was the idol of the æsthetic Mary, the humanitarian and practical
                        younger sister, who, with the cut‐and‐dry decision of a philosopher of
                        twenty‐two, looked upon æsthetics and æsthetes as somewhat pestilent in
                        nature, had her idol also in a very different person, and this was no other
                        than Richard Brown, to be whose lieutenant in some of his philanthropical
                        and educational schemes was Marjory’s highest ambition. Richard Brown had,
                        ever since meeting his cousin at Mrs Argiropoulo’s in the character of an
                        artistic beauty, made up his mind that Anne was no concern of his, and was
                        luckily disposed of in the æsthetic set; and for some time he almost took a
                        pleasure in making her understand, whenever he met her at the Leighs’ house
                        in Chelsea, that he did not in the least expect <emph>her</emph> to take an
                        interest, or pretend to take an interest, in the plans which he discussed
                        with Marjory Leigh. Anne on the other hand, imbued with Hamlin’s and<pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7108-034"/> Chough’s theory that all attempts at
                        improving the world result merely in failure, and that the only wise
                        occupation of a noble mind is to make for itself a paradise of beautiful
                        thoughts and forms and emotions, was extremely sceptical of her cousin’s and
                        Marjory’s schemes, and once or twice declared her disbelief with perfect
                        openness.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown was at first annoyed, then amused, then indignant; and then,
                        seeing how completely Anne’s ideas were borrowed from her set, and also how
                        completely unsuitable they were to her downright, serious, and practical
                        nature, he determined, not without vanity playing a part as well as
                        conviction, to “let a little light,” as he expressed it, into her mind.</p>
                    <p>There had been recently founded, by some friends of his, a kind of club where
                        girls of the dressmaker’s apprentice and shopwomen class might spend their
                        leisure moments in reading and meeting each other; which club, besides a
                        library and reading‐room, offered<pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7108-035"/> to its
                        members a certain number of classes or sets of lectures on various subjects,
                        delivered at a nominal price, after work hours.</p>
                    <p>The lecturers or teachers were nearly all young ladies: Marjory Leigh had for
                        some time lectured on sanitary arrangements (this being her especial hobby),
                        and Mary Leigh was going to set up a drawing‐class.</p>
                    <p>Anne Brown, practical by nature and æsthetically sceptical by training, had
                        no very great belief in the famous club; she had been told so often that
                        mankind is too stupid and degraded to be helped, that she had almost got to
                        believe it. But she let herself be taken one evening to a lecture, at what
                        she called Marjory’s college. The lecture was just beginning as they entered
                        the little, white‐washed, bare room up innumerable stairs. Four or five
                        young women, decently dressed, were seated at desks, copy‐books and
                        ink‐stands before them; and a beautiful little girl, who had been pointed
                        out to Anne in æsthetic circles as a rising poetess, was seated opposite<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7108-036"/> them at the end of a table. The Leighs and
                        Anne sat down silently near the door, and the lecture began. It was on
                        modern history. The pupils listened with the greatest attention, their pens
                        flying on their copy‐books. The lecturer, a small, graceful, extremely frail
                        little creature, began in a somewhat tremulous voice; then gradually, as she
                        got more excited, became more voluble, excited, and absolutely eloquent.</p>
                    <p>“She is too delicate for such work,” whispered Marjory, “but she will do
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne listened. But she did not follow the lecturer’s argument very closely.
                        She thought what these girls were, what the drudgery of their work, the
                        temptations of their leisure, the hopeless narrowness of their horizon; and
                        she thought also, the thought throbbing on almost like dull pain, what it
                        would have been for her, when she also was alone in the world—when she had
                        drudgery on the one hand and temptation on the other—when her whole nature
                        had been parched and withered for want of a few words that should speak
                            of<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7108-037"/> higher and nobler things,—had she
                        been permitted, once a‐week, to come to such a place, to hear about such
                        subjects, to be spoken to by such an earnest and enthusiastic and exquisite
                        creature as this. At the end of the lecture the girls crowded shyly round
                        the lecturer, some to beg her to explain a point, others to ask for books on
                        the subject, all of them to thank with pathetic earnestness. Then they went
                        away, and the Leigh girls came forward to the lecturer. From where she sat
                        she could not see the new‐comers; and she was astonished, and in a way
                        awe‐stricken, on seeing Anne Brown, the exotic beauty of whom she had heard
                        so much, whose portrait she had seen in so many studios, and to whom she had
                        been introduced almost in fear and trembling, for Anne had a kind of
                        awe‐inspiring fascination for imaginative people. Anne, on the other hand,
                        was silent and depressed, and the little poetess must have made up her mind
                        that this magnificent and sombre creature was as sullen and lethargic and
                        haughty as one of<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7108-038"/> Michelangelo’s goddesses.
                        But in reality Miss Brown could have laid her head on one of the desks and
                        cried like a child.</p>
                    <p>When, the following day, Mary Leigh came to take her out for a walk, Anne
                        looked as if she had received bad news, or as if she had bad news to
                        communicate. She answered only in monosyllables; until, as they were looking
                        in at a shop window, she suddenly turned to her companion.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think,” she said hesitatingly, “that I might perhaps—teach something
                        at Marjory’s college?”</p>
                    <p>“Teach!” exclaimed Mary Leigh in astonishment; “you teach! Why, what would
                        you teach, Anne dear?”</p>
                    <p>Anne was silent. She sighed. “That’s just what I have been thinking all the
                        morning—I fear—but you see I <emph>do</emph> so want to teach something. You
                        see, that little poet‐girl gives up her time to it, and she was born a lady,
                        and doesn’t know—can’t know—all the good she is doing. While I—”</p>
                    <pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7108-039"/>
                    <p>Mary Leigh squeezed her hand.</p>
                    <p>“We will ask your cousin,” she said.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, not Dick—don’t mention it to Dick,” answered Anne; “he is sure to
                        make difficulties and laugh at me—he thinks me a useless thing.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>You</emph> a useless thing!” replied the enthusiastic Irish girl
                        looking at her companion. “Why, then—then all the Titians in the gallery,
                        and the Elgin marbles, and all Keats, and all Shelley, and Beethoven, and
                        Mozart, must be useless also.”</p>
                    <p>Anne sighed. “All those things didn’t make themselves,” she answered. “It’s
                        the artists who were useful and whom we have to thank.”</p>
                    <p>The other Miss Leigh was immensely astonished, and, with her youthful
                        intolerance, rather indignant at Anne’s suggestion.</p>
                    <p>“I think,” said Anne, hesitatingly, “that I could, with a little work, manage
                        medieval literature—at least medieval lyrics.”</p>
                    <p>Marjory shook her head. “There’s too much of that sort of thing already,”
                            she<pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7108-040"/> said. “Every one wants to teach
                        literature. Where’s the use of telling them about a parcel of Provençal and
                        old French and German and Italian people, when they don’t yet know the
                        difference between Voltaire and Molière, and Goethe and Frau von
                        Hillern?”</p>
                    <p>“That’s true,” Anne said sadly.</p>
                    <p>Marjory was rather sorry for her rough practicalness, but at the same time
                        she had a blind impulse to harass an æsthete.</p>
                    <p>“Political economy is what we want most,” she said; and, as the door opened
                        and Richard Brown entered, she went on—</p>
                    <p>“Isn’t it true that political economy is what we want most at the college, Mr
                        Brown?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” answered Richard. “How are you, Miss Leigh?—how are you, Annie? What
                        about it?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, only that your cousin wants to teach at the college, and I tell her that
                        literature is no use, and that political economy is what we want.”</p>
                    <p>“You want to teach, Annie?” cried Brown,<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7108-041"/> and
                        his face assumed that look of somewhat brutal contempt hidden under suavity
                        of manner, which Anne hated so much. “You want to teach? How dull æsthetic
                        society must be getting, to be sure!”</p>
                    <p>“I am not dull, Dick,” answered Anne, sternly; “but it struck me that, having
                        been a poor girl without education myself—until” (and she looked her cousin
                        reproachfully in the face) “Mr Hamlin had me taught—I have an obligation to
                        help other girls like what I was, greater than the obligation of people who
                        have always been educated. I daresay there may be nothing that I
                            <emph>can</emph> teach; but there is no reason to laugh at me.”</p>
                    <p>“Laugh at you!” cried Brown. “Oh, not in the least! I was only smiling at the
                        cool way in which you absolve those who are born in fortunate circumstances
                        from the obligation which you yourself feel.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think that’s quite true, Dick,” answered Anne, simply. “You think
                        it’s absurd on my part, and I knew you would,<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7108-042"/> because you think me frivolous and artistic.”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said Brown, evidently surprised at her manner, and looking
                        searchingly in her pale, strange‐featured face, “what do you think you might
                        teach?”—his voice was much gentler.</p>
                    <p>“At present”—Anne’s voice sank, for she felt the uselessness of her offer—“I
                        can think only of medieval literature” (Brown smiled); “but perhaps, if
                        there were something else, I might get it up.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure there won’t be a vacancy for anything except political economy,”
                        interrupted Marjory Leigh, impatiently. “I’m quite positive, from what the
                        secretary told me, all the rest is glutted.”</p>
                    <p>“I fear it is the case,” mused Brown. “There has been a talk of teaching
                        singing,—in which case, perhaps—”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t sing well enough,” said Anne, haughtily. Why was she always having
                        her æstheticism thrust in her face?</p>
                    <pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7108-043"/>
                    <p>“Besides,” added her cousin, “it’s extremely improbable.”</p>
                    <p>They fell to talking of other things. As Brown was leaving, Anne stopped
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“Tell me,” she said, “what are the best books to begin learning political
                        economy?”</p>
                    <p>Brown smiled. “Why? Do you want to teach it?”</p>
                    <p>“Since it is such an important thing,” answered Anne, gravely, “I think I
                        should like to learn it.”</p>
                    <p>“It’s not amusing, Annie.”</p>
                    <p>“It can’t be duller than Minnesingers—and nothing is dull when one is
                        learning it. Can’t you tell me of some books?”</p>
                    <p>Brown looked at her with a puzzled expression. “I have written a primer of it
                        myself,” he said—“I will send it you; and if you get through that, you will
                        find at the end a list of text‐books, some of which I can lend you to take
                        into—”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you, Dick. I shall be much obliged to you.”</p>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7108-044"/>
                    <p>“You shall have it this evening. Goodbye, Annie, and <foreign xml:lang="ita">felici studj</foreign>, as you Italians say.” He laughed, and went
                        away.</p>
                    <p>“You’ll find it tough work,” remarked Marjory, shaking her short mane of hair
                        out before the glass; “but, of course, a primer is never <emph>very</emph>
                        difficult.”</p>

                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> Mrs Macgregor had gone up‐stairs to rest before dinner on their
                        arrival at Wotton Hall, Hamlin took Miss Brown round the huge,
                        deserted‐looking house, which his grandfather had built on returning from
                        Jamaica. It was like an Italian villa, with vaulted rooms, gilded and
                        stuccoed, marble floors, and terraced windows; the furniture was all of the
                        Napoleonic period; nothing could be more dignified or sadder.</p>
                    <p>When Hamlin had shown her the large drawing‐rooms, the library, the room
                        which had been the play‐room when he was a child, he took Anne into the
                        large Palladian hall, and showed her the innumerable portraits of ladies and
                        gentlemen in armour, and ruffs,<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7108-047"/> and
                        bobwigs, and powder, hanging all round—his ancestors ever since his family
                        had left England in the civil wars.</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at them shyly. They were mostly indifferently painted and
                        vapid—affected, like all old portraits by mediocre painters; but it seemed
                        to her that in most of these gentlemen, with peaked beards on their Vandyck
                        lace, or horse‐hair wigs, or carefully powdered hair tied back in silk bags,
                        she could recognise a resemblance to the man by her side—the same delicate,
                        handsome features, the same fair, almost beardless complexion, the same
                        gentle, melancholy, slightly ironical expression: and never did the real
                        meaning of Hamlin’s marriage with her come clearer before her mind than
                        when, in that silent hall, surrounded by all those portraits of his
                        ancestors, she suddenly saw herself and him reflected in one of the long dim
                        mirrors; she, so tall and strong, so powerful of bone and muscle, with her
                        strange, half‐southern, half‐Jewish, and<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7108-048"/>
                        almost half‐Ethiopian beauty, by the side of that slight, fair, pale,
                        aristocratic man, with features sharp like those of a high‐bred race‐horse,
                        nervous and wistful and dreamy, as if he were tired of his family having
                        lasted so long.</p>
                    <p>“They all married and intermarried for nearly a century,” said Hamlin,
                        “that’s why they’re all so like each other. I often wonder why it didn’t end
                        in insanity—you see it has ended in a poet at last. My mother was the first
                        woman married by a Hamlin for eighty years who was not at least a second
                        cousin,—in those islands there were very few decent people, you see. Don’t
                        they all look dapper and respectable? It appears they were not. That man in
                        the corselet was killed in a duel about another man’s wife. That one in the
                        middle, the boy in the grey dress with the powdered hair, Sir Thomas Hamlin,
                        they used to call the bad Sir Thomas, because he amused himself practising
                        pistol‐shooting on black people, whom he had put all round his yard;<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7108-049"/> he was a very fine gentleman, they say,
                        and would go out only in the evening on account of his complexion. The one
                        who looks like a woman, with the open shirt‐collar and the long hair, was my
                        great‐uncle, Mordaunt Hamlin, who supposed himself to be a poet, somewhere
                        in the first years of this century; he was an opium‐eater, and did some
                        horribly disgraceful things, I don’t exactly know what, and was poisoned,
                        they say, by some low woman, because she was tired of him. My father had his
                        portrait removed; but I used to see it in the lumber‐room when I was a
                        child, and thought him very handsome and eery; and when I came of age, I had
                        it brought down, because I think he’s far better‐looking and more
                        interesting than any of the respectable ones. Then he was a poet also, you
                        see, and Cosmo Chough pretends I’m like him. Do you think so, Miss
                        Brown?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” said Anne, laughing, as she looked at Hamlin, at that noble and
                        delicate face, which seemed to her the noblest and most beautiful<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7108-050"/> in the world; and yet, when she looked at
                        Mordaunt Hamlin again, with his morbid woman’s face and his effeminate bare
                        throat, she could not help feeling a certain disgust at the thought that
                        perhaps—perhaps— Hamlin <emph>was</emph> just a little like him.</p>
                    <p>“That’s my mother,” said Hamlin, pointing to a faded crayon of a beautiful,
                        gentle, pathetic‐looking woman.</p>
                    <p>“<emph>That</emph> is like you,” cried Anne, delighted. “That is very like
                        you—like your expression. I was wondering where you got your expression from
                        among all your Jamaica ancestors.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m glad you think so. She was a very beautiful woman, and very brave and
                        noble, and not very happy, poor mamma.”</p>
                    <p>“Did you know her?”</p>
                    <p>“Only till I was about twelve; she died young. That is grandpapa; and that is
                        my uncle Arnold,—he died young too—in fact, drank himself to death. Don’t
                        you think he is like Mordaunt Hamlin? That’s papa;<corr>”</corr><pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7108-051"/> and Hamlin stopped before the
                        full‐length of a handsome effeminate man.</p>
                    <p>“You wouldn’t think that he was a very violent man, would you?” he said.</p>
                    <p>“No,” answered Anne, looking at that weak, worn, rather blear face, and
                        thinking how her father, too, had been a drunkard; but how different had
                        been the drunkenness of the poor overworked mechanic, so industrious and
                        gentle and high‐spirited when he was sober, from the sort of emasculating
                        vice of Mordaunt and Arnold Hamlin, of Walter Hamlin’s bad‐faced father!</p>
                    <p>“It’s very curious,” pursued Hamlin, with a sort of psychological interest in
                        his own family, “how that Mordaunt, who, after all, was no ancestor of mine,
                        tries everywhere to perpetuate himself. There’s unfortunately no portrait of
                        my great‐grandfather, or perhaps we might understand it; but perhaps it came
                        from the mother. It’s curious I have never felt any inclination to drink—I
                        mean, however moderately; but I can’t take<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7108-052"/>
                        any wine at all—it makes me drunk at once.”</p>
                    <p>“I never have seen you take any wine, by the way,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>“I tried opium once; but Chough made me give it up. It’s sad to be denied any
                        sort of unreal pleasures, don’t you think? That’s my brother and I when we
                        were boys.”</p>
                    <p>Anne stopped to look at the picture.</p>
                    <p>It was very well painted, though a trifle old‐fashioned. The two boys were
                        represented in shooting‐jackets, with guns and dogs. The shorter, slighter,
                        and paler boy was evidently Walter Hamlin; the other was more robust,
                        boyish, and ordinary‐looking.</p>
                    <p>“Your brother died when he was a child, did he not?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no,” answered Hamlin, quickly. “Poor Arnold—was very fond of shooting—I
                        hated it; but papa had the picture painted on his account; he was the
                        favourite at first, being younger.”</p>
                    <p>It seemed to Anne that Hamlin was going<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7108-053"/> to
                        say something different from what he had said. What had become of Arnold
                        Hamlin? Mrs Macgregor’s allusions to him, who had evidently been her
                        favourite nephew, always seemed to point to a melancholy end.</p>
                    <p>“It’s curious,” said Hamlin, after a moment. “Arnold looked so jolly and
                        strong when he was a child; and yet, later, he got such a look of our
                        grand‐uncle Mordaunt.”</p>
                    <p>“I think you have your grand‐uncle on the brain,” said Anne, trying to break
                        through Hamlin’s strange mood.</p>
                    <p>They left the hall, and went to the window of the large drawing‐room, and
                        looked out on the reddening beeches and the grass, permitted to grow high
                        and thick, in the yellow sunlight.</p>
                    <p>“I shall sell this place most likely soon,” said Hamlin; “I’ve already had
                        some offers for it. It’s too large, and pompous, and characterless for me. I
                        should like a real old country‐house, two or three centuries old, with
                        flower‐gardens and panelled rooms,—not this plaster and stucco and romantic
                            gardening.<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7108-054"/> Besides, I hate this
                        place—have hated it ever since I was a child.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“I hate this place,” went on Hamlin, leaning on the window‐sill by Anne’s
                        side, “and that is the reason why I have brought you here. Before saying
                        farewell to it for good and all, I wish to save it from being a mere hateful
                        recollection in my life. I wish to be able to think of it in connection with
                        you;” and he looked up at Anne, who was leaning against the tall French
                        window.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know,” went on Hamlin, again looking out at the vaporous yellow
                        sunset horizon— “I don’t know what are destined to be the relations between
                        our lives. You have seen too little of the world as yet to be able to know
                        yourself and me; and I am more and more decided to abide by my original plan
                        of giving ourselves time to understand each other, and to understand whether
                        we are made for one another. . . .”</p>
                    <p>He looked at Anne; she had turned an ashy‐white as she listened; she had
                            thought<pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7108-055"/> that Hamlin loved her, and now
                        . . . He noticed it, and understood, but pretended not to understand; he
                        enjoyed playing upon a living soul, all the more upon a soul like this one,
                        slow to respond to his touch, with low and long‐sustained vibrations, like
                        those of some deep‐toned instrument.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t take what I say in bad part,” he went on, conscious to himself that he
                        was speaking the truth, and at the same time that he was acting, telling it
                        at a moment and in a manner which made it untruthful; “and don’t think that
                        I mean anything horrid against you or against myself, when I say that you
                        don’t yet know me, and will not know me, perhaps, for some time. You see me
                        through your own nature, your own enthusiasms, your own aspirations; you
                        think I am strong where I am weak, and pure where I am impure.”</p>
                    <p>Anne shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled sadly.</p>
                    <p>“But I do. It’s very sad to think that one<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7108-056"/>
                        must lose so much that is worth most in life, all one’s illusions, before
                        one can approach the reality of even one’s best friends,—that even one’s
                        best friends can be seen as they really are only when we have got
                        disillusioned and disappointed, is it not?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had often said things like these in the letters which he used to write
                        to her, and had hinted, much more clearly, at weaknesses and basenesses
                        which she would some day recognise in him.</p>
                    <p>It could not occur to Anne, whose character was so completely of a piece,
                        that there was any untruthfulness in this mode of speaking, any more than
                        she could believe that Hamlin could be correct in thus speaking of himself.
                        The sort of shimmer, as of the two tints in a shot stuff, of reality and
                        unreality, of genuine and affected feeling, of moods which came
                        spontaneously and of other moods, noticed, treasured up, reproduced in
                        himself,—which existed in Hamlin, would be perfectly unintelligible to
                        Anne.</p>
                    <pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7108-057"/>
                    <p>“I daresay,” she answered gravely, “that you have faults, in which, at
                        present, I cannot believe; but those faults are not the ones which you
                        imagine. When a man knows himself to have a fault, he ceases to have it—he
                        cures it.”</p>
                    <p>A sensation of a new experience passed through Hamlin’s mind as Anne said
                        this: it seemed so strange, pathetic, grand, to him—who knew himself to be
                        for ever mixing up the unrealities of his art with the realities of his
                        life, to be continually experimenting upon himself the moods of his
                        poetry—that any one should seriously think thus, should not know that when a
                        man recognises in himself a fault, he may, so far from eradicating, cherish
                        it stealthily.</p>
                    <p>“You have asked me not to be angry with you for telling me that I am
                        inexperienced and cannot yet know my own mind,” said Anne; “don’t be angry
                        and don’t laugh at me if I tell you that I think you don’t always know
                        yours. I have often observed how imaginative<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7108-058"/> you are about yourself, how apt to fancy morbid things; I suppose
                        it is because poets are always turned inwards, and because you have not
                        perhaps been very happy sometimes, and because”—and she looked at him half
                        laughing, half with the tears in her eyes—“you are very good. I daresay I
                        don’t know you thoroughly yet, but I know you—I know I know you—better
                        sometimes than you do; because you fancy all sorts of horrid mysterious
                        flaws in your character wherever there is a little inequality; and I know
                        how good and noble you are, and how you are always thinking that you must be
                        wicked.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer. He was deeply touched, touched all the more because he
                        knew how little she guessed at the self‐conscious unreality of so much of
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“You are very comforting,” he said sadly, then went on more cheerfully:
                        “well, what I wanted to say, when we began to discuss which of us knew the
                        other better, is this,—that whatever we may be destined to be to<pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7108-059"/> one another in future—and this I dare not decide
                        even in surmise—you will always have been to me, in these years that I have
                        known you, in the past and present, an infinite source of happiness and
                        good; a something which to have possessed, as I possess your friendship,
                        will always remain, even should all the reality come to an end and only the
                        recollection remain, the most precious thing in my life.” He had taken her
                        hand, and playing with her strong shapely fingers, so much stronger and less
                        delicate, though not less shapely than his own, looked with a kind of
                        solemnity into her face. Anne could not answer, for if she did, she knew she
                        must cry; she felt the tears, as it were, all through her nature; she seemed
                        to see, she knew not why, but as a solemn certainty, that things could never
                        go any further, that Hamlin was prophesying the inevitable future: and yet,
                        in the midst of this quite inexplicable, unreasonable sense of loss and
                        resignation, there was a deep happiness which she had never<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7108-060"/> before felt, the happiness of the present; a
                        something new to Anne, though all other lovers have felt the happiness of
                        possession of one another, even at the moment of loss.</p>
                    <p>“It is getting chilly,” said Hamlin, and shut the window. “You look very
                        pale, Miss Brown; had you not better put on some warmer dress this
                        evening?”</p>
                    <p>His voice seemed like the curtain dropping after a scene, or the chord at the
                        end of a duet. It was a return to reality and prose.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps I had better, and I ought to go and see after your aunt; good‐bye
                        for the present.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin strolled out into the terrace, and lit a cigarette; the past and
                        present, his real and unreal self, Anne, his brother and father, his
                        great‐uncle Mordaunt—all went cloudily through his brain. He was very happy.
                        Love to him was not what it was to other men, not what he had tried it
                        himself in former years. It was romance, but romance not of ladders and
                        hairbreadth escapes, but<pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7108-061"/> of psychical
                        conditions, of spiritual sensations. He had written fleshly poetry and
                        passionate poetry, but no one could be less fleshly or less passionate than
                        Hamlin: the ‘Vita Nuova’—if it could be made modern, and the parts altered
                        and reversed—unreal reality of love, had been his ideal, and he had got
                        it.</p>
                    <p>They had many conversations like this one. Hamlin never so much as kissed
                        Anne’s hand, never told her that he loved her, spoke merely of himself, of
                        her, of the future and the past, of what she would one day know, of what he
                        would one day feel; and Anne listened seriously, trying to cure him of his
                        despondency and morbidness, trying to persuade him of his own worth and of
                        her clear‐sightedness, while never a suspicion crossed her simple stern mind
                        that all this earnest talk, which was so tragic and still so delightful, was
                        the thing which she scornfully connected with whispers and kisses and
                        nonsense,—in one word, love‐making.</p>

                    <p><hi>THEY</hi> remained about a fortnight completely solitary in the large
                        house. Hamlin was finishing a poem and correcting the proofs of his next
                        volume. Anne was continuing her usual literary studies, but now with the
                        addition of some books and pamphlets on political economy, which had been
                        incredulously lent her by Richard Brown. The two young people had never seen
                        so much of one another, and they were, Hamlin in his dreamy manner, Anne in
                        her serious, practical way, very happy. Mrs Macgregor went on reading her
                        old‐fashioned freethinking books, and giving out cynical remarks, which her
                        amiable and utterly gullible character deprived of all weight. She was the
                        elder and considerably<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7108-063"/> older sister of
                        Hamlin’s mother, and had lived in the house for many years as a widow. She
                        had been twice married, each time for love, and each time to men who, if one
                        might trust her nephew, had been immediately reduced by her into the most
                        devoted and timid slaves; yet she always spoke of marriage as if every
                        misfortune of her existence was due to it. Imbued with the pseudo‐scientific
                        and somewhat anti‐social philosophy of early deism (though herself a rigid
                        stickler for decorum), Mrs Macgregor had a way of talking of love and
                        marriage which for some time had made poor Anne profoundly miserable: men
                        and women, averred the old lady, were, whatever they might pretend to the
                        contrary, entirely at the mercy of their animal passions,—to suppose that
                        any one successfully resisted them was sheer folly; marry people must, but
                        marriage was the most unfortunate of all necessities, the beginning of all
                        unhappiness, the end of all independence, self‐respect, and pleasure in
                        life; it was the long waking up from a disgraceful<pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7108-064"/> delusion; yet this disgraceful delusion, this drunken condition
                        called love, was (always according to Mrs Macgregor) the one beautiful and
                        poetical thing in the world.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t believe that all people are like that, Aunt Claudia,” Anne would
                        often exclaim indignantly. “I don’t believe that all people marry from
                        unworthy passion, just to wake up and find its unworthiness. I am sure that
                        if love were such a vile thing, and marriage such a mistake, every man or
                        woman with any self‐respect and self‐restraint would refuse both.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, my dear child,” Mrs Macgregor would answer with a smile, “wait till you
                        are a little older and see what a disgusting thing life is.”</p>
                    <p>“If it is,” answered Anne, feeling quite nauseated and terrified, and at the
                        same time resolute in herself—“if it is, Aunt Claudia, it is because men and
                        women are mostly such wretched, weak, silly, base, puling creatures.”</p>
                    <p>Then, when she saw Hamlin, and thought of<pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7108-065"/>
                        the noble way in which he had acted towards her, of the calm and clear love
                        and gratitude which she felt towards him,—when she thought of the things
                        which they talked about together, of the desire to become worthier with
                        which his love had inspired her, of the greater trust in his own worthiness
                        which she hoped her love was instilling into him,—nay, when she looked at
                        that thoughtful, delicate, almost diaphanous face of his, Anne’s anger
                        towards the old lady would turn into mere pity; she would merely, in her own
                        certainty of worthiness, smile at what she now considered as the mere empty
                        talk of a disgusting school of thought, or, at best, as the lamentable
                        generalisations from a horribly exceptional family, such as she understood,
                        vaguely, that of Hamlin’s father to have been. And, for the rest, Anne
                        believed that though people were very ridiculous, and affected, and mean in
                        little matters (she was thinking of the Spencers, and the Saunders, and so
                        many other of her æsthetic friends), and although they might also, like<pb n="67" xml:id="VAB7108-066"/> Cosmo Chough, make the mistake of thinking
                        indecent things interesting and dramatic, the vast majority of mankind and
                        womankind was really very pure, and generous, and loving at bottom. So,
                        after a time, she listened to Mrs Macgregor’s remarks with only a little
                        habitual and instinctive annoyance, but without any kind of serious belief
                        in them. And when Aunt Claudia would sometimes allude to the bad lives which
                        had been led in this particular house—to the vices (taking them quite as
                        ordinary matters) of Hamlin’s grandfather and father and uncles, of the
                        neglect and violence which her sister, Hamlin’s mother, had suffered from,
                        hinting that, if one only knew, the self‐same things were happening in every
                        other family on earth,—whenever there came any such allusions, Anne would
                        carefully, as it were, close up these loopholes into a past, in which she
                        scarcely believed and from which she shrank: the world seemed to her as
                        good, and healthy, and strong, and easy to understand as herself. But while
                        she did thus,<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7108-067"/> Anne was so gentle and
                        sympathising to Mrs Macgregor, that the old lady was never hurt by her
                        contradictions; indeed she would sometimes say that, were she not persuaded
                        that no law of nature can have any real exceptions, she would almost believe
                        that Anne was quite different from any other woman that ever was.</p>
                    <p>It seemed somehow, here all alone in this ancestral home of Hamlin’s, as if
                        the fate which Hamlin had refused to forestall was working itself happily
                        out; and as if, tacitly, the poet‐painter and the girl whom he had educated
                        were becoming affianced to each other. None of the outward ceremony was
                        broken through; he was always Mr Hamlin, and she Miss Brown, and there was
                        never an allusion permitted to any more intimate relations. But it seemed
                        perfectly natural that he and she should go walks together; that Aunt
                        Claudia should leave them alone at breakfast and luncheon; and that, when
                        the old lady had retired to her room, they should remain,<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7108-068"/> with brotherly and sisterly ease, though not
                        brotherly and sisterly free‐and‐easiness, talking together of an evening.
                        And as they talked, their plans seemed constantly to merge; that they should
                        be separated never occurred to either (except when Hamlin was in one of his
                        tragic moods), although not a word passed to settle their future together.
                        The long courtship, the long enjoyment of a ceremonious and unfettered love,
                        was what Hamlin had wished for, and what he had; to a fixed future, a family
                        and family affections, he was not the man to look forward; it would have to
                        come, and he did not feel any dislike for it, but he gave it no thought. As
                        to Anne, she had never made up her mind that she had a right to be Hamlin’s
                        wife; to have thought so for one moment would have seemed to her grasping
                        ingratitude; and she was too happy in the present to think about the future.
                        The thing to be thought of was to become worthy of him, that was all.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p><hi>BY</hi> the middle of the summer a perfect colony from æsthetic London
                        had settled itself, to the amazed terror of the vicar and his parishioners,
                        in Wotton Hall and the inn of the adjacent village. The Spencers came, with
                        a perfect shipload of babies, and accompanied by Mrs Spencer’s father and
                        mother; Cosmo Chough came, bringing scarcely any luggage except MS. poems
                        and old music; Thaddy O’Reilly came, and half‐a‐dozen young poets and
                        painters, to name whom would be perfectly superfluous, and who were all the
                        humble worshippers of Walter Hamlin. All these people had pictures to paint,
                        poems to compose, articles to write; but the exciting question for the whole
                        household was the approaching publication of Hamlin’s new book.</p>
                    <pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7108-070"/>
                    <p>Hamlin’s acquaintance with Anne Brown had not been without a decided
                        influence on his art. He had written a number of sonnets about her ever
                        since the moment of their first meeting, recording various moods, real and
                        fictitious, in connection with her, and of which he had sent or read her the
                        greater number. Perhaps he would have written much the same sort of thing
                        about any other woman; but Anne had influenced him at once more directly and
                        more indirectly. The æsthetic school of poetry, of which Hamlin and Chough
                        were the most brilliant exponents of the younger generation, was evidently
                        running to seed. It was beginning to be obvious, to every one who was not an
                        æsthete, that the reign of the mysterious evil passions, of the
                        half‐antique, half‐medieval ladies of saturnine beauty and bloodthirsty
                        voluptuousness of the demigods and heroes treated like the figures in a
                        piece of tapestry, must be coming to a close; and that a return to nature
                        must be preparing. Anne had felt it, and had vaguely determined<pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7108-071"/> that the man who was to revolutionise poetry was
                        Hamlin. Indeed, who else could it be? The elder poets were safe in their
                        ruts; the majority of the younger ones who had already come forward were
                        mere imitators and caricaturists, not excepting the great Chough himself.
                        Hamlin alone was a man of genius; he alone was capable of turning over a new
                        leaf; and one or two new departures, attempts at a new way of describing
                        things, if not actually an attempt at describing new things, persuaded Anne
                        that the change was beginning. She did not like telling him that she
                        perceived it coming; for she thought that Hamlin might, did he perceive it,
                        consider it as an apostasy from his original school, and draw back. But she
                        encouraged him by showing a marked preference for the pieces which savoured
                        of this new style; and she even suggested to him to write a tale, in which
                        he should substitute, for the conventional background copied by æsthetic
                        poetry from the borders of missals, the pictures of old masters and of their
                        French gods, Gautier<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7108-072"/> and Baudelaire, the
                        scenery of his own home, the wide commons, the beech‐woods on the downs, the
                        solemn horizons of the fenny country which spread from Wotton to the sea. He
                        had written it, and read it to her during that fortnight of solitude; and
                        Anne’s heart had beat at the thought of the change which was to be wrought
                        by Hamlin’s new book—of the unknown youths hitherto fumbling vainly for a
                        new style, who were to recognise in Hamlin the leader of a new school, the
                        prophet of a new art. When the colony of London æsthetes arrived at Wotton,
                        the new poem was solemnly read to them. They were all seated in the
                        old‐fashioned library, the rows and rows of old novels and books of standard
                        literature, the busts of ancient philosophers looking down upon them,—a
                        quaint little assembly of ladies in peacock‐blue and dull sage and Japanese
                        dragoned and medieval brocaded gowns, with slashed sleeves and limp tails—of
                        men got up to look like Frenchmen or Germans, or Renaissance creatures, in
                        wondrous velveteens<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7108-073"/>, colonred almost like the bindings of their own books. They
                        listened with considerable attention, and obvious impatience to interrupt.
                        The first who did so was Mrs Spencer.</p>
                    <p>“Why, Walter!” she exclaimed indignantly, “what possesses you? are you crazy?
                        Why, you are going in for realism; do you know that?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see any particular realism, Edith,” answered Hamlin, testily.</p>
                    <p>“Come, now, it isn’t Zola, my dear,” said her father, a good‐natured man, who
                        never carried his belief in himself to the length which it was carried to by
                        his family.</p>
                    <p>“No, it isn’t Zola,” cried Miss Spencer; “but it’s worse than Zola. . .
                        .”</p>
                    <p>(“It’s just the decentest thing I’ve heard for many a long year,” murmured
                        the old painter.)</p>
                    <p>“It’s worse than Zola, because it’s poetry and not prose, because it’s
                        English poetry, because it’s poetry by Walter Hamlin, who has hitherto been
                        an apostle of beauty, and is now basely turning apostate and going over to
                        ugliness.”</p>
                    <p>There was a slight laugh at Mrs Spencer’s<pb n="75" xml:id="VAB7108-074"/>
                        vehemence, in which Hamlin alone did not join.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think there’s anything actually ugly in it,” put in Chough, blandly.
                        “Hamlin could never write anything ugly. But it is certain that there’s a
                        want of idealism in it, a want of that exotic perfume which constitutes the
                        essence of poetry. I think it’s an unfortunately chosen subject. . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I think it’ s perfectly disgusting,” gobbled out Dennistoun, the little
                        rickety poet, who had to be carried up and down stairs, and who wrote, while
                        slowly sinking inch by inch into the grave, about carrying off lovely girls,
                        and throttling them in the fierceness of his love. “Did you notice about the
                        heroine washing the children? I call that beastly, beastly. And then, I
                        don’t know how any man can write a poem about people who are in love and get
                        married.”</p>
                    <p>This seemed an unanswerable piece of criticism. Anne alone leaned across the
                        table; she was very indignant. “I think,” she<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7108-075"/> said, “that there is much more poetry in people who love each other
                        respectably, and respectably get married, than in all the nasty situations
                        which modern poets write about.”</p>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough looked at Dennistoun, and Dennistoun looked at Mrs Spencer’s
                        father.</p>
                    <p>“My dear young lady,” cried the old painter in his broad Scotch, “d’ye ever
                        know any of these gentlemen write a poem about people who did any single
                        respectable thing?”</p>
                    <p>“I wonder you can talk like that, papa,” silenced his daughter, whose zeal
                        for him and his school included timely snubbings for himself.</p>
                    <p>“Well, my dear, I privately think with Miss Brown that there’s nothing more
                        poetic than a gude, bonnie lass of a wife, and I don’t wonder a bit at
                        Walter being of that opinion. But then, of course, I’m not a poet.”</p>
                    <p>“It’s that washing of the children which troubles me,” reflected Chough, “and
                        their being married. Don’t you think, now, Hamlin, that you might just alter
                        a little, and make it appear that they <emph>weren’t</emph> married?”</p>
                    <pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7108-076"/>
                    <p>“Only put a husband of the lady in the distance,” suggested O’Reilly,
                        laughing.</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” said Hamlin, affecting to laugh, “your suggestion is most happy,
                        and most characteristic. You are always full of original ideas—all of you,”
                        and he looked bitterly round. Chough felt the rebuke and was silent. But
                        Dennistoun, who was gasping, propped up in his chair, was furious.</p>
                    <p>“It’s not a question of an alteration here or there,” he gobbled out; “it’s
                        the whole tone of the poem which is pestilent. It’s Wordsworth pure and
                        simple, that’s what it is.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin rolled up his MS. He was very white. The others he did not mind, but
                        this little rickety Dennistoun, whose poems were the most limited and the
                        most hopelessly morbid of the whole set, annoyed him; for in Dennistoun, for
                        all his limitations and repetitions, Hamlin recognised the most genuine poet
                        of his circle, his most real rival. Those words, “It’s Wordsworth, that’s
                        what it is,” were like<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7108-077"/> a blow. He could
                        have knocked down Dennistoun, had he not been a cripple.</p>
                    <p>The conversation was changed; and soon the first dinner‐bell dispersed the
                        company. When Anne came down she heard some one stirring in the study next
                        door. She went in. Hamlin was seated before the table, his head on his
                        hands; the MS., all crumpled up, lay in front of him.</p>
                    <p>Anne came silently to his side. Her heart was bursting with indignation.</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” asked Hamlin, crossly.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing. I only came—because I wanted to see you—because I wanted to tell
                        you how I despise those people and their disgusting, unmanly school of
                        poetry—how I hate their stupid criticism,—how completely I believe in you
                        and in your poem.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had spoken with vehemence and almost anger. She took one of his hands,
                        which was dog’s‐earing the MS.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, why,” she asked, “why do you read<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7108-078"/> them
                        what you write? Don’t you know them sufficiently to know what they will
                        say?”</p>
                    <p>“I never thought—” and Hamlin stopped. “I never thought that that fellow
                        Dennistoun would ever dare to speak like that about a poem of mine.” His
                        tone was angry and tearful, like that of a punished child.</p>
                    <p>“Nor did I. I never thought any one would dare to speak like that. But what
                        does it matter—what can the words of such a man matter to you?”</p>
                    <p>He did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“Surely,” went on Anne, “you can’t mind what they say? You believe in your
                        poem, as I believe in it?”</p>
                    <p>It seemed so impossible to her how any one could not believe in that poem,
                        which seemed to her so strong, and noble, and beautiful.</p>
                    <p>“I know you believe in it,” answered Hamlin, brusquely; “you made me write
                        it—so of course you must—”</p>
                    <p>“And—and—are you sorry to have written it?”</p>
                    <pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7108-079"/>
                    <p>“I don’t know; I can’t judge. There’s O’Reilly outside.”</p>
                    <p>“The disconsolate poet being consoled by his beautiful <foreign xml:lang="fre">fiancée</foreign> for having written about people who
                        were united in legitimate wedlock,” whispered O’Reilly to Mrs Spencer as
                        they entered the room.</p>
                    <p>“Well, Hamlin, old fellow, do you repent you of that sinful marriage between
                        your hero and heroine?” asked O’Reilly.</p>
                    <p>“I repent me of nothing at all, except of having read my poem to a parcel of
                        damned meretricious rhymesters,” answered Hamlin, angrily.</p>
                    <p>“Walter!” cried Mrs Spencer, “how can you talk like that!”</p>
                    <p>But, despite this bravado, Anne felt, and her spirit sank within her, that
                        Hamlin had been disgusted with his poem. He was rather cantankerous
                        throughout dinner; and Anne, watching him, felt a strange mixture of
                        indignation—towards his critics for their criticism, and towards Hamlin for
                        minding it.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> time has come for him to break with the old school, thought
                        Anne; consoling herself for a certain childish petulance, perhaps not quite
                        new to her, in Hamlin’s manner.</p>
                    <p>But Anne proved mistaken. Whether the critics became less rabid on the
                        following day, or whether Hamlin was suddenly smitten with the truth of
                        their criticism, she could not say. He was very snappish at first towards
                        Chough, and absolutely refused to speak to Dennistoun for nearly twenty‐four
                        hours. Chough, who loved Hamlin like the apple of his eye, would not,
                        however, be spurned; he followed Hamlin about, he soothed him, he flattered
                        him, he assured him that he was much the greatest poet of his generation;
                        but he repeated, almost<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7108-081"/> with tears in his eyes, Dennistoun’s criticism.</p>
                    <p>“Such a poem will <emph>never, never</emph> do,” he cried; “it is impossible,
                        intolerable, and it will just put some fellow like Dennistoun into your
                        place.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you for your advice, Chough,” answered Hamlin, angrily; “I think I
                        told you before that I didn’t want it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not revive the subject of the unlucky poem. It was useless provoking
                        quarrels between Hamlin and his friends; quarrels in which she was forced to
                        own to herself that he showed himself too easily mortified and put out of
                        temper. If he had been taught to mistrust their judgment, if he had been
                        alienated from their school by their absurd criticism, why, so much the
                        better. This business drew Anne’s attention to the poetry of the school; she
                        re‐read a number of poems by Chough, Dennistoun, and several gods, demigods,
                        and heroes of the movement. Whether it was that she had read<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7108-082"/> them fragmentarily before, or that she had not
                        understood their full meaning, or whether her attention was now called to
                        their bad points rather than to their good ones, she scarcely knew; but it
                        seemed to her that she had never before comprehended this style of poetry:
                        its beauty had ceased to please her, it seemed to her false, emasculate,
                        diseased. Hamlin alone had not gone to its worst lengths; he had sinned, but
                        comparatively little. He was evidently intended for something better. And
                        Anne thought with pride of that “Ballad of the Fens” which they had all
                        fallen upon, and which was to be the signal for a new era in poetry. Soon it
                        would be out; and she the only person to have appreciated it. It seemed to
                        Anne that at last, in her humble way, she might be beginning to repay the
                        debt of gratitude which she owed Hamlin (not that she wished that the debt
                        should ever be less, God knows, or dreamed that it could be); but at last
                        Hamlin might reap some advantage from his generosity. He<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7108-083"/> had stooped to make her, to turn the Perrys’
                        servant into a lady; in her turn, perhaps she, the woman of the lower
                        classes, might encourage the delicately nurtured poet to attempt things
                        bolder, simpler, and more healthy than he had done before.</p>
                    <p>The proof‐sheets of the new volume began to come in. Anne had read nearly all
                        its contents at one time or other, yet Hamlin, in his grave, ceremoniously
                        adoring way, handed on the proofs to her. One day a fresh bundle came by
                        post. After breakfast, Hamlin took Anne aside.</p>
                    <p>“I want you to read these sonnets,” he said. “I don’t think you have read
                        them all. There are rather more than I care to print in this volume, so I
                        should like you to select those which you think the best or the least bad:
                        divide them into two packets, and tell me which you prefer.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was quite taken aback for joy, and at the same time for fear.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t say that,” she said; “I could never,<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7108-084"/>
                        never take the responsibility of deciding about your poems. Let me read
                        them, and let me tell you what I like best, but don’t ask me to choose. What
                        am I, that I should decide in such matters?”</p>
                    <p>“You are the person whom I trust and respect, and—will you let me say
                        so?—whom I love most in all the world,” said Hamlin, solemnly. “For whom
                        should my poetry be written except for you? Whom else should I care to
                        please? Are you not the best and worthiest thing in my life, and is it not
                        my highest ambition to do anything worthy of you?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had never spoken so passionately and earnestly before.</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer, but she squeezed his hand, and the gesture, and the look
                        accompanying it, meant “I love you.”</p>
                    <p>“Listen,” said Hamlin, detaining her as she was leaving—“I want to say one
                        word more. These sonnets are not merely my verses; they are myself—and many
                        of them, you will see, are about you. Perhaps you<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7108-085"/> would rather that some of these were not
                        published; perhaps your permitting them to be published might mean more than
                        you should wish. Tell me your opinion frankly, and put aside everything that
                        you don’t like.”</p>
                    <p>“I will,” answered Anne. “What you wish me to do, I must do.”</p>
                    <p>She went up into her room, shut the door, and seating herself at the table,
                        unrolled the little bundle of proof‐sheets. But at first she could not read,
                        or could read only the titles—her heart beat so, and the blood boomed so in
                        her temples. That he should love her so much, believe in her so much—that it
                        should really be he, just he and she, and not some one else; it seemed too
                        strange to be true. She slowly began to read the sonnets. Some of them she
                        knew already; others were expansions in verse of things which Hamlin had
                        said or written to her; many were about herself, passionate, with a sort of
                        delicate, subdued, respectful passion, played, like some exquisite
                        instrument, in various keys and rhythms of subdued pain or<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7108-086"/> gladness. She felt so proud and glad, and at the
                        same time so moved and saddened, that she almost cried over them. There were
                        a lot of other sonnets, descriptive of places and of moods. Some of these
                        she did not at all relish. They were not fleshly nor exactly improper; but
                        they contained allusions which Anne could not help following, allusions
                        which she did not quite understand, but which she did not like. She felt
                        half ashamed of herself, wondering whether all the impure poetry which she
                        had lately been reading, whether her prejudice against the school to which
                        these decidedly belonged, might not be making her imagine things which were
                        not meant; and Anne blushed at the thought—blushed at her knowing so many
                        things, having learned so many things, in her half education as an Italian
                        servant, in her culture as an æsthetic personage, which perhaps other girls
                        of her age would not dream of. It was probably only her own morbid fancy.
                        But then she came upon a set of sonnets—<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7108-087"/> no
                        fewer than twelve connected together by similarity of title—which put an end
                        to her doubts. She felt giddy and sick as she read them; mysterious and
                        mystical hankerings, mysterious half‐longing repentance, and half‐repentant
                        longings after untold shameful things. Anne pushed aside the proof‐sheets,
                        and leaned her head on her hands. She seemed to be smothering for want of
                        air; she went to the window, and leaned against its rails. It was raining—a
                        steady, clear fine rain. She looked at it mechanically as it filled the air
                        like a thin veil, and crevassed the sand outside with yellow trickles of
                        water. She did not for one instant believe that Hamlin had ever felt the
                        things about which he was writing; but he had written about them. She knew,
                        from an unerring instinct, as well as from her own deep love, that Hamlin
                        was as pure a man as could be found; had he not been towards her—was he not,
                        at that very moment—the very personification of chivalrous and spiritual
                        lovingness? Then she<pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7108-088"/> remembered the
                        allusions which, without understanding them, used to frighten her in his
                        letters—the allusions to vague evil which beckoned to him, which surrounded
                        him; and she remembered also his constant references in conversation to his
                        being unlike what she imagined, to his baseness and unworthiness. Two years
                        earlier she would have been seized with an agonising terror; a week before
                        she might have been overcome with pitying admiration at his self‐tormenting
                        moral purity, taking umbrage at every thought of evil which passed across
                        and seemed to soil his mind. But somehow, now, she did neither. She did not
                        for one second believe that Hamlin was in any way a bad man. She repeated to
                        herself that he was morbidly introspective, self‐scrutinising, morbidly
                        imaginative; but she could not realise that these hateful sonnets had been
                        written in any great agony of imagined self‐debasement; they were so
                        artistic, so evidently written with enjoyment, so self‐conscious; they were
                        so clearly not the<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7108-089"/> doubts of a troubled
                        mind, but the work of a poet—and, what was much worse, so clearly the work
                        of a poet of a definite school, of the school of Chough and Dennistoun and
                        all the others, whom she was beginning to loathe. Anne looked at them over
                        and over again. There was no reality in them; mere revolting
                            <emph>pose</emph>. Gradually her mind settled about them. They were
                        doubtless things written long ago, when, without knowing what it all meant,
                        he had been carried away by the wave of imitation of one or two shameless or
                        foolish writers. He had alluded to sonnets which he had expected her to
                        dislike, he had insisted so on a certain number being put aside; if he had
                        made her think that it was the sonnets about herself which provoked his
                        doubts, that came from a sort of shame, an unwillingness to point out to her
                        what she might perhaps overlook: it was not quite straightforward, but
                        everybody, Anne had learned by this time, did not do right in a quite
                        straightforward way. The only thing which perplexed her was, why he<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7108-090"/> had submitted these poems to her at all?
                        Why had he not torn them up? why shown them to her? A little she could not
                        help, as a woman, resenting his having done so at all. But perhaps he had
                        done so to show her the difference between what he had been and what he was
                        going to be,—perhaps—perhaps he had got a little callous, living among poets
                        of this school. Anyhow, they were things of the past, and Anne did not
                        distress herself any longer about them, so foreign did they seem to Hamlin,
                        so impossible was it to bring them into connection with the thought of him.
                        She put the proofs into her pocket, and waited for an opportunity of giving
                        them back. Before dinner, when the guests were safe out of the way, she
                        called Hamlin into the library.</p>
                    <p>“Here are the proofs,” she said, laying them on the table.</p>
                    <p>“Have you read them already?” cried Hamlin; “how sweet of you! Now tell me
                        what you think about them.”</p>
                    <p>He looked so cheerful, so utterly unconscious<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7108-091"/> of the possibility of Anne’s having anything to say disagreeable
                        to himself and herself, that she began to feel nervous.</p>
                    <p>“I think they are most of them very beautiful,” she answered slowly—“indeed,
                        quite some of the best things you have ever done—and especially those about
                        me; I am very grateful to you for them. But”—she resumed, after a moment’s
                        silence—“there are some which I dislike extremely, and which are utterly
                        unworthy of you. I have put them into the smaller roll by themselves.” She
                        spoke rapidly, decidedly, but when she had done she felt that she was
                        crimson.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin seemed quite speechless for astonishment. He quickly unrolled the
                        smaller parcel, and glanced at its contents. A look of surprised ill‐humour
                        crossed his face.</p>
                    <p>“I am quite astonished at your choice,” he said with affected coolness; “for
                        these are the very sonnets which Chough and Dennistoun and all my other
                        friends picked out as among my best.”</p>
                    <pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7108-092"/>
                    <p>So he had already provided himself with a stock of criticisms.</p>
                    <p>“I am no judge of their technical merits,” answered Anne, trying to feel as
                        if she had expected this news. “It seemed to me that they were very
                        excellent in workmanship, and there is beautiful imagery in them. But I
                        think the subject and tone of them horrible.” she spoke resolutely and
                        unflinchingly, because she saw Hamlin’s eyes fixed incredulously on her.
                        “You asked me to give you my frank opinion; and even had you not asked me, I
                        should have felt bound to tell you that I think those sonnets ought not to
                        be published. Perhaps you think it strange of me to speak so openly; but, of
                        course, I understand what those sonnets allude to, and, of course, so will
                        every grown‐up reader.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin bit his moustache.</p>
                    <p>“There is not a single word to which any one can take objection in these
                        sonnets,” and he turned over the proofs.</p>
                    <p>“What do the words matter? It is the<pb n="94" xml:id="VAB7108-093"/>
                        meaning. I think,” and Anne vainly tried to soften down her expressions,—“I
                        think that those sonnets are things you should be ashamed of.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s eyes flashed, but he kept his temper.</p>
                    <p>“Everything is legitimate for the sake of an artistic effect,” he said,
                        echoing the worn‐out aphorism of his school.</p>
                    <p>“Even to do a disgraceful thing?”</p>
                    <p>“I can see nothing disgraceful in a man attempting to describe what has
                        passed through his mind.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin spoke sullenly and doggedly.</p>
                    <p>“You have shifted your position,” cried Anne. “You intimated just now that a
                        man may pretend to anything for the sake of an artistic effect. And now you
                        are trying to make me believe that you really have felt and thought those
                        horrible things. It is of no use. You have not—”</p>
                    <p>“How do you know?” exclaimed Hamlin, angrily. “Do you think I tell you
                        everything that I have ever done, or thought, or felt?”</p>
                    <pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7108-094"/>
                    <p>Anne was silent for a moment: that he should prefer to make her believe in
                        his own baseness! It was horrible, loathsome, and, at the same time,
                        pitiable and childish.</p>
                    <p>“I know you have not,” she repeated, “because I know you to be a gentleman.
                        And I know that all that is affectation—school affectation—learned from
                        creatures like Dennistoun and Chough; they have all done it, or something of
                        the sort, and you have learned what comes naturally to their dirty minds.
                        Oh, Mr Hamlin, do not commit this abomination—this baseness of pretending to
                        shameful things which you have not felt or thought; do not be so mean, so
                        base, so lying, as to slander yourself for the sake of an artistic effect.”
                        Anne had seized his arm; he was shaken by her unexpected vehemence and
                        passion; he had never thought that Anne could become so passionate about
                        anything; he looked on, taken by surprise, not knowing what to think.</p>
                    <p>“Do not slander yourself,” repeated Anne—“do not blacken your real self,
                        which does not<pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7108-095"/> belong to yourself alone,
                        which belongs also to your friends, to your honour, which belongs in part to
                        me. Do not lie to me about yourself!”</p>
                    <p>“As you choose,” answered Hamlin; “perhaps you are right; though, heaven
                        knows, I thought myself, when writing those sonnets, but too bitterly in
                        earnest.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s look—a look of incredulous contempt—smote him like a rod.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose I am apt to be morbid,” he said, sadly; “that is the wretchedness
                        of my life, that I never know where the truth about myself really lies—it
                        seems to me that I ought to speak out, and yet . . .”</p>
                    <p>“And yet it is mere nonsense.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled a forced smile.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps it is. Since you are determined, I suppose it must be.”</p>
                    <p>“You won’t publish those sonnets?” asked Anne, anxiously.</p>
                    <p>“I will not, since they offend you so much. But it is curious, that of all
                        the people to<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7108-096"/> whom I have shown them, you
                        are the only one who has taken the slightest exception to them.”</p>
                    <p>For a moment Hamlin had been overcome, had been delighted by this sudden
                        burst of impetuosity, by this passionate belief in him and vindication of
                        himself. But now, as he again glanced at the sonnets, he was once more
                        annoyed and resentful.</p>
                    <p>“Such things must be judged from a purely artistic standpoint,” he said with
                        some irritation.</p>
                    <p>“I am willing to judge art from an artistic standpoint; but I cannot judge
                        from an artistic standpoint an honourable man trying to defame himself.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin sighed.</p>
                    <p>“Well, after all, I bade you select, and the principal thing is that you
                        should be satisfied. But it <emph>is</emph> a pity, because those were just
                        the best sonnets in the book; and the book will be very small without the
                        ‘Ballad of the Fens.’”</p>
                    <p>“The ‘Ballad of the Fens’?—aren’t you going to print that? What do you
                        mean?”</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7108-097"/>
                    <p>Could Hamlin be merely worrying her, to vent his annoyance at the loss of the
                        sonnets?</p>
                    <p>“The ‘Ballad of the Fens’ has been torn up,” answered Hamlin, with a kind of
                        dogged satisfaction.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Mr Hamlin! How could you—the finest thing you have ever written.”</p>
                    <p>The ballad torn up!</p>
                    <p>“I know you thought it good, and so did I myself. But, on reflection, I saw
                        that my friends were right, and that such a thing would not do.”</p>
                    <p>He spoke sharply, brutally, as if to bring home to Anne the unreliableness of
                        her judgment: she had induced him to write it; she had praised it; and she
                        wanted him to tear up those sonnets.</p>
                    <p>“It is a bad plan to keep things about which one is doubtful,” he went on;
                        “so I tore it up. I think it was wiser; don’t you?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” said Anne, in a husky voice which burst out in a way that almost
                        frightened him; “no, no—it was . . .” but she said no more.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                    <p><hi>ONE</hi> morning Hamlin received two unexpected letters at breakfast.
                        From his looks, which he was at all times quite unable to control, it was
                        clear that one of them brought good news, while the other must be about some
                        disagreeable matter.</p>
                    <p>“Edmund Lewis is coming the day after to‐morrow,” announced Hamlin to his
                        aunt, to Anne, and to his guests.</p>
                    <p>There was a chorus of exclamations of surprise, sprinkled with pleasure.</p>
                    <p>“Who is Edmund Lewis?” asked Anne. “He is an old friend of mine, a charming
                        fellow whom I have not seen for some years. Some of the drawings in the
                        drawing‐room at Hammersmith are by him.”</p>
                    <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7108-099"/>
                    <p>Anne remembered the name, and the strange, beautiful, cruel, mysterious,
                        out‐of‐drawing heads in crayon, which had curiously impressed her the first
                        morning after her arrival in England, rose before her eyes; since then she
                        had seen so many similar things, had got to understand so completely that
                        mysterious, beautiful faces, with combed‐out hair, big weird eyes, and cruel
                        lips, were so much school property, that she had become quite indifferent to
                        them.</p>
                    <p>“I thought you told me that something strange had happened to him—that he had
                        left England for good,” remarked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, it was nothing particularly strange,” interrupted little O’Reilly—“only
                        a German lady whom he met one day, blond, fat, thirty‐five, who was nothing
                        but a soul—you know the sort of thing—with a husband who was a great deal
                        besides a soul (a charming man, for the rest, and quite wildly in love with
                        the <corr>Gnädige</corr> Frau). The excess of soul having induced acute neuralgia in the
                            lady,<pb n="101" xml:id="VAB7108-100"/> poor Teddy Lewis, who is a
                        tremendous magnetiser, was called in to soothe her agonies, during which
                        process the lady discovered that the soul‐sorrow and consequent neuralgia
                        from which she suffered was due to the soullessness of her husband, and that
                        only the brotherly affection of Ted could cure her. The difficulty was the
                        husband, who loved the lady fervently, and she him, but not in a way which
                        should satisfy her soul. Hence struggles, agonies, &amp;c.—you’ve read
                        it all in the ‘Wahlverwandschaften’—finally ended by the husband being
                        implored to sacrifice himself to the spiritual exigencies of his adored
                        wife, which absolutely required that he should divorce her and let her marry
                        Lewis. That’s all.”</p>
                    <p>“How can you talk in such a flippant way, Mr O’Reilly?” cried Mrs Spencer.
                        “You have a way of making the most serious things seem ridiculous. Poor Mrs
                        Lewis! she’s dead now; you needn’t make fun of her.”</p>
                    <p>“Poor Mrs Lewis!” laughed O’Reilly;<pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7108-101"/> “well,
                        you know you wouldn’t receive her, Mrs Spencer, when she first came to
                        England.”</p>
                    <p>“I thought her a designing woman then; I didn’t know all the
                        circumstances.”</p>
                    <p>“Come now, Edith,” interrupted her father, in his broad Scotch; “I
                            <emph>think</emph> the less ye knew those circumstances the better it
                        was for all concerned.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see that at all, papa. I don’t see why a woman’s happiness should be
                        sacrificed,” and Mrs Spencer, who was the most devoted of wives and mothers,
                        tossed her head rebelliously. “I don’t see why the world should insist that
                        a woman is to be satisfied with a husband who is good to her and her
                        children. After all, she has a soul, and that requires response.”</p>
                    <p>“Would you behave as Mrs Lewis did?” asked O’Reilly, “If—well—let me see—Mr
                        Spencer were suddenly to develop an overpowering belief in the Royal Academy
                        and in Zola?”</p>
                    <pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7108-102"/>
                    <p>“Papa would never have let me marry a man who <emph>could</emph> ever develop
                        such beliefs.”</p>
                    <p>At this perfectly solemn answer there was a general laugh; even poor Mr
                        Spencer, who was the most timid of æsthetical persons, joining.</p>
                    <p>“I think it was rather hard on poor Ted Lewis,” remarked Hamlin, “to become
                        necessary to the soul of a lady whether he liked it or no.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Lewis liked it well enough, be sure of that,” answered Chough,
                        bitterly.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t you think it was rather hard upon the husband,” suggested Anne, “since
                        he really cared for his wife? Fancy being abandoned like that, and his
                        children left without a mother!”</p>
                    <p>“He was at liberty to marry again,” replied Mrs Spencer sharply, still
                        thinking of what she would do if by any chance Mr Spencer were to suddenly
                        disbelieve in her father and his school.</p>
                    <p>“What would you have had Lewis, or rather<pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7108-103"/>
                        the poor Baroness, do, Miss Brown?” asked O’Reilly.</p>
                    <p>“Why, I would have them never dream of each other; but if they had been so
                        foolish, be ashamed as soon as possible, and each go his and her way, and
                        attend to his and her proper concerns.”</p>
                    <p>Dennistoun, who had sat silent at the other end of the table, propped up on
                        his chair, suddenly stretched out his long neck, and gobbled out—</p>
                    <p>“Love permits no man or woman to resist: it is imperious, irresistible,
                        dragging us along to happiness, or misery, or shame, whether we will or not.
                        Love is the extinction of the reason, the extinction of the will, or rather
                        the merging of the whole individuality in one mysterious desire. Those who
                        can talk of resistance have never experienced love. Woe to them! their hour
                        is coming!”—and he tried to fix his weak eyes on Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Well,” she answered quickly, “I hope I may never make such a disgusting fool
                        of myself<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7108-104"/> as you describe, Mr Dennistoun; but as I think that not everybody
                        is liable to go mad, so also I think that not everybody is liable to falling
                        in love in your sense of the word.”</p>
                    <p>O’Reilly leaned over the back of her chair.</p>
                    <p>“It happens only to those who want to write about it, Miss Brown,” he
                        whispered.</p>
                    <p>“Anyhow,” remarked Hamlin, “Lewis is a charming fellow, and I am sure you
                        will appreciate him, Miss Brown. He is, moreover, the most backbitten man in
                        creation,” and Hamlin glanced round the table; “but you must never believe
                        any harm of him.”</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, thought Anne, Edmund Lewis was disliked by this set for the same
                        reasons which, she could not help understanding, were beginning to make her
                        vaguely unpopular. Still, she did not like the story of his marriage, she
                        did not like the recollection of his morbidly beautiful drawings.</p>
                    <p>“It’s good news about Lewis,” said Hamlin to her after breakfast; “but
                            unfortunately<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7108-105"/> there’s been rather a
                        bothering letter also. Did I ever mention a cousin of mine, the daughter of
                        papa’s sister and of a horrible Russian creature called Polozoff? She was
                        brought up with us as a child, and is connected with a great many painful
                        circumstances. I have completely lost sight of her since she was about
                        fifteen, and now I suddenly get a letter from her telling me that her
                        husband is dead, and that she is coming to England. I rather loathe the idea
                        of her, and if you knew the part she played in this house fifteen years ago,
                        you could understand it. But the worst is that Aunt Claudia perfectly
                        abhorred her—I will tell you the horrible, prosaic, tragic story some
                        day—and that I perfectly dread having to break the news to her. I do hate a
                        scene so! There she is; I suppose I’d better tell her.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor was walking slowly up and down the gravel walk before the
                        house.</p>
                    <p>“Do come and keep me in countenance.<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7108-106"/> It
                        really is no fault of mine, but I know my aunt will be furious.”</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” cried Mrs Macgregor suspiciously, as if expecting to be
                        told something disagreeable.</p>
                    <p>“I wanted to tell you, Aunt Claudia,” said Hamlin, “that I had a letter this
                        morning.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I know, from your dear Lewis,” interrupted Mrs Macgregor. “What’s that
                        to me?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean that one. I had a letter from—guess from whom?” and Hamlin
                        tried to smile—“from Cousin Sacha.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor recoiled as if she had trodden on a toad.</p>
                    <p>“From whom?”</p>
                    <p>“From Cousin Sacha. Sacha Polozoff—Madame Elaguine, I suppose I ought to call
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>For a moment there was a dead silence. The old lady’s face, usually so
                        vacant, was lit up into a terrific energy of anger.</p>
                    <p>“ What business has <emph>she</emph> to write to <emph>you</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>“Well, really, aunt, I don’t see why she shouldn’t,” answered Hamlin. “After
                            all,<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7108-107"/> we are cousins, and we have never
                        openly quarrelled.</p>
                    <p>”My aunt,“ he explained, turning to Anne, ”has got a tremendous aversion—a
                        prejudice—towards this one and only cousin of mine. She disliked her father,
                        very reasonably, and I think she has let her dislike descend to the second
                        generation rather unreasonably.“</p>
                    <p>”Unreasonably!“ exclaimed Mrs Macgregor; ”<emph>you</emph> know it was not
                        unreasonable, Walter—you know what that Cousin Sacha of yours was in this
                        house.“</p>
                    <p>”I know nothing of the sort,“ cried Hamlin, angrily. ”I know that Sacha lived
                        in this house as a child; I know she left it as a child; I know we all hated
                        her and hers, and that perhaps they deserved it; but I know that we have no
                        right to hate a woman of whom we know nothing, because she happened to have
                        been a badly brought up child, years ago.</p>
                    <p>“At all events,” went on Hamlin, “I insist upon her being properly treated as
                        a lady, and a relation.”</p>
                    <pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7108-108"/>
                    <p>“Properly treated!” almost foamed out his aunt. “Do you mean to say that she
                        is coming <emph>here</emph>?”</p>
                    <p>“Not here; but to London. Her husband is dead; and she writes to me that she
                        thinks she had better send her boy to an English school; and as the only
                        person in England upon whom she has a claim—”</p>
                    <p>“A pretty claim!” interrupted Mrs Macgregor.</p>
                    <p>“As her first cousin, she has written to me for information and
                        assistance.”</p>
                    <p>“And you are going to give it her, Walter?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course I am. And I hope, Aunt Claudia, that you will remember that I
                        won’t be disgraced towards a lady who has done us no harm. She will be in
                        London, most likely, when we return at the beginning of winter.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had heard many allusions to this Cousin Sacha, and they belonged to that
                        class of cynical hints which always made her indignant with Mrs Macgregor.
                        She instinctively took part with this unknown woman,<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7108-109"/> and she admired Hamlin’s decision and generosity.
                        Why did he not always act like this?</p>
                    <p>“That child—that Sacha,” said Mrs Macgregor, when Hamlin had left them, “was
                        the evil genius of his house. She was sent as if to embody all the bad
                        tendencies of the family. It was a miserable house at best, my
                        brother‐in‐law’s, for he was a weak, vicious, violent man. But just when
                        this wretched child was brought to us my sister had died, Mr Hamlin was very
                        much shaken and repentant for the life he had led her, and I really believe
                        that he had made up his mind to live decently for the sake of his children.
                        The two boys were growing up, and there seemed some chance of things going
                        quietly and happily. Then Mr Hamlin thought fit to invite home his sister,
                        who was a widow; she had married a horrible Russian, a sort of indecent
                        madman, with every possible vice under the sun. She was an odious woman
                        herself, the regular slave‐driving type of the Hamlins. Oh, you can’t judge
                        of them from<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7108-110"/> Walter; he’s like my sister,
                        not like them. Well, she was violent, and overbearing, and tyrannical, and
                        lazy, and hysterical, like a regular Jamaica woman. She was enough in the
                        house; but then she had this child of hers, this Sacha, with her—a wretched,
                        neglected creature, brought up by French servants, who were her father’s
                        mistresses, and literally with no more idea of right and wrong than any of
                        the little heathens whom they pick out of gutters in the East End and send
                        to reformatories.”</p>
                    <p>“Poor child!” said Anne. She shuddered at this glimpse into Hamlin’s early
                        life; it had a horrible attraction for her, and yet she felt that she would
                        far rather know nothing about it. All this filth seemed to cling to her mind
                        and soil it. “How horrible for her!”</p>
                    <p>“She was about twelve when she came to us,” went on Mrs Macgregor
                        meditatively, “and you couldn’t believe that such a child could exist in
                        Christendom. She could no more spell the simplest word than I can speak<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7108-111"/> Arabic; she spoke an awful jargon of
                        English and French and Russian and German, and she used to talk about
                        things, and repeat stories which she had heard from her nurses, or her
                        father, or her father’s friends—I don’t know whom—that were enough to make
                        your hair stand on end. Mr Hamlin was in perfect despair; because, although
                        he was a vicious sort of man himself, and quite did my poor sister to death
                        with his bad conduct, he was awfully strict about all his kith and kin, and
                        kept the boys as tight as if he had been a Puritan. What we all had to go
                        through, you have no idea. At first I was quite ashamed to let any governess
                        see such a little heathen as that child was, and we had to pay the
                        governesses double wages to keep them on. Then, every time that they tried
                        to break Sacha off some one of her disgusting ways, her mother, who was
                        always moaning and groaning with imaginary maladies on her sofa, and no more
                        thought of her daughter than of the man in the moon, would go into
                            hysterics<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7108-112"/> and throw things in their
                        face, and have them turned away, and keep Sacha for a day in her room,
                        kissing her and giving her sweets. Well, we thought we were little by little
                        getting the better of her; and then, thank goodness, Madame Polozoff, that
                        was Mr Hamlin’s sister, died. Sacha learned a few things, and began to
                        behave a little more like a Christian child; but it was only on the surface.
                        She was utterly and thoroughly corrupt. When the boys returned from school
                        (Arnold was sixteen, and Walter seventeen), the mischief began. That
                        wretched Sacha fell madly in love with Walter, and began running after him;
                        but Walter perfectly loathed the sight of her: he was always the cold,
                        moral, irreproachable sort of creature that he is. Then she went after
                        Arnold. Arnold was much the livelier of the two: he was a dear, warm‐
                        hearted, simple sort of boy, a perfect scapegrace, always in pickles, but we
                        only liked him the better. But that wretched Sacha (he didn’t care a rap
                        about her either,<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7108-113"/> for she was a horrid,
                        lying, sickly, stunted little thing), in order to curry favour with him, put
                        him up to all sorts of mischief, which I suppose she had learned from her
                        precious father and his servants. What was poor Arnold to know? The nasty
                        little fiend used to get out of bed and unlock the house‐door for him, so
                        that he might go in and out at night and get into scrapes with the village
                        girls, and drink at the pot‐house; and she used to steal the wine and the
                        brandy out of the cupboards for him, and teach him all sorts of
                        ungentlemanly, knavish, lying ways; I believe she used even to give him
                        money out of her savings, just for him to go to the pot‐house. If ever a boy
                        was ruined by a woman, poor Arnold was ruined by that miserable Sacha. Then,
                        in return for her assistance and her lies and her money, he had to pretend
                        to like her, to kiss her, and call her his darling little cousin, and
                        promise to marry her, whom he abominated. Meanwhile Walter went dreaming on
                        as he always<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7108-114"/> has, avoiding Sacha like the
                        plague, and not perceiving any of the pretty doings of his brother; and Mr
                        Hamlin, who thought that his house, just because it was his house, must be
                        the palace of virtue, and his son, because he was his son, must be the most
                        obedient and austere boy in the world, took to liking Sacha and her pretty,
                        foreign little ways, and to think her quite a nice little girl, just the
                        wife for one of his sons. Then one day (I suppose Sacha thought that poor
                        Arnold did not kiss her and <emph>darling little Sacha</emph> her enough, or
                        got jealous or something) they had a great row, and Arnold called her a
                        liar, and said that if she were not a girl he would thrash her well. So
                        Sacha rushed off sobbing to Mr Hamlin, and told him that Arnold had called
                        her a liar, and had threatened to beat her; and Mr Hamlin called Arnold, and
                        struck him in the face till his nose bled, and called him a coward and a
                        brute, and swore he would cut him off with a shilling. Then it all came out
                        about Arnold’s escapades,<pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7108-115"/> his nights at
                        the pot‐house, and so forth; and of course his father said that all he said
                        about Sacha’s putting him up to it was a pack of lies, and finally it ended
                        with Mr Hamlin behaving in such a way that poor Arnold ran away to America.
                        Then we had no news of him for about six months, and Mr Hamlin wanted to
                        take Walter into his good graces, although he had never cared for him, and
                        Sacha tried to make up to Walter. But Walter also ran away to his uncle,
                        because he said he would not stay unless Arnold was recalled, or at least
                        money were sent to him. So Mr Hamlin had to give in and send for Arnold; but
                        meanwhile he had quarrelled with Sacha, and packed her off to her Russian
                        relatives, who sent her to some German deaconesses on the Rhine—a nice child
                        to bring up! Walter returned, and began to prepare for the university; then
                        Arnold was got back from America; but he had only got into worse and worse
                        ways—he was always drunk, and finally his mind began to give<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7108-116"/> way. Poor Arnold! he was much, much nicer than
                        Walter—such a bright, good‐humoured, manly fellow—and now . . .”</p>
                    <p>“Now?” repeated Anne in astonishment; she had listened without saying a word
                        to this horrible page of family history. “Now? Do you mean that Mr Hamlin’s
                        brother is alive?”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor looked at her with strange wide eyes. “Of course he is. We say
                        he is dead; or if not dead, mad. Well, he might as soon be either, poor boy.
                        He wanders about with a servant. Walter allows him some money. We never talk
                        of him. Ah!” cried Mrs Macgregor, and it was a kind of suppressed cry of
                        pain—“and that it is all, all owing to Sacha Polozoff; and she has the
                        insolence to write to Walter!”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not know what to say.</p>
                    <p>“But,” she could not help saying after a minute, for it seemed to her as if
                        the whole story were so unjust, so one‐sided, as if there were so much too
                        much laid at the door of<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7108-117"/> the unhappy,
                        neglected, corrupt child—so much too little pity or indignation shown at her
                        having been thus neglected and corrupted,—“but, Aunt Claudia—is it fair to
                        put it all down to Sacha? After all, Arnold was sixteen, he was a man, he
                        had been decently brought up—and she, she was an ignorant child, brought up
                        as you say without idea of right or wrong. Don’t you think—oh, don’t you
                        think, auntie dear, that it was mainly the fault of old Mr Hamlin, and his
                        bad example, and his closing his eyes to his boy’s behaviour?” It seemed to
                        her so frightful that a girl, a child, a victim, just because she was a
                        victim, should have such a weight of guilt thrown upon her.</p>
                    <p>“She was a woman, and he was a man,” said Mrs Macgregor fiercely, her love
                        for her lost nephew, and her strange theories of sexual influences mixing
                        grotesquely and tragically—“and a woman can always do what she will with a
                        man; a woman can always, unless she be as weak as my poor<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7108-118"/> sister, ruin or save a Hamlin, ever since
                        Walter’s great‐uncle Mordaunt went to the bad, even worse than poor
                        Arnold.”</p>
                    <p>“Some of them,” she said after a moment, “are good, and some are bad: my
                        brother‐in‐law was bad—Arnold was good, and Walter is good; but they are all
                        as weak as water, these Hamlins—weak in goodness or badness, every one of
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>Anne sighed. And as she walked through the big, stately rooms of Wotton
                        House, she thought of the horrible scenes which had happened in there; of
                        the waste of life by violence and vice and neglect which they had witnessed;
                        especially of that wretched, vicious child, held so terribly responsible for
                        the folly and wickedness of others. And the sense of the terrible power of
                        circumstances, of the degradation into which others may lead one, or out of
                        which others may raise one, which had been silently growing in her as she
                        watched the world in her tragic way, came over her with a terrifying
                            rush;<pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7108-119"/> and she felt, half in anxiety at
                        scarcely escaped danger, half in joy at safety, a tumult of gratitude when
                        she remembered how Walter Hamlin had raised her up, led her out of the way
                        of all temptation and evil contact, and left her safe and strong as she knew
                        herself to be.</p>

                    <p>As the summer changed into autumn, the guests at Wotton Hall were gradually
                        renewed. Chough remained, and at Anne’s particular desire sent for his two
                        little girls, sad, strange, Cockney creatures, to whom the large house, the
                        garden, the country walks and country sights, were as things of another
                        world. But the Spencers, Dennistoun, and O’Reilly departed; and in their
                        place arrived the two Leigh girls and Edmund Lewis. The last‐named gentleman
                        did not by any means strike Anne as a fascinating being. He was a stumpy,
                        high‐shouldered, thick‐set little man, always very slackly dressed, with
                        small, rather handsome features, and a profusion of curly reddish hair and
                        beard, which made his face<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7108-121"/> look even more
                        like unbaked dough than it might otherwise have done. Some people considered
                        him very handsome, and it was obvious that he himself felt as if he were
                        tall; for he stumped and slouched in and out of rooms with his hands in his
                        pockets, and dropped on to chairs and sofas with the heavy importance of
                        gait of a Hercules. Nothing could be more comic than the contrast between
                        this lumbering and solemn redhaired dwarf and Cosmo Chough, black, fierce,
                        alert, courteous, and grandiloquent. Lewis was silent; but when he spoke he
                        fixed his handsome eyes searchingly upon one, and either trailed his voice
                        along with slow emphasis, or answered in monosyllables, which left in you an
                        uncomfortable feeling of having made some inappropriate or impertinent
                        remark. He had, moreover, lips of the colour of the very best sealing‐wax; a
                        peculiarity which, while decidedly adding to the pictorial value of a
                        red‐haired man, has a something quite particularly repulsive to certain
                        people, among<pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7108-122"/> whom Anne Brown must be
                        counted. However, she tried to like Mr Lewis. In some respects he was a more
                        genuine personality than Chough, or Dennistoun, or almost any other of
                        Hamlin’s æsthetic friends. He did not make himself up—manner, appearance,
                        ideas, or words—to look like anything which he was not, or at all events
                        which he did not thoroughly believe himself to be; and he was, moreover,
                        much more in the way of will and definite tendencies, and felt himself
                        (however mistakenly) to be much more in the way of power, character, and
                        importance, than any other man whom Anne had ever come across, except her
                        cousin Richard, between whom and Edmund Lewis there existed, despite a
                        thousand differences, a certain resemblance. And perhaps it was exactly this
                        resemblance to Richard Brown,—a man whom Anne did not exactly like, nay, who
                        even occasionally repelled her a little, but of whose power and truthfulness
                        and generosity Anne could not doubt,—perhaps it was this resemblance, however<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7108-123"/> vague it might be, which made Anne for some time believe that
                        Edmund Lewis, little as he pleased her, might be a remarkable sort of man,
                        and treat Chough’s insinuations against him as merely another instance of
                        that childish unreasonableness of likings and dislikings, which, together
                        with vanity and weakness of will, she had got to associate with a poetic
                        endowment. Over Hamlin, at all events, Edmund Lewis had an undeniable
                        influence; an influence which he himself avowedly attributed to his magnetic
                        powers, which he would exert, or imagine that he exerted, sitting lazily
                        opposite his friends or victims, staring vaguely at them and speaking in his
                        slow, important voice. He was a painter, in an irregular sort of way,
                        himself, and took much more interest in Hamlin’s art than in his poetry; so
                        that Hamlin, who was sick of versifying for the moment, had a fit of
                        painting once more, and spent hours locked up in his studio with Lewis,
                        while poor Cosmo Chough was more and more thrown upon Anne and her
                            friends.<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7108-124"/> But the girls had got to
                        understand Chough, and the fund of kindness and self‐sacrificing gentleness
                        which was hidden beneath the little man’s poetical thin‐skinnedness and the
                        queer poetical veneer of mystic wickedness which he himself did not
                        understand. He could not by any possibility be broken of his tendency to
                        talk overmuch about Messalina, Lucretia Borgia, and La Belle Heaulmière; but
                        by this time it was quite obvious that he had not the smallest experience of
                        ladies of any such character, still less the faintest thought of giving
                        offence by his allusions to them. To Anne he was utterly devoted: he was
                        fascinated by her beauty, afraid of its tragic earnestness, afraid of her
                        downright, quiet manner, afraid of her silent contemptuousness, of her
                        uncompromising censoriousness; but if ever a person appreciated Anne’s
                        kindness, her energy, her imperious desire of helping others, it was Chough.
                        Anne had often spoken to him about the neglected education of his little
                        girls; not reproachfully, for she knew but too well on<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7108-125"/> what it depended, but trying to stir him up to
                        resist the sort of fatality which seemed to hang over his family concerns.
                        And now she insisted on taking the children’s education into her own hands,
                        until Chough should be able to afford sending them to a proper school.
                        Perhaps the thought of that neglected, unconsciously corrupted, terribly
                        responsible little heathen girl, who had done so much mischief in Wotton
                        Hall fifteen years before, had something to do with Anne’s energetic
                        behaviour towards the little Choughs—to whom, every morning regularly, she
                        gave a two hours’ lesson in grammar and writing and history, as complete as
                        if she had been a schoolmistress and they her pupils; until their father,
                        astonished at their unexpected development of human faculties, took it in
                        his head to turn them into first‐rate musicians, and actually got up at six
                        in the morning to teach them the piano, while Hamlin and Lewis were still
                        asleep.</p>
                    <p>Marjory Leigh, who had considered Anne<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7108-126"/> in
                        the light of an irresponsible but decidedly objectionable æsthetic villain
                        on her departure from London, looked on in puzzled amazement. She could not
                        understand how any one so beautiful, so versed in useless literature and
                        useless art, any one whom her foolish elder sister foolishly adored, could
                        be anxious and able to make herself of use in the world. And even Mary
                        Leigh, in her gentle, ironical way, was astonished at Anne’s new vocation,
                        and adored her all the more enthusiastically for it. Mrs Macgregor hinted,
                        in her affectionate cynical manner, that Anne was mistaking for a desire to
                        be useful to Chough’s children the mere imperious necessity of caring for
                        some one, which was the vicarious form of love; and prophesied archly that,
                        once married, Anne would soon be satisfied with uselessness. Anne smiled
                        contemptuously at Mrs Macgregor’s theories. Yet she was as unaware as was
                        Mrs Macgregor herself, that there was indeed an imperious necessity in her
                        nature—a necessity more personal, more selfish, and more<pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7108-127"/> terrible than her mere desire to be of use. In
                        these four months Anne had gradually, and hitherto unconsciously, ceased to
                        love Hamlin as she had formerly loved him. Like many of the most powerful
                        and passionate natures, Anne had a fatal tendency to love ideally and love
                        the ideal; not so much to invest with unreal qualities the object of her
                        passion, but to conceive a passion for an impersonal creation of her own, an
                        amalgamation of her own ardent and confused aspirations after an unknown
                        excellence; and then to identify the object of this strange intellectual and
                        moral passion with the first real person who struck her as excellent and
                        noble and beautiful, or who appealed strongly to her sympathies and her
                        gratitude. Of love in the ordinary sense, such a nature is wellnigh
                        incapable; and the devotion due to real imperfect creatures, pity and
                        sympathy with weakness, the devotion due to a sense of duty, although it may
                        be intense and tender in such people, comes only on later, when the first<pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7108-128"/> splendid idol has been shattered, and
                        whatever passion there is must be given, in humbleness or sorrow, to the
                        unsatisfying realities of this world. With such a nature and such
                        tendencies, Anne had been met, when young, ignorant, and friendless, by an
                        indistinct yet real personality—by Hamlin, who had done for her more than
                        any other man had ever done for a woman; and in this vaguely seen Hamlin,
                        known at first only as a servant knows the brilliant guest of the house, a
                        model the painter to whom she is sitting—and then known at a distance, in
                        letters which were the unreal efflorescence of a poet’s mind,—in this
                        vaguely seen Hamlin, to whom she owed her new life, and who was surrounded
                        by all the beautiful things and ideas which that new life represented, Anne
                        Brown had incarnated the ideal of good and beauty towards which her simple,
                        self‐unconscious, energetic soul so strenuously aspired. Such a love as this
                        must be transformed into something less exalted, or must die out
                        unsatisfied, whatever the person who<pb n="130" xml:id="VAB7108-129"/> feels
                        it or the person with whom it is connected: the real, however excellent, can
                        never satisfy the craving after the ideal; a living individual can never
                        quiet desires which have no individual object, which are mere dumb and
                        violent activities of a too powerful soul. But Anne was not the kind of
                        woman in whom simpler and less exacting instincts, in whom ordinary love,
                        can gradually supplant such an ideal passion; and what was worse, Hamlin was
                        not the man who could substitute for an impossible and unapproachable
                        creature of the imagination, a less perfect, but more appealing, more
                        attaching, more lovable creature of reality.</p>
                    <p>No man that ever breathed could have satisfied cravings which were in reality
                        not after a man, but after a higher life, a more complete activity, a nobler
                        aim; but Hamlin fell short not merely of Anne’s ideal, but also, in many
                        things, even of the reality of Anne herself, and of all she could understand
                        and sympathise with. The ecstatic devotion<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7108-130"/>
                        had speedily given way in her to a more sober kind of admiration and
                        affection; but now, little by little, that also was being invaded,
                        transformed piecemeal here and there, by doubt, contempt, and disgust.
                        Anne’s eyes had gradually opened to the fact that Hamlin was vain,
                        thin‐skinned, professionally jealous, and afraid of the judgment, as he was
                        avid of the praise, of his own inferiors; and that, in the negative line, he
                        was without strong likings, enthusiasms, or aspirations; and the negative
                        qualities affected her more than the positive ones: to her the coldness of
                        Hamlin’s sympathies was more painful than the weakness of his nature.
                        Vaguely and gradually these things had dawned upon Anne; and she could no
                        more deny their existence than she could persuade herself that a grey
                        English autumn day was brilliant as an Italian summer morning. But of late
                        things had happened, like that incident of the suppressed “Ballad of the
                        Fens,” and of the self‐slandering sonnets which Hamlin looked upon with
                            such<pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7108-131"/> complacency, which had given her
                        glimpses into something worse than she could well believe in, worse than she
                        had the heart to look into. These she cast behind her, thinking of them as
                        little as possible, trying to consider them as hallucinations, or at all
                        events, gross exaggerations of her own: she must have misunderstood; such
                        things could not be. She tried to settle her love of Hamlin on a real and
                        more solid basis. She fully admitted to herself that Hamlin had
                        weaknesses,—the weaknesses which she remarked in so many of the men around
                        him,—weaknesses going together with the fine qualities of the poet’s
                        nature,—weaknesses which, Anne was beginning to suspect, every one had
                        (forgetting that she had not), or at least something equivalent thereunto.
                        She admitted to herself that Hamlin was weak; nay, to do so was a sort of
                        relief. That Hamlin should come of a family infirm of will and often
                        vicious, that he should have been brought up surrounded by vice and violence
                        engendered by weakness; this notion,<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7108-132"/> due
                        partly to her own observations, and confirmed by Mrs Macgregor’s
                        confidences, explained so much away, and left room for so much: it explained
                        all the wretched part of his nature, it left room for all the good, for the
                        gentleness, the generosity, the chivalric spirit which had made Anne what
                        she was; and it let her hope, every now and then, that better might be in
                        store. For since the evil was merely negative and the good so thorough and
                        so positive, surely the good would vanquish the evil. And, looking at the
                        people who surrounded Hamlin,—at these vain, weak, unreal poets and artists,
                        at this whole school of people who, whatever their private life, affected to
                        live only for selfish enjoyment of beauty and selfish interest in sin,—Anne
                        used often to think that Hamlin was in the position of a sort of Rinaldo,
                        the noblest of all heroes, degraded into mean sloth by the Armida of
                        æstheticism, but requiring only the shrill of the trumpet and the clash of
                        arms from the real living world to be redeemed and to show<pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7108-133"/> himself in his real nobility. She would even
                        exaggerate her aversion or contempt for Hamlin’s companions and for his
                        school; the worse they were, the more excuse for him; and she would often
                        sit dreaming of the way in which he might be gradually got from under their
                        influence, and brought in contact with those stronger, more healthy, or more
                        terrible realities, which Anne’s nature, by a kind of occult sympathy, felt
                        in the world all round, as the birds and insects will feel the storm which
                        is still invisible beyond the hills, but which is coming to purify, and
                        shake, and revive.</p>
                    <p>And so Anne went on loving and hoping, and believing herself to be happy. But
                        there began to be a strange restlessness about her; a desire to be useful,
                        to be perpetually active in something, to be always trying to understand,
                        and sympathise, and help—an imperious necessity not to be left to her own
                        thoughts (those thoughts which had once been like a <pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7108-134"/> paradise, in which solitude was the highest
                        bliss). For, alone with her own thoughts, Anne was beginning to experience
                        an intolerable sense of isolation, and intolerable sense of impotence.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>IN</hi> this condition of mind Anne was violently impelled towards the
                        two Leigh girls; and strongly induced to take an aversion to Edmund Lewis.
                        For the Leighs represented every day more and more the influence which was
                        strengthening her, the influence which might revive Hamlin; and Edmund Lewis
                        seemed sent as an incarnation of those tendencies which, in her belief, had
                        marred the nobility of Hamlin’s nature.</p>
                    <p>Anne’s unmistakable desire to know what was going on in the striving and
                        suffering world outside the strongholds of æstheticism, to help in it to her
                        utmost; to be, what the people believing only in beauty and passion could
                        not conceive, responsible,—all this intense<pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7108-136"/> striving got the better of Marjory Leigh’s prejudices. She began to
                        understand that she had found in Anne a zealous lieutenant; nay, after some
                        time, the conscientious though somewhat pig‐headed and conceited young
                        philanthropist admitted to herself that Anne was a force for work and good
                        which dragged even her along, making her, by the influence of her complete
                        unselfishness, self‐unconsciousness, and energy, more ready to examine into
                        her own mode of doing things, to sift her vanity from her
                        humanitarianism.</p>
                    <p>“Anne does make one less conceited,” Marjory one day remarked to her sister,
                        waking up from a long reverie—“less conceited and less narrow, I do believe.
                        It’s such a revelation; and somehow it makes one feel just a little bit
                        ashamed, to find such honesty and determination in an æsthete. After that,
                        people don’t seem to be so hopelessly lost—do they? I fear I must have been
                        a rather bigoted sort of brute formerly,” and Marjory pushed her fingers
                        through her short, lank<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7108-137"/> yellow hair, and
                        looked up at her sister with her childish, resolute, defiant face, not yet
                        puzzled by the sad experience of the difficulty of doing good, and of the
                        dangerousness of even the wisest theories. Mary Leigh smiled. She was proud
                        of her little sister; and she was, in a sort of a way, in love with Anne
                        Brown. Marjory thought her rather æsthetic and spiritless, she knew; and
                        Anne was absorbed in her own thoughts; but Mary Leigh was one of those girls
                        who can resign themselves cheerfully to being second best, as long as they
                        are the best in their power—to be happy in her devotion, even if it be
                        unreciprocated; and she was happy, in a subdued way—proud of Marjory and
                        adoring Anne, and seeing that the two somewhat unresponsive objects of her
                        love could now appreciate one another.</p>
                    <p>So much for the Leighs. But if their presence at Wotton was a support and a
                        consolation to Anne, the presence of Edmund Lewis very soon grew to be a
                        positive source of disgust<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7108-138"/>. At first, in his egotistic, silently brow‐beating way, he was an
                        interesting visitor. He had travelled and read a good deal, and, in point of
                        fact, knew much more about literature than about his own art. His
                        imagination turned easily to the terrible; he considered Webster as greater
                        than Shakespeare, and Ford as greater than Webster; he had personal
                        experiences of more or less criminal persons, whose acquaintance, for the
                        sake of morbid psychology, he had sought, and whose characteristics he had
                        lovingly studied; while in reality mild and even milk‐soppish in his habits,
                        he seemed to experience a fascination from violence and bloodshed. For a
                        week or so he was decidedly interesting, if not, to Anne and her two
                        girl‐friends, attractive. But hostility soon arose. He was a fervid
                        spiritualist, and a great adept in mesmerising; his vanity made him see
                        mediums, victims of his will‐power, everywhere. He immediately discovered
                        one in Anne, and begged to be permitted to try his tricks, as Marjory Leigh
                        called them.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7108-139"/>
                    <p>Now, if there was one thing which was more abhorrent to Anne than any other,
                        it was spiritualism: averse to mysticism like every Italian; prosaic and
                        common‐sense, perhaps just in proportion to the idealism of passion and
                        aspiration, she was impatient of the vulgar mysteriousness of modern magic;
                        while at the same time her powerful personality, her austere will (which she
                        always recognised as the most precious part of her nature), which took
                        umbrage at Mrs Macgregor’s theories of obedience to mere physical passions,
                        was positively insulted by the notion of surrender to the perfectly
                        unintellectual will of another. However, she let Lewis try. During his
                        performance, as he fixed his green eyes upon her, and made passes with his
                        flabby white fingers, Anne felt a loathing as if a slug were trailing over
                        her, but she sat unaffected by Mr Lewis’s will‐power, and at last wearied
                        out his patience.</p>
                    <p>“You resisted!—I felt you resist!” cried Lewis angrily, at the end of the
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>.</p>
                    <pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7108-140"/>
                    <p>“There was nothing to resist against,” answered Anne, bluntly; “but had there
                        been, of course I should have resisted.”</p>
                    <p>“Hamlin does not resist,” replied Lewis, with a certain malignant pride. “I
                        can do just whatever I choose with Hamlin.”</p>
                    <p>“I enjoy it,” explained Hamlin; “it’s like the first effects of opium or
                        haschisch. One feels one’s self giving way, one’s soul sinking
                        deliciously.”</p>
                    <p>“Going to sleep, in fact,” corrected Anne.</p>
                    <p>From that moment Anne felt that Lewis hated her. Yet he was, in a way,
                        fascinated by her exotic beauty; he could not make up his mind that so
                        strange and splendid a woman could resist him. He never tried to magnetise
                        her again; and he made many drawings of her, curiously distorting her
                        expression, sullen, but frank and resolute, into a kind of sombre, morbid
                        wistfulness.</p>
                    <p>“I hate those sketches he does of you,” cried Marjory one day; “nasty things,
                        which make you look—I don’t know to express it—<pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7108-141"/> as if you were neither a man nor a woman, and
                        were in love with <emph>him</emph>.”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh laughed. “The school is running to seed,” she said: “the great men
                        have done all that could be done in the way of beautiful suggestiveness—the
                        little ones can only do suggestiveness of all sorts of vague nastiness which
                        they don’t even understand. But there’s a change coming on in painting;
                        people are beginning to be satisfied with interpreting real nature;
                        and—don’t you think—Anne—a similar change . . .”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh, who was the most absent‐minded of Irish enthusiasts, suddenly
                        stopped short. She had only just remembered that Hamlin was a poet and a
                        painter of the school which she had just described. And a pained, darkened
                        look had come over Anne. Mary Leigh could not understand that that look
                        meant that Anne had often thought just the same thing, and that now there
                        returned to her, with sickening bitterness, the double<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7108-142"/> recollection of the “Ballad of the Fens,” and of
                        those twelve sonnets called “Desire.”</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Anne gradually got substantial reasons for her instinctive aversion
                        to Edmund Lewis. The family of the vicar of Wotton sometimes visited at the
                        Hall. There were two very young girls, scarcely more than children, for whom
                        Anne and the Leighs had taken a fancy. One afternoon they came to tea,
                        delicate pink‐and‐white creatures of fourteen or fifteen, impressionable,
                        nervous, utterly ignorant of the world. Hamlin seemed to appreciate the
                        charm of obvious purity and guilelessness which went with their ignorance of
                        the world.</p>
                    <p>“I should like to make a picture of those two creatures,” he whispered to
                        Anne, as they sat at tea in the library, “or to write a poem about them—they
                        seem to do one good; for it is good, is it not, to see so much life which is
                        so perfectly fresh, and unsullied, and untormented—such a desire to know the
                        world before<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7108-143"/> the evil in it is even guessed at—don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p>Even Chough could not make a single unintelligible allusion to the wife of
                        Claudius or the daughter of Alexander VI., but sat with one of his children
                        on his knee, looking at the young girls and gently humming a scrap of old
                        minuet, fresh and simple like themselves. Anne could not help thinking that
                        she had never been what these girls were. She had been shown the ugly things
                        of life, taught to struggle with them since her childhood, and now believing
                        equally in good, but believing sadly and bitterly. It was better to be a
                        woman as she was, a woman who knew of good and evil, and was prepared to
                        fight her way out of darkness; but still it was sad never, never to have
                        been as these girls. Edmund Lewis was leaning forward on the table, his
                        reddish‐auburn head with its glittering eyes rising like that of a snake, as
                        if silently trying to mesmerise the visitors.</p>
                    <p>“Suppose we show these young ladies some of our works of art?” he proposed,
                        in a half‐<pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7108-144"/> jocular way which he
                        occasionally had. The girls had never seen any pictures scarcely, and having
                        heard of Hamlin and Lewis as famous painters from London, were delighted.
                        The whole party went up to Hamlin’s studio. He showed the girls not the
                        things for which he cared most, but what he thought would give them most
                        pleasure—magnificent tinted sketches of poetical legends, of the Sleeping
                        Beauty, Cupid and Psyche, and so forth. Anne thought she had scarcely ever
                        seen Hamlin so nice before as when he got the sketches out of the portfolio,
                        and told the girls what they represented. When he had done, Edmund Lewis,
                        with his slow, shuffling movements, placed his large sketch‐book on an
                        easel, and turned a page. It was covered with outline drawings of men and
                        women, stark naked, in various listless attitudes.</p>
                    <p>Anne had seen these drawings time after time, and had thought them,
                        accustomed as she was to studios and painters, merely clever nude studies,
                        with the usual expression of<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7108-145"/> bored
                        depravity of all Lewis’s work. She had criticised the drawing and anatomy,
                        and had never before thought that any impropriety was connected with them.
                        But now she could not help blushing and feeling vaguely indignant.</p>
                    <p>“That’s not the sort of thing to show those children,” whispered Mary Leigh,
                        who, heaven knows, had seen nude studies enough in her life. Both she and
                        Anne had caught the surprised, vacant expression of the two girls, had seen
                        the flush in their face, and understood the silence, never asking what it
                        all meant, as they stared at all this emaciated, flabby nakedness. And Anne
                        caught also Edmund Lewis’s expression, as he held the corner of the page,
                        ready to turn over, with one hand, stroking his reddish‐brown beard with the
                        other, and looking, with slightly raised eyebrows and curious green eyes,
                        towards Hamlin, as if to call his attention. Lewis turned another page, and
                        another; always the same stark‐naked people. Anne was very black. Heaven
                        knows from what instinct, perhaps from a paternal recollection<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7108-146"/> of his own little girls, Cosmo Chough understood Anne’s look; and
                        edging himself awkwardly into the corner, he banged against the easel, and
                        made it and the sketch‐hook come down with a crash.</p>
                    <p>“Confound your awkwardness!” cried Lewis, stooping to pick up his drawings,
                        and slowly replacing the sketch‐book.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think they care to see any more,” said Anne; “you see, these young
                        ladies haven’t studied anatomy. Supposing you show them your Eastern
                        sketches, Mr Lewis.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis gave Anne a rapid, angry glance. “The Eastern sketches are up‐stairs,”
                        he said snappishly; adding, in his drawling, mock courteous way, “I think
                        these young ladies have seen the best I could show them.”</p>
                    <p>“Then we had better go down‐stairs, and Mr Chough will play an accompaniment,
                        for I know they sing very nicely,” said Anne, taking no notice of him.</p>
                    <p>Perhaps, thought Anne, she might have been prejudiced against Edmund Lewis.
                            He<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7108-147"/> did draw morbid‐looking nudities;
                        but so many other men did just the same, that it was quite possible he might
                        have displayed that sketch‐book from mere thoughtlessness. Yet she could not
                        believe it; she had seen Lewis’s look as he turned over the pages, and that
                        look had disgusted her.</p>
                    <p>The next day but one the question was settled in her mind. It was a fine
                        autumn morning, and Anne was seated on the terrace, waiting for the others
                        to come down to breakfast. The air, just touched by the first cold, was
                        exquisitely pure; and the sear bracken of the hillside opposite sparkled
                        golden with the heavy dew. All round the swallows were whirring about,
                        collecting for departure. The thought of the Villa Arnolfini—of the place in
                        the vineyard, among the yellowing vines, where she used to sit on the dry
                        warm mint and fennel with the little Perrys, where, under the big
                        mulberry‐tree, they had buried her Dante in a heap of yellow leaves—came
                        home to Anne. How good Hamlin had been to<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7108-148"/>
                        her! the idea almost pained her. But this lovely morning seemed to have
                        swept all evil away. If only, Anne said to herself, Hamlin’s sympathies
                        could be violently roused—if only he could be awakened suddenly, by some
                        unexpected contact with the tragic realities of the world, by a sudden
                        appeal to his generosity and indignation, out of this æsthetic day‐dream
                        with its enervating visions of impure beauty and forbidden things. If only
                        this could be done, the horrid spell which kept him at a moral distance from
                        her would be broken through. . . . And soon it must come, this
                        awakening.</p>
                    <p>As she was thinking in this way, Edmund Lewis strolled up, his hands behind
                        his back, to the table at which she was seated. He gave her a little
                        unceremonious nod, and then, interrupting the tune which he was faintly
                        whistling, pushed a paper‐bound book across the table to her.</p>
                    <p>“Have you ever read this, Miss Brown?” he asked; “do you know that passage?
                            I<pb n="150" xml:id="VAB7108-149"/> think it one of the loveliest things
                        which have ever been written.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s eye glanced at the page, pencil‐marked all round, and then at the
                        title on the margin. It was Gautier’s ‘Mademoiselle de Maupin.’ She
                        understood.</p>
                    <p>“I have never read it,” she answered, “but I have often heard that it is a
                        book which a man does not offer a woman except as an insult,” and she
                        quietly handed the volume back, looking up, her beautiful severe face
                        flushed, her slate‐grey eyes flashing, at Lewis.</p>
                    <p>The painter started.</p>
                    <p>“Upon my word,” he answered quickly, with his usual self‐possession, “I never
                        thought that. I never thought that any book could possibly offend a pure
                        woman nowadays. I regard this book merely as a noble hymn to beauty; others
                        may regard it otherwise. I really had no thought of offending you, my dear
                        Miss Brown”—there was a tone of patronising insolence in his voice.</p>
                    <p>“So much the better,” answered Anne, rising.</p>
                    <pb n="151" xml:id="VAB7108-150"/>
                    <p>Oh how, how could Hamlin, with his chivalrous nature, endure the daily
                        contact of such a man as this!</p>
                    <p>“Lewis ought not to have selected those particular drawings to show the
                        vicar’s girls,” said Anne, later on. She could not allude to that scene of
                        the book; but she felt she must say something. “A man ought not to show such
                        things as those to mere children, brought up in the country, who don’t know
                        what they mean, and are merely shocked by such things—don’t you think so,
                        Mary?”</p>
                    <p>“Certainly,” answered Mary Leigh boldly, quite astonished at Anne’s venturing
                        to mention such a subject.</p>
                    <p>“It wasn’t good taste, certainly,” answered Hamlin. “Lewis is fearfully
                        absent‐minded. They are lovely designs. But still, it wasn’t good taste, I
                        quite agree.”</p>
                    <p>“Good taste!” thought Anne, with a shudder. “Is there nothing higher than
                        taste in the world?”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                    <p><hi>THREE</hi> days later, Chough and Lewis returned to town, and Hamlin went
                        with them. The weather had broken up, and it was time to settle for the
                        winter. Aunt Claudia and Anne were to stay on another fortnight, in order to
                        give Hamlin time to make some alterations in the house at Hammersmith. Such
                        at least was the pretext; but Anne knew that Madame Elaguine had arrived in
                        London, and she guessed that Hamlin would wish to transact whatever business
                        there might be, before exposing to Mrs Macgregor’s wrath the Cousin Sacha of
                        former days—before, perhaps, refusing to let Anne Brown meet a woman whose
                        past spoke little in her favour, and of whose present he knew absolutely
                        nothing.</p>
                    <pb n="153" xml:id="VAB7108-152"/>
                    <p>“How I dread seeing that woman!” he exclaimed the evening before his
                        departure, as he walked up and down the hall with Anne, while the rest of
                        the company was listening to Cosmo Chough, shrilly piping eighteenth century
                        music in the drawing‐room.</p>
                    <p>“Has Aunt Claudia ever told you anything of our life when Cousin Sacha was
                        here with us, years ago?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>Anne nodded.</p>
                    <p>“Aunt Claudia told me the whole story.”</p>
                    <p>“Then you can understand,” cried Hamlin, almost convulsively, “how the mere
                        thought of Sacha is loathsome to me; and yet, I must behave decently towards
                        her—don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p>“Of course you must; and I can’t help thinking that perhaps—well, that your
                        aunt and you may be a little unjust towards her—I don’t think that a child
                        really could be so bad.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, a child may be as bad as a woman if she have evil blood in her! and just
                        think, if<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7108-153"/> Sacha was like that as a child,
                        what must she not be as a woman?”</p>
                    <p>There was something odd in his tone; something not of indignation, but of a
                        kind of clinging curiosity.</p>
                    <p>“I daresay,” said Anne, “that as a woman she may be much better than as a
                        child. Her eyes may have been opened to her own unworthiness, and she may
                        have struggled out of the influence of bad examples. I am sure many, many
                        people are much better as men and women than as children. To know, to feel
                        responsible, means so much.”</p>
                    <p>“That may be.” There was some disappointment in Hamlin’s tone.</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed.</p>
                    <p>“You want to find a fiend, a lamia, a vampire,” she said—“something hateful
                        and picturesque. Fancy if your cousin should turn out a most prosaic and
                        ultra‐respectable woman, given up to her children, and coffee‐taverns, and
                        women’s suffrage!”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin could not help laughing.</p>
                    <pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7108-154"/>
                    <p>“I fear there’s not much chance of that. Anyhow, I must see whether she is
                        fit for you to receive, and whether Aunt Claudia can be mollified towards
                        her, supposing she is the exemplary piece of prose which you imagine.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had induced Cosmo Chough to leave his little girls in her charge; and
                        the Leighs were to return to London with her and Aunt Claudia. The big house
                        seemed very empty without Hamlin and his friends; but the quiet was
                        pleasant. Somehow, when he was away, when she could no longer see him
                        perpetually sitting and walking with Edmund Lewis, Anne’s love for Hamlin
                        became much stronger. In her recollection he existed only with reference to
                        herself; she felt his goodness, she believed in his nobility, she felt sure
                        that some day he would become more manly, healthy, and resolute. If only she
                        could enter into his confidence, instead of men like Lewis and Dennistoun;
                        if only she could make him see all that there was in the world besides mere
                        art and poetry. Perhaps she was unworthy to<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7108-155"/> do it. This thought spurred her on, redoubled Anne’s restless desire to
                        know, to sympathise, and to help.</p>
                    <p>Marjory Leigh had, soon after her arrival at Wotton, made acquaintance with
                        the wife of the vicar, a simple, energetic, rather narrow‐minded but
                        boundlessly unselfish woman, all whose thoughts were given to improving the
                        condition of the neighbouring poor. To tell the whole truth, the vicar had a
                        son, a young man entirely belying the usual saying about clergymen’s sons,
                        who had renounced a good living in the neighbourhood in order to become a
                        curate in the East End of London.</p>
                    <p>Harry Collett had been at Oxford at the same time as Hamlin; he had even, for
                        some time, belonged to the æsthetic set of which Hamlin and Melton Perry had
                        been the heads: but he had soon become a religious enthusiast; and, his
                        religious enthusiasm cooling down, he had remained an ardent philanthropist.
                        Hamlin had a liking for Harry Collett. He was handsome, tall, and emaciated,
                        like a St John<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7108-156"/> the Baptist by Donatello;
                        he was in his own style poetical; he was a dreamer and an enthusiast. Hamlin
                        used to call him Francis of Assisi. He did several sketches of him, and
                        asked him several times to Wotton Hall. Anne also liked and admired him; but
                        there was something exaggerated, narrow‐minded, in him, which shocked her
                        Italian temperament. What she wanted was secular energy, not priestly
                        devotion.</p>
                    <p>“He is a monk,” she used to say; “he ought to have lived in the middle ages.
                        What we want nowadays are disagreeable, rough‐and‐ready men like Cousin
                        Dick—men who don’t merely feel sorry for vice, but who try to understand its
                        scientific reason.”</p>
                    <p>Marjory Leigh, who declared herself to belong to the most advanced of all
                        advanced parties, and to whom Richard Brown was little less than a god,
                        perfectly agreed in Anne’s verdict. But being of a proselytising temper, and
                        having a special love for proselytising among the young men of her
                        acquaintance, she immediately<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7108-157"/> set about enlightening the rather High Church benevolence of Harry
                        Collett, as soon as he came to spend at Wotton his summer holidays. Anne and
                        Mary Leigh used often to laugh over the intensely serious flirtations which
                        were carried on between Marjory and the East End curate—flirtations of which
                        both parties were perfectly unaware—earnestly discussing charity
                        reorganisation, ventilation, primary instruction, and so forth; but which
                        was nevertheless destined to result, soon after the general return to town,
                        in a long engagement between Marjory and Harry Collett. Harry was already
                        back at his post in the East End; but Marjory, being unable to discuss
                        philanthropy with him, went daily to help his mother in her work. Thus it
                        was that Anne gradually became acquainted with the petty miseries of village
                        life, its dull indifference, mistaken by poets for innocence, and beneath
                        which lies so much possibility of stupid misery and stupid crime. “All that
                        must be improved some day,” Anne used to say; and<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7108-158"/> she determined to ask Cousin Dick’s advice, for
                        she believed in radical measures rather than in the small palliations of the
                        vicar’s wife.</p>
                    <p>One afternoon—they were within three or four days of return to London—Marjory
                        Leigh returned more than usually excited from a visit to the vicarage.</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” asked Anne, as the three girls sat alone in Hamlin’s
                        empty studio.</p>
                    <p>Marjory threw her hat on the floor. “Give me some tea,” she said, “I feel
                        quite sick; I never thought I should come across such horrors. Of course,”
                        she added quickly, before Anne or her sister had time to exclaim, and as if
                        to reclaim her reputation for omniscience—“of course I knew that such things
                        existed—oh dear, yes—in big towns and so forth; but still,”—and poor Marjory
                        fairly burst into tears,—“I never, never thought that—I should come so near
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>Finally, when she had had some tea, Marjory, all blushing and stammering, and
                        in a<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7108-159"/> hesitating, roundabout way, which
                        curiously belied her usual affectation of cynical omniscience, proceeded to
                        explain what had just happened. A girl with an illegitimate baby—a very
                        common occurrence in those parts—had turned up for assistance at the
                        vicarage, and, while deprecating the wretched creature’s fault, the vicar’s
                        wife had revealed to Marjory Leigh a jealously hidden stain in her parish;
                        namely, that in the hamlet to which the girl belonged, a mishap, as she
                        termed it, like hers was a trifle, and indeed could scarcely be considered a
                        fault at all, compared with the condition of brutish sin in which rolled,
                        cynically huddled together in cabins no better than sties, the whole small
                        population of that foul little fen village.</p>
                    <p>“It appears it’s been going on for generations,” cried Marjory, “and that
                        there’s no hope of remedying things unless the miserable creatures be
                        removed into more decent dwellings. It’s useless trying to teach them to
                        live decently as long as they live there, in<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7108-160"/> those hovels in the fen, where half of them are ill of fever every
                        autumn, and they herd together like cattle. Oh, it’s sickening to think of
                        Christian people being so sinful close by one!” and Marjory burst into
                        hysterical sobs.</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh had exclaimed in horror as soon as Marjory’s meaning had become
                        plain to her.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don’t cry, don’t cry, Marjory darling!” she exclaimed, throwing herself
                        on her knees and clasping her sister’s waist. “<emph>You</emph> can’t do
                        anything, my love—and you’ll only make yourself ill if you let yourself
                        brood on such things.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had not exclaimed. She sat perfectly still, and said nothing. Most
                        persons would have deemed her very callous, she looked so calm.</p>
                    <p>“Are you quite sure, Marjory,” she asked, after a minute—“are you quite sure
                        you did not misunderstand, or that Mrs Collett did not exaggerate?”</p>
                    <pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7108-161"/>
                    <p>“I couldn’t misunderstand; and Mrs Collett gave me ever so many details—such
                        dreadful details;” and interrupted by her sobs, Marjory repeated scraps of
                        what she had heard.</p>
                    <p>“Where is the place?” asked Anne, after another pause.</p>
                    <p>“It’s that cluster of houses half‐way to Eggleston, in the middle of the fen,
                        by the river—they call it Cold Fremley. Don’t you remember our going down
                        there once in the break, with the Spencers and Chough, and your saying you
                        wished Hamlin would paint that sort of fiat green country, and Mrs Spencer
                        saying it was unpoetical?”</p>
                    <p>Anne remembered. The recollection of that moment came like a vision; she saw
                        the wide river, between its low sedgy banks of boggy green; the reddish
                        storm sunset reflected in clotted flame‐coloured masses in its thick grey
                        waters; the moon rising, a spectral crescent on the blue evening sky; she
                        heard the quail of the frogs, the cries of the water‐fowl: the Spencers and
                        Chough on ahead with the two<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7108-162"/> Leighs and
                        Harry Collett; and she and Hamlin lingering behind, watching the reddened
                        stream—and the cattle, dark outlines on the flat green banks opposite;
                        Hamlin scrambling down the bank to get a tuft of willow herb growing half in
                        the water. She was feeling so happy; Hamlin was so good and gentle and
                        handsome, and she loved him so; and they two had stood by the river alone,
                        until the little Spencer children had run back and taken her hand, and begun
                        asking a hundred questions in their shrill baby lisp. It was so lovely and
                        peaceful and good, this green country, this quiet evening, with Hamlin by
                        her side and the children holding her hand. She had felt a painful longing
                        to impress the place and the moment on her mind, to keep this happy present.
                        “What is this called?” she had asked; and Hamlin had answered “Cold
                        Fremley.” Cold Fremley! Anne went on repeating to herself all that
                        afternoon: the recollection of that beautiful scene, become hideous like a
                            nightmare,<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7108-163"/> haunted her. The huddled
                        roofs dark in the distance, the curl of smoke—that was the place. Anne felt
                        dizzy. She had read enough about shame and sin, heaven knows; the poems of
                        the poets of the set were full of allusions to such things. But she had
                        never realised that they could be realities; they had been so many artistic
                        dabs of horror, imaginary, or belonging vaguely to some distant, dim world,
                        as unreal as the beautiful haunted woods and mysterious castles, the pale
                        unsubstantial gods and heroes, and men and women of the pictures of Rossetti
                        and Burne Jones, of the poems of Swinburne and Morris, and Hamlin and
                        Chough. But that abominations like these should be here, close at hand, in
                        sordid, filthy reality, reality under this same sun, swept by this same
                        wind, reality through which she had unconsciously walked; this seemed
                        impossible. A strange thing happened: the thought of what she had heard
                        haunted her so persistently, loomed before her in such ever‐changing horror,
                        that Anne at<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7108-164"/> last felt like one drunk or
                        half asleep, and began to doubt whether it was not all a horrible nightmare.
                        Had Marjory really told her these things? Before a court of justice Anne
                        would have been unable to say whether she had or not. It was so unreal to
                        her that she could not accept it as a reality; the more she brooded, the
                        more did it seem a hallucination.</p>
                    <p>“Marjory,” said Anne the next day, suddenly, “is it true that you told me
                        some dreadful things which you had heard from Mrs Collett about the people
                        at Cold Fremley?”</p>
                    <p>Marjory looked up in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>“Of course it is,”—she had half forgotten it herself.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot get it out of my mind,” said Anne, passing her hand over her eyes,
                        as if to disperse some black mist; “it is too horrible. Everything in the
                        world seems tarnished, don’t you know, and a sort of horrible clamminess all
                        round.”</p>
                    <p>Marjory looked at Anne. She was very pale, and her big, greyish‐blue,
                            onyx‐coloured<pb n="166" xml:id="VAB7108-165"/> eyes were wide with a
                        fixed stare. She looked as if she did indeed see the tarnish on the world,
                        and felt the clamminess; as if, like a person taken with some fever, she
                        tasted copper on her tongue.</p>
                    <p>Marjory was a sensible girl. She had studied medicine, and knew an appalling
                        amount about direction of the will, expectant attention, and other
                        psychological and physiological matters. “Anne,” she said, “you are making
                        yourself ill about this matter. Of course you couldn’t help being shocked;
                        but you take it too much to heart. You are going to let these horrible
                        things haunt you; it is a great temptation to do so. Take care; it won’t do
                        any good, and you will merely get quite unstrung. I warn you against it. You
                        mustn’t let such things get the better of your will: it’s morbid, and
                        dangerous, and unworthy,”—and Marjory completely forgot how she herself had
                        entered the room in hysterics the previous day.</p>
                    <p>Anne took no notice of her speech. “You say nothing can be done until these
                        people be<pb n="167" xml:id="VAB7108-166"/> given better dwellings?” she
                        asked, after a pause.</p>
                    <p>Marjory nodded. “So Mrs Collett says, and I’ve read that repeatedly in books
                        also—for, of course, such things have happened elsewhere. At all events, the
                        children might be brought up to live more decently, if they were not all
                        huddled up together like that.”</p>
                    <p>A thought seemed to flash across Anne’s darkened mind. Her maid had just
                        brought in the tea‐things.</p>
                    <p>“Laura,” she asked, “do you know to whom Cold Fremley—those cottages by the
                        river, half‐way to Eggleston—belongs?”</p>
                    <p>“I can ask Mr Hamlin’s steward, miss—he’s just in the housekeeper’s room,”
                        answered Laura.</p>
                    <p>“Run and ask,” ordered Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Good heavens, Anne!” cried Mary Leigh, “what <emph>are</emph> you going to
                        do! You surely aren’t going to talk about such things and try to interfere!
                        What can you do, when Mrs Collett has failed?”</p>
                    <pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7108-167"/>
                    <p>“The houses must be rebuilt,” answered Anne, quietly and firmly; “to
                        whomsoever they belong, they must—they shall be rebuilt.”</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense!” cried practical Marjory; “how can you talk like that? Are you
                        going to apply to the neighbouring squires and tell them about such
                        matters?”</p>
                    <p>“They must rebuild the houses if once they understand,” repeated Anne. “I
                        don’t care to whom they belong—they shall be rebuilt. I will write and speak
                        to every one and any one on the subject, until the thing has been done.”</p>
                    <p>“It’s all very well, but when it comes to the point, you wouldn’t venture to
                        mention such a thing to a man,” cried Marjory,
                        contemptuously—“I—wouldn’t.”</p>
                    <p>At this moment the maid entered.</p>
                    <p>“The steward says that Cold Fremley—those houses by the river,
                        leastways—belong to Mr Hamlin, and as it’s he that lets them out.”</p>
                    <pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7108-168"/>
                    <p>Marjory and her sister looked at each other and then at Anne, as much as to
                        say, “Well, you see now what it would be.” Anne flushed scarlet, but her
                        face brightened.</p>
                    <p>“I will speak to Mr Hamlin,” she said, as soon as the maid’s back was turned.
                        Her voice faltered a little; but it was from sudden surprise, not from
                        hesitation.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Annie, dear, you’ll find that you can’t!” exclaimed Mary Leigh; “you’ll
                        find it impossible.”</p>
                    <p>“At all events, you’ll have to put it through your aunt,” suggested
                        Marjory.</p>
                    <p>“Through Aunt Claudia?” cried Anne. “Do you think she will make him feel it?
                        Why, she will answer that such things are going on all round us, and worse
                        ones. No; I shall speak to Mr Hamlin himself: he is the proprietor of
                        Fremley; and he is responsible.”</p>
                    <p>“You’ll never be able to do so,” insisted Mary; “you think you will, but you
                        can’t. Fancy saying all that to a man—and to a man who is in love with
                        you!”</p>
                    <pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7108-169"/>
                    <p>“What must be done, must be done,” answered Anne. “It’s not a question of
                        liking or disliking. Mr Hamlin’s a man, and I am a woman, and I daresay men
                        and women don’t talk about such things. But Mr Hamlin is the proprietor of
                        Cold Fremley, and that’s all I have to do with.”</p>
                    <p>The Leighs looked at her with incredulous astonishment. It seemed so simple
                        to her.</p>

                    <p><hi>IT</hi> was raining when they arrived in London—a warmish, brown, clammy
                        autumn day. The streets were a porridge of liquid mud, whose trail dragged
                        along the wet asphalt; the houses were staring forth, a livid dirt‐grey, in
                        the thin rain; and the sky, the very rain, was befouled with grime. Only
                        drays splashed through the mud, and carriages carrying hurried‐looking
                        people; children, still in their tattered summer cottons and battered straw
                        hats, stared in at the shops, the broad sheen from whose brilliant windows
                        was caught up by the wet pavement, and lingered out, in broken reflections,
                        in the brown ooze of the thoroughfare. Along the deserted suburban streets
                        every second house seemed to be a<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7108-172"/>
                        gin‐palace, with shining coloured globes, and stucco pinnacles soaked with
                        rain, and ground‐glass windows shining out like a leprosy of white. Mrs
                        Macgregor closed her eyes in disgust. Even the maid looked depressed. But
                        Anne stared out of the window of the carriage at all the hideous soppy
                        sordidness, which seemed to soil and soak black into one’s mind; and she
                        felt glad. All this was reality: it was the world in which lay her
                        redemption, and the redemption of Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Anne found Hamlin full of his cousin Sacha, upon whom he had already called
                        three times, and in whom, to his surprise, he had found not a trace of the
                        child whom he had hated; but a respectable, unworldly young mother, devoted
                        to her children, timid, and only deserving a little sympathy.</p>
                    <p>“She is a very curious woman,” he said, “evidently excellent at bottom; but I
                        don’t know whether I quite like her. She has something very strange about
                        her,—handsome; and at the same time—I don’t know exactly <pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7108-173"/> what it is—charming, but not quite reassuring. I
                        am so anxious for you to see her.”</p>
                    <p>“I am so awfully glad she’s nice,” exclaimed Anne. “Do you know, she weighed
                        upon me like a nightmare after all Aunt Claudia had said. It seemed too
                        horrible that such a creature should exist; and I felt sure it was all
                        prejudice against the poor little thing.”</p>
                    <p>“Don’t be in such a hurry,” laughed Hamlin; “perhaps you won’t like her after
                        all. There is something uncanny about her, decidedly.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m sure that’s all your imagination. You’re always thinking that things are
                        uncanny: it comes of writing too much about proud, pale, evil women, and
                        that sort of nonsense.”</p>
                    <p>Anne felt really glad. That the terrible Cousin Sacha, the fiend‐child of
                        Wotton Hall, should turn out a respectable, unworldly young woman, devoted
                        to her children, seemed to her like the first breaking of the spell which
                        hung over Hamlin. She felt no jealousy of Cousin Sacha; for, as Hamlin spoke
                        of Madame Elaguine, it was obvious that if he was anxious to<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7108-174"/> show her to Anne, he was equally impatient to
                        display his beautiful ward to her, who had evidently been told a great deal
                        about her already.</p>
                    <p>The next day Madame Elaguine was to call on Anne. Mrs Macgregor took the
                        announcement in a spirit of sombre defiance. “She may come,” she said, “but
                        I will not see her. What o’clock is the creature coming?”</p>
                    <p>“Four,” answered Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“Very well; then I’ll order the brougham for half‐past three, and go and make
                        some calls. Anne may stay behind if she likes.”</p>
                    <p>Accordingly, at half‐past three, Mrs Macgregor rolled off in the brougham to
                        Mrs Argiropoulo’s, and to various other people whom she declared she hated.
                        At four o’clock Hamlin came up‐stairs from his studio, and Anne gave him
                        some tea. “She will be here in a minute,” he said.</p>
                    <p>There was a noise of wheels; Anne felt her hand tremble as she poured out a
                        second cup for Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“There! I’ve gone and spilt it on your cuff!<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7108-175"/> Isn’t it idiotic of me to feel flurried about seeing your cousin?”</p>
                    <p>But the wheels passed on. More wheels, which also passed; rings and knocks;
                        but no Madame Elaguine. Hamlin, at every false alarm, got up and looked at
                        Anne—a long, admiring look at her stately figure and her strange pale face,
                        with the overhanging masses of crimp black hair; at the splendid postures,
                        of which only Michelangelo seemed to have ever understood the magnificent
                        weary weightiness into which she naturally fell.</p>
                    <p>“She is evidently not coming,” he said with some irritation, as the clock
                        struck five; “it’s too bad, keeping one in for nothing, like this!”</p>
                    <p>“I didn’t want to go out with Aunt Claudia; and I don’t see how you could
                        have gone on painting after dark.”</p>
                    <p>“Still it is too annoying.”</p>
                    <p>“I daresay it’s not so easy to go paying visits at Hammersmith when one has
                        children to attend to.”</p>
                    <pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7108-176"/>
                    <p>“Bother the children! she might leave them to a nurse.”</p>
                    <p>At that moment a cab stopped, and there came a knock.</p>
                    <p>“That’s she!” cried Hamlin, and he ran down‐stairs.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine entered; in the dusk Anne could scarcely see her face: she
                        was rather below the average height, but so slender that she looked tall;
                        there was something very shy about her, and Anne could understand her
                        shyness.</p>
                    <p>“I am so glad you have come,” she said; “we had almost given you up.”</p>
                    <p>“I fear I am very late—perhaps in your way,” said Madame Elaguine; “the fact
                        is, I had to take my little girl to choose a doll, and she took nearly an
                        hour about it,” and she laughed a little shy laugh. She had a beautiful
                        voice, high and silvery, and yet warm and caressing, like a child’s, which
                        inevitably made you think of delicate green leaves, and fields whitened with
                        budding clover, and all sorts of young and tender things. She<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7108-177"/> was very thin, almost emaciated, and with a
                        slight droop of the head: it was too dark for Anne to see her features
                        distinctly, but she seemed pretty, and frail, and wasted. There was
                        something in that childish voice which touched Anne; her strong, rebellious
                        disbelief in the horrible Sacha of Mrs Macgregor came indignantly to
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“It is very good of you to let me come and see you,” said Madame Elaguine,
                        after some trifling conversation, “and very good of my cousin to propose it;
                        because,” and her voice, in a sudden outburst of frankness, became just a
                        little tremulous, “Walter must have a very painful recollection of me. It
                        was a very unhappy time when we were last together, and I often think with
                        shame of what I was then—what a wretched, badly brought up, bad‐hearted
                        child I was.”</p>
                    <p>“If you had been a bad‐hearted child,” cried Anne, “you could not be what you
                        are now, you could not speak as you do now. I don’t believe it.”</p>
                    <pb n="180" xml:id="VAB7108-178"/>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine sighed.</p>
                    <p>“At all events,” she said, “the question now is no longer what I was or what
                        I am, but what my children are to be. I am played out; I only hope I may
                        live to see them on the road to being happier and more useful creatures than
                        I have been.”</p>
                    <p>There was something in that clear soft voice, with its just perceptible
                        daintiness of Russian pronunciation, making the English words not less
                        English, but more distinct and liquid, which made what from any one else
                        might have seemed strange, quite natural and simple.</p>
                    <p>“You have come to settle in England?” asked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Yes; at least if it is possible for me ever to settle anywhere. I have been
                        a rolling stone so long, or rather such a feather carried hither and thither
                        by the wind, that I can scarcely believe in settling anywhere; and then,
                        perhaps, I may not be permitted to stay where I should be happy. But I want
                        my boy to become an Englishman, and at the<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7108-179"/>
                        same time I haven’t the heart to let him go away from me.”</p>
                    <p>“Why should you not settle?” asked Anne; “surely you will be much happier
                        near your child.”</p>
                    <p>“Why may I never do what I wish?” exclaimed Madame Elaguine, with a curious
                        wildness; “why may I not be left to live in peace like any other
                        insignificant woman, whose life has been a failure? I am not my own
                        mistress.”</p>
                    <p>“Bring lights,” ordered Hamlin, who had summoned the servants. He was
                        impatient that the two women should see each other, impatient to display to
                        his cousin the magnificent creature which belonged to him.</p>
                    <p>They had begun discussing various school‐plans for Madame Elaguine’s children
                        when the lamps were brought in. Anne was surprised when she saw Hamlin’s
                        cousin distinctly; she had imagined her pretty and delicate in an ordinary
                        way, but there was nothing commonplace about this woman. She was pale, and
                        of almost ghastly thinness, and<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7108-180"/> her
                        features, despite her small size, were large, and perhaps a little gaunt. It
                        struck Anne that she had seen a face like that before, and later she
                        discovered that what Madame Elaguine made her think of was Sarah Bernhardt
                        in one of her girlish parts, or as her face looked under the little cap of
                        Coppée’s page‐boy. It was a charming, frank, worn, yet childish face, full
                        of movement,—a face which seemed to vibrate like a delicate instrument—not
                        exactly beautiful nor exactly lovable, but interesting and fascinating. It
                        seemed to Anne that she could perfectly understand the past of this woman: a
                        highly nervous, delicate nature, not earnest but passionate, easily turned
                        into the very best or the very worst; and she felt more than ever indignant
                        at the thought of the corruption in contact with which this mobile
                        impressionable creature had come as a child,—at the thought of all the
                        unintentional shame which this woman must look back upon in her
                        childhood.</p>
                    <p>While they were talking, Sacha Elaguine<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7108-181"/> was
                        equally busy looking at Anne; and Anne puzzled her.</p>
                    <p>“Either a volcano or an iceberg, or both,” said the little Russian to
                        herself, as she looked at Anne’s solemn, unruffled, and yet tragic
                        beauty.</p>
                    <p>At that moment a carriage stopped at the door. Hamlin went to the window. He
                        looked rather pale and puzzled as he came back.</p>
                    <p>“Let me show you my studio, Sacha,” he said hurriedly; “we can get there
                        quickest by a little back‐stair out of the library. Will you come?”</p>
                    <p>Anne understood. Mrs Macgregor, who had gone out expecting Madame Elaguine to
                        come an hour earlier, had returned, and Hamlin dreaded a scene. But Madame
                        Elaguine understood also.</p>
                    <p>“Your aunt has returned,” she said; “yes, I’m sure she has—that’s why you
                        want to hide me away; you are afraid of a scene . . .”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin hesitated; but Madame Elaguine<pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7108-182"/>
                        seemed to pin him down with her rapid glance.</p>
                    <p>“Well, yes,” he said; “what’s the use of mincing matters? You know how
                        unreasonable Aunt Claudia always was, and what a prejudice she had against
                        you.”</p>
                    <p>“And has still; I can believe it. But look here,” and the little emaciated
                        creature rapidly stopped Hamlin as he was raising the curtain into the next
                        room—“I am not going to be hid away. Your aunt has every reason to hate me,
                        and to be angry at finding me here. But I am not coming into her house on
                        the sly—I won’t be hidden away. Your aunt may say what she likes to me, but
                        she shall see me here.”</p>
                    <p>“I think Madame Elaguine is quite right,” said Anne, though she knew full
                        well what sort of reception Mrs Macgregor was likely to give to the detested
                        Sacha. “I quite understand her feeling.”</p>
                    <p>“But you are not coming into Aunt Claudia’s house on the sly,” insisted
                        Hamlin. “In the<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7108-183"/> first place, this house is
                        not Aunt Claudia’s house, but Miss Brown’s house. Aunt Claudia, like you and
                        me, is merely Miss Brown’s guest, and you have come to see Miss Brown. In
                        the second place, my aunt knew you were coming, and went out expressly to
                        avoid meeting you.”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine listened with a slight look of contempt.</p>
                    <p>“So much the better if I am not intruding behind her back. And it is very
                        considerate of Mrs Macgregor to save me what she knows must be a painful
                        scene. But besides Mrs Macgregor, I have myself to think of. I wish to see
                        your aunt. I wish to have the satisfaction of telling her, that however much
                        she may hate the remembrance of me, she cannot hate it more than I do.”</p>
                    <p>There was something theatrical in this which took Hamlin by surprise; but it
                        was the theatricalness of a quixotic and passionate temper, and Anne liked
                        Madame Elaguine for it.</p>
                    <p>“I want to see Mrs Macgregor,” repeated<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7108-184"/> the
                        Russian; “but I don’t want to inflict it upon you, Miss Brown. Indeed I fear
                        it is very ill‐bred and very selfish of me to come to your house merely to
                        make a disagreeable scene: still I can’t resist the desire,” and she shook
                        her little head with its close pale‐yellow curls and deep brown eyes,
                        “only—don’t stay —just tell your aunt that I am here, and that I want to see
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>“I will go and tell Aunt Claudia,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>But as she spoke, Mrs Macgregor entered. The old lady was short‐sighted; and
                        in that room, where the light, concentrated on a few spots, left all the
                        more shadow all round, she did not at first notice the presence of a
                        stranger.</p>
                    <p>“Well, is she gone?” she asked savagely.</p>
                    <p>“Madame Elaguine is here, Aunt Claudia,” answered Anne, quietly.</p>
                    <p>“Here!” exclaimed Mrs Macgregor—“ still in this house!”</p>
                    <p>“And she has remained,” went on Anne, with a weighty coldness which often
                            put<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7108-185"/> down the old lady’s ebullitions,
                        “because she wants to see you again.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was standing by the piano. How he wished his cousin at the devil for
                        inflicting such a scene upon him!</p>
                    <p>“The insolence!” muttered Mrs Macgregor.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine had come forward and stretched out her hand.</p>
                    <p>“I could not come here without seeing you, Aunt Claudia,” she said, in her
                        clear voice. “I want to tell you that, badly, as I behaved as a child, and
                        cruelly unjust though you were towards me, I bear you no ill‐will, and only
                        wish to ask for your forgiveness.”</p>
                    <p>She had sat down opposite to Mrs Macgregor. Hamlin’s aunt scanned her from
                        head to foot; she was taken by surprise, shaken throughout her nature, and
                        at a loss how to answer.</p>
                    <p>“So you are Sacha Polozoff,” said Mrs Macgregor at length, slowly. “I know
                        all the fine trash which Anne talks about the woman not being the same as
                        the child—<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7108-186"/> maybe; I hope so, for your
                        sake. As to forgiveness, you have mine: but forgiveness is only an empty
                        word; it does not cancel what has been done, neither from the memory of God
                        nor of man. Here; <emph>I</emph> forgive you, and take it for what it is
                        worth.”</p>
                    <p>And she stretched out her hand with a bitter smile.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine stooped down and kissed that shaking old hand.</p>
                    <p>“Whatever your forgiveness is worth, I take it joyfully; it cannot undo the
                        past, and it cannot put an end to injustice and hatred,—so far it is
                        worthless. But to me it gives a new life, because I have been able at last
                        to ask forgiveness, to admit all the mischief I have ever done, and to cast
                        away the faults of my childhood from my own clean self,”—she spoke very low,
                        and with tears in her voice, but with passion and pride.</p>
                    <p>“I am happy that you feel so comfortable,” replied Mrs Macgregor, “and that I
                        have been conducive thereto. I am happy also to make<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7108-187"/> your acquaintance, Madame Elaguine, and I hope
                        you will not deprive my nephew and niece of your society on my account.”</p>
                    <p>Sacha bowed; the insult seemed to trickle off her. Anne half wondered, half
                        admired. She could not in the least understand the kind of character which
                        prompted such a useless and hollow ceremony as this; but as to Madame
                        Elaguine, this solemn act of self‐humiliation seemed necessary and just; she
                        admired her for having the courage to carry out her intention.</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye,” said Madame Elaguine, as Anne accompanied her into the anteroom.
                        “I must beg your forgiveness a thousand, thousand times for having made a
                        scene in your house. You see, I am a badly brought‐up woman: I was never
                        taught to do anything except what I liked; and I am what I am, and must say
                        what I feel.”</p>
                    <p>Her tone was very appealing.</p>
                    <p>“Will you forgive me, Madame Elaguine,” said Anne, in her earnest, solemn
                        way, “if I<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7108-188"/> tell you, what it is perhaps a
                        liberty to tell you, that I have always thought my aunt very unjust towards
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>The little thin woman looked up in Anne’s face.</p>
                    <p>“You are good,” she said. “Will you give me a kiss?”</p>
                    <p>Anne stooped down and kissed her shyly on her wan cheek. But a sort of
                        shudder passed through her as her own lips touched that hot face, and grazed
                        the light hair, which seemed to give out some faint Eastern perfume. This
                        woman was so unlike anything she had ever seen—so unlike her own simple
                        self.</p>
                    <p>“You will come and see me—and see my children—won’t you?” asked Madame
                        Elaguine. “I think it will do me good to know you.” She was very excited,
                        and she gasped as if her heart were beating like bursting.</p>
                    <p>“I will come with Mr Hamlin,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>“She is a strange creature,” said Hamlin, as he followed Anne up‐stairs from
                        the door. “Didn’t I tell you she was uncanny?”</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7108-189"/>
                    <p>“I don’t see anything uncanny about her. She is very nervous and
                        excitable—very Russian, I should say—and accustomed always to follow her
                        impulses; but I think she is a brave little woman.”</p>
                    <p>“I can’t make her out. Did you notice her mouth? it looks as if it would
                        bite: and she has strange eyes; one looks into them, and finds she has
                        merely drawn out one’s soul without showing her own.”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed. “Poor little woman! Fancy what her feelings would be if she
                        ever knew all that! I wonder, by the way, whether you ever thought me
                        strange, and told people that I had. a mouth which would bite, and eyes in
                        which you get drowned?”</p>
                    <p>“I always thought,” answered Hamlin, looking at Anne, and seeing her again in
                        that close‐fitting white bodice, with rolled‐up sleeves, bending her
                        magnificent head over the iron‐board in the little nursery, with frescoes of
                        blue skies, and blue seas, and ducks, and people in boats, at the Villa
                        Arnolfini—“I always<pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7108-190"/> thought that you had
                        something strange in you, Miss Brown; some terrible thing to do or to suffer
                        in the future; some great passion or action—I don’t know clearly what, but
                        something heroic; and I think so now—”</p>
                    <p>Anne smiled; but she took his words to heart, for somehow that same
                        impression which he said he had received from her face she had had vaguely
                        in her heart.</p>
                    <p>“I hope the strangeness may consist in being a tolerably well‐behaved and
                        useful young woman,” she said, “and—a tolerably grateful one.”</p>

                    <p>“<hi>I WONDER</hi> whether Anne Brown has really spoken about that Cold
                        Fremley business to Mr Hamlin,” remarked Marjory Leigh to her sister one
                        day, soon after their return to town. “<emph>I</emph> think she’ll never do
                        it, after all.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see how she can,” answered Mary; “at least I can’t conceive doing
                        such a thing. But I don’t think we must judge Anne by ourselves: when once
                        she thinks something ought to be done, she is quite capable of forcing
                        herself to do it. Anne is quite unlike any one else.”</p>
                    <p>“Fiddlestick!” cried Marjory; “you don’t know anything about women,
                        Mary.”</p>
                    <p>But despite her sister’s superior knowledge of womankind and of everything
                        else, Mary<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7108-192"/> Leigh was in the right; perhaps
                        in some cases enthusiastic admiration gives a better clue to action than
                        mere common‐sense. Anne really was made in such a way that when once she was
                        persuaded that any course was the right one, no dislike which she might have
                        to it, no thought of being considered queer, or improper, or quixotic, could
                        restrain her from it. The thing became none the pleasanter to do; but it was
                        done unflinchingly: indeed there was in Anne an almost destructive quality
                        of will, a power of ruthlessly cutting through all obstacles, the passing
                        consciousness of which, joined with the consciousness of the many
                        disagreeable things which it might at any moment force her to go through,
                        produced in her a curious kind of pessimism, which, while it recognised the
                        evil of the world, made that very recognition an incitement to struggle for
                        good. Anne had made up her mind that Hamlin must have the horrible condition
                        of his Cold Fremley tenants explained to him. She fully appreciated the
                        unseemliness, the painfulness<pb n="195" xml:id="VAB7108-193"/>, of such a revelation coming from her; but as there appeared to be
                        no one else who could satisfactorily make it to him, it must be made by her.
                        “It is very simple,” she said to herself: and this was the most
                        characteristic remark that Anne could ever make; for it is curious how very
                        much simpler life does become to people who are in the habit of acting
                        without regard for their own feelings.</p>
                    <p>But it was, though simple, difficult, not on her own account, but on
                        Hamlin’s. In the first few days after her return from Wotton, she had
                        several times been on the point of broaching the subject, but she had
                        desisted on noticing the absolute want of seriousness in Hamlin’s manner,
                        the æsthetic vagueness and fickleness of his thoughts. “He will do nothing
                        practical in this mood,” she said to herself; and as, time after time, she
                        watched for a propitious moment without finding it, Anne became painfully
                        aware, as one becomes aware of some deficiency in a valued piece of property
                        only when it is pointed out, of Hamlin’s<pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7108-194"/> want of seriousness, of his utter want of any habit of asking
                        himself about his responsibilities, or indeed of thinking about anything
                        except himself and the beautiful and weird things which delighted him.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps it is cowardice on my part,” Anne suddenly thought; “perhaps I find
                        that he is not fit to attend to the subject because I dislike mentioning
                        it.” So it must be done at once. Hamlin, she knew, was alone in his studio;
                        he must have finished his afternoon’s work, or very nearly, and there was no
                        Chough, or Lewis, or Dennistoun on the horizon. So Anne closed the piano at
                        which she had been practising some of Chough’s favourite old music, and went
                        down‐stairs. She had made up her mind; but, as she went slowly to the
                        studio, she felt her heart begin to flutter and to beat, and a cold
                        perspiration to start out in her forehead. For all her familiarity with the
                        æsthetic world, in whose apprehension, as Thaddy O’Reilly’s Yankee friend
                        had quietly remarked, “right or wrong don’t exist,”—for<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7108-195"/> all her habit of reading poems in which every
                        unmentionable shamefulness was used as so much vermilion or pale‐green or
                        mysterious grey in a picturesque and suggestive composition,—Anne had
                        retained a constitutional loathing for touching some subjects, which was
                        like the blind instinctive horror of certain animals for brackish water or
                        mud. When Marjory Leigh had first taken her into her confidence, and told
                        her of the pools of sin which stagnated among the starving, unwashed, and
                        unlettered million, Anne had recoiled, and felt a sort of momentary horror
                        for Marjory, a sort of resentment at this foulness thus obtruded on to her;
                        and this feeling, which would sometimes still recur while talking with her
                        philanthropic friend, was perhaps the thing in all her life of which Anne
                        was the most profoundly ashamed. The æsthetes all round her would let all
                        the world rot away in physical hideousness rather than have that physical
                        hideousness put before their eyes; and she, was she not even worse, in her
                        cowardly horror of seeing moral wounds<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7108-196"/> and
                        leprosies? So Anne argued with herself; and she would now face anything; but
                        the feeling of moral sickness was there, however bravely she might look at
                        evil, and try and help to remedy it.</p>
                    <p>“I am a base creature,” Anne thought as she felt her heart fluttering as if
                        it would break loose, as she stood and knocked at the studio door.</p>
                    <p>“Come in,” cried Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>He thought it was the servant, for at first he did not turn round, but
                        continued writing at a beautiful, fantastically inlaid desk in a corner.</p>
                    <p>“It’s I,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>He started up to meet her.</p>
                    <p>“How sweet of you to come, Madonna Anna!” he said, beaming; “I was just
                        wanting so much to see you—I don’t know why—a sort of silly, nostalgic wish.
                        It’s ridiculous to be nostalgic about a person who is on the first floor,
                        when I am on the ground floor, isn’t it? and yet it is so. I was feeling
                        quite an over‐<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7108-197"/> powering desire to see you.
                        And you seem to have felt it, through the ceiling, carpets and all, don’t
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>Anne smiled faintly, but her heart sank.</p>
                    <p>“I also wanted you to see how I have been getting on with my Beatrice,” he
                        said, and rolled an easel into the middle of the room. Anne stood for a
                        moment before the almost Giorgionesquely magnificent picture, looking
                        vaguely at the well‐known lady—with those strange, half‐classic,
                        half‐Semitic, and yet a little Ethiopian, features, those wide grey eyes,
                        that pent‐roof of crisp, lustreless, black hair, those hollowed cheeks and
                        tragic lips which had by this time become so familiar to the artistic world
                        of London. It never seemed to her that this could have anything to do with
                        her, this sombre, mystic, wistful woman of unreality. But she was not
                        thinking of that; she stood at the picture, but almost without seeing
                        it.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was standing a little aside, looking from her to the picture, and from
                        the picture<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7108-198"/> to her, and humming the lines
                        from Dante’s sonnet, which Chough had set to music— <quote>
                            <l>“Ch’ogni lingua divien tremando muta,</l>
                            <l>Egli occhi non ardiscon di guardare.”</l>
                        </quote> “Certainly,” he said to himself, “Dante had not a better Beatrice than
                        this.”</p>
                    <p>“I want to speak to you, Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, suddenly turning round.</p>
                    <p>Something in her voice took him by surprise.</p>
                    <p>“So much the better,” he said, pulling forward a heavy arm‐chair, covered
                        with old‐fashioned green brocade.</p>
                    <p>Anne sat down. How was she to begin? She had intended to prelude with some
                        sort of apology for entering on such a subject; but, somehow, now she could
                        not apologise.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remember a hamlet near Wotton, close by the river, called Cold
                        Fremley?” asked Anne, slowly.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had just caught a look which he wanted for his picture, and he had
                        taken up his painting things.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” and he looked up from his palette in<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7108-199"/>
                        Anne’s pale face, with the almost monochrome faint‐red lips and the
                        delicately hollowed cheeks. “What about it? I remember it quite well. Oh
                        yes, a lovely spot; and we went there one evening together.”</p>
                    <p>“Just so; well, it appears that this hamlet, or rather group of six or seven
                        cabins, belongs to you—is part of the Wotton property.”</p>
                    <p>“Is it? I didn’t know that. Fancy my being the unsuspecting proprietor of
                        such a lovely place! I am so glad; I want to write a poem about it one
                        day.”</p>
                    <p>“And it appears,” went on Anne, carefully steadying her voice, but keeping
                        her eyes on the little cypress‐trees and conventional anemones of the
                        Persian rug under her feet—“it appears that the condition of the people who
                        live in those houses is very, very horrible; the cabins have barely more
                        than one room, into which the whole family is piled.”</p>
                    <p>“Loathsome!” cried Hamlin, with a shudder, “and in such a lovely spot. Do you
                        remember the thick clotted masses of the river dragging<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7108-200"/> between the meadow‐sweet and willow‐herb?”</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> very loathsome,” went on Anne, a coldness coming all over
                        her. “’The people are very wretched, poor, always ill of fever, with no more
                        sense of right and wrong than cattle.”</p>
                    <p>“Very dreadful indeed,” said Hamlin, mixing his paints. “Of course nothing
                        can be done—nothing ever can, you know—”</p>
                    <p>“Something can and must be done!” cried Anne. “It appears that in consequence
                        of this utter wretchedness and ignorance, and especially on account of the
                        degrading effect of being all huddled together, men and women, boys and
                        girls, all of them, in one room which is bedroom, kitchen, sitting‐room,
                        everything at the same time,—it appears that these miserable creatures have
                        gradually come to live worse than animals; they grow, and let their children
                        in turn grow up in horrible, shameful sin.” The difficulty of saying it had
                        vanished; Anne felt that, whether she would<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7108-201"/> or would not, it must come out. Her voice had kept steady, but died out
                        in terrible hoarseness; and her wide‐opened eyes fixed themselves upon
                        Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin let his hand with the palette drop on his knee, and listened with deep
                        attention. “How very strange!” he said; “how very strange—how tragic!”</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> tragic,” cried Anne. “Oh, I think nothing in the wide
                        world can be more tragic! What is the murder of the body to this? or what is
                        any crime which one man can commit towards another, compared with men and
                        women being pushed into wickedness by mere external circumstances, being
                        condemned without knowing it, mere blind, indifferent creatures, to befoul
                        their souls in this way?”</p>
                    <p>Anne had not the slightest thought of being eloquent, but she was, not only
                        in her words, but in her face and look. Hamlin appreciated it; he was
                        struck. Such a view of evil and of fate had never presented itself to him;
                        he recognised how much newer and grander it<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7108-202"/> was than the usual platitude about fatal passion in which he and his
                        school had indulged.</p>
                    <p>“Are you quite sure of this?” he asked, with some interest.</p>
                    <p>“Mrs Collett gave one of the Leighs all the details of it. If you would go to
                        her, she would tell you all about it; she has been afraid, ashamed of
                        mentioning it to you, so I have done it. But if only you would speak to Mrs
                        Collett now, she would explain to you exactly that ought to be done.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not seem to attend.</p>
                    <p>“It is awfully grand,” he mused—“all the grander for the utter
                        unconsciousness, involuntariness. It would make a splendid subject for a
                        poem. I always felt there must be something in that county which should
                        correspond to the tragic look of everything. So much Dennistoun’s notion
                        that there isn’t anything poetical or terrible in reality.”</p>
                    <p>A sickening fear came over Anne. But she drove it from her: she tried to say
                        to herself<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7108-203"/> that she had expected this; that Hamlin, being unaccustomed to any
                        serious thought of the evil of others, and being a poet, would at first take
                        things in this way.</p>
                    <p>“Mrs Collett says that there is hope of saving these miserable creatures by
                        building better dwellings for them; trying to turn Cold Fremley into a
                        village, and setting up a school. I have been thinking over it a great deal
                        myself. Of course I’m very ignorant. But I’ve heard that the river ought to
                        be valuable for water‐power, because there is no other one near; so I
                        thought the simplest would be to try and induce some one—or do it
                        yourself—to set up a factory there. That would give the people work, and
                        give them ideas of decent living, and then a school would have to be
                        opened.”</p>
                    <p>The word <emph>factory</emph> seemed to sear into Hamlin’s nerves.</p>
                    <p>“A factory on that river? on my property? to befoul all that pure and
                        exquisite country with smoke and machine refuse!” he cried indignantly.</p>
                    <pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7108-204"/>
                    <p>“One single factory need not befoul anything,” said Anne, sternly. “And all
                        the smoke and machine refuse in the wide world could not make that
                        neighbourhood one‐hundredth part as foul as it is made by the sin of Cold
                        Fremley. No, not one‐thousandth part as foul as our own hearts, if we let
                        such an evil exist under our eyes.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin seemed moved and puzzled.</p>
                    <p>“It <emph>is</emph> very dreadful,” he mused. “I really had no notion that
                        such things go on nowadays. One is apt to think the world much more
                        commonplace than it is. I will go to Cold Fremley some day soon. I’ll take
                        Lewis with me, he’ll be very much interested in it. I daresay,” he added,
                        “that there’s a great deal of exaggeration about it. But as to the factory,
                        I consider it would be against my conscience to permit such a thing: there
                        is no greater pollution in England than factories; thank Heaven, there are
                        as yet few in our county; and I would rather die than spoil that beautiful
                        peaceful bit of ground.”</p>
                    <pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7108-205"/>
                    <p>Against this Anne felt it useless to struggle.</p>
                    <p>“Since you will not hear of the only plan which would easily improve the
                        condition of those people,” she went on, “let us leave the factory alone; it
                        is not necessary: a few hundred pounds will amply pay for improving,
                        enlarging the six or seven houses of which Cold Fremley consists. As to
                        draining, every one says that were that county drained, it would amply repay
                        the expense by the superior quality of the crops. All that is wanted for the
                        present,” invocated Anne in despair, “is that the people should have more
                        room—that they should not herd like cattle—that the growing children, at
                        least, should not be forced into contact with all that vice. And all that
                        can be gained by merely enlarging the cottages.”</p>
                    <p>“Such a thing as you suggest would—besides being, in my opinion, perfectly
                        useless—involve a very heavy expense,” answered Hamlin, coldly.</p>
                    <p>“Not more,” cried Anne, blazing up—“not<pb n="208" xml:id="VAB7108-206"/>
                        more than you have been at in educating me, Mr Hamlin!”</p>
                    <p>The words were scarcely out of her mouth when she repented of them.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps,” she added sullenly, “that also has been a waste.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer; he was taken by surprise, embarrassed.</p>
                    <p>“The cases are wholly dissimilar. The left hand may not ask the right hand
                        what it has or has not been able to do.”</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean, Mr Hamlin? If you have been spending more than you can
                        afford on me—oh, don’t think I’m not grateful—but please, please, spend no
                        more. This house might be sold. You don’t live in it after all, and Aunt
                        Claudia would be just as happy at Wotton. The house and furniture must be
                        worth a good deal, and then there is the expense of housekeeping in London.
                        Do think of it. I am sure you could raise money enough in that way.”</p>
                    <p>“This house is not mine, Miss Brown,”<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7108-207"/>
                        answered Hamlin, quietly; “it was bought out of your capital; and the
                        expenses you mention are paid out of your income, not mine.”</p>
                    <p>He had wasted all this on her, and the people on his estate lived in foul,
                        sinful hovels! A strange gratitude, mixed with horror, overcame Anne; all
                        the beautiful things about her,—her beautiful fantastic dress, which Hamlin
                        always designed for her, her knowledge and good‐breeding,—all that had been
                        paid for with that money, became loathsome to her.</p>
                    <p>“It is not mine—not mine; I am a mere beggar living off your charity,” she
                        exclaimed—“living off what I have no right to, what ought to go to
                            <emph>them</emph>—to those poor sinful creatures at Cold Fremley. Oh, Mr
                        Hamlin, sell this house, sell the furniture, all, all. Enough has been done
                        for me; I don’t want all these beautiful things in order to be happy; I
                        could be happy anywhere, doing anything, if I knew that there was one evil
                        the less in the world. If there did not remain enough to live upon, I could
                        go out as a governess, or a<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7108-208"/>
                        schoolmistress. I have learned quite enough to do that—indeed I am in
                        earnest—I should be perfectly happy gaining my bread as I used to. Only let
                        something be done for those people—don’t let me feel that every lovely thing
                        I look at, every beautiful thing I hear, every word you say, every pleasure
                        I feel, is as sinful as those sinful lives!”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin smiled; he admired and disbelieved; but what a magnificent woman she
                        was! what passion, what fervour under that cold exterior!</p>
                    <p>“There is no need for that,” he said gently, looking at Anne with admiring
                        and loving eyes. “I am not so poor as that, and I would starve rather than
                        see you deprived of any single thing to which you have a right.”</p>
                    <p>“Then you will go to Cold Fremley? You will see about it?” He was good and
                        generous at bottom—she knew it; and she could have fallen on her knees and
                        cried like a child with her head upon his arm.</p>
                    <p>“I will go to Cold Fremley,” he answered<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7108-209"/>
                        with alacrity. “I want to go there. I want to study the whole matter—”</p>
                    <p>“What do you want to study it for?” asked Anne, suddenly and terribly; “to
                        improve matters, or—to write a poem?”</p>
                    <p>“I do wish to write a poem,” answered Hamlin, who felt no shame for doing so,
                        and resented being thus reproved. “Certainly I wish to write a poem. You
                        made such a fuss about my tearing up that ‘Ballad of the Fens’—well, I now
                        see my way to making use of all the best parts of it, and with a real tragic
                        and passionate motive. As to improving matters, I will look about me. But I
                        totally disbelieve in the utility of giving these people better dwellings.
                        Of course,” he went on gently, but with that tone of knowledge of the evil
                        of the world which Anne so much hated—“of course <emph>you</emph>, who are
                        pure and upright, who cannot conceive the reality of lust and the
                        fascination of evil—<emph>you</emph> can never understand the hold which
                        evil has in this world; you cannot understand that the passion for sin
                            may<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7108-210"/> exist as there exists in you the
                        passion for good; that most men receive in their father’s blood, in their
                        mother’s milk, the haschisch of sinful desire,—that the more they grow, the
                        more it grows in them—that it is their very life, and is perpetually seeking
                        for aliment. Evil is; it cannot be stamped out.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s eyes sparkled, and he spoke with a flush; but there was no
                        excitement, no horror in his tone. Anne felt that he was reciting in prose
                        what he would soon write in verse.</p>
                    <p>“In short,” she said, “you think the sinfulness of the people of Cold Fremley
                        fits very well into the landscape? You think it, as you said, very
                        picturesque and grand?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was a man who could not easily keep at high moral tension.</p>
                    <p>“Well, yes,” he answered; “of course it <emph>is</emph> very shocking, and if
                        anything could be done, why, I should be glad. But I <emph>know</emph>
                        nothing can be done; and although it is very much to be regretted, yet I
                        don’t think you can deny<pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7108-211"/> that there is
                        something very grand and tragic in this sin flowering like evil grasses in
                        that marsh.”</p>
                    <p>“I see,” said Anne, faintly—everything seemed to be turning all round her;
                        “good‐bye.”</p>
                    <p>“You mustn’t be angry with me,” said Hamlin, following her to the studio
                        door. “You see I, unfortunately, have much more experience of life and evil
                        than you will ever have. I know that fatality of sin; and that makes me take
                        things in a different way from how you take them.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s voice sounded faint and distant to Anne, hollow like an echo in a
                        whispering chamber. She went mechanically up‐stairs; she did not know how
                        she felt, but everything seemed surrounded by thick, clammy horror; the
                        world was going to pieces. When she had shut the door of her room behind
                        her, she threw herself with her face on her bed, and burst into an agony of
                        half‐audible sobs. But when at length hours passed, and the maid<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7108-212"/> came to ask whether she would come to tea, Anne
                        felt no better; a black despair weighed upon her. On her dressing‐table
                        stood a Japanese jar, filled with delicate autumnal roses; they had the
                        pallor, the diaphanous purity which the frost gives to flowers, as
                        approaching death gives it sometimes to human creatures. Anne looked at
                        them; and then, without passion or excitement, she took them out of the
                        vase, and threw them into the fire. She watched the petals shrivel and fall
                        to black dust on the flame, and the leaves and stalks turn slowly, with a
                        hissing noise, into glowing embers. Then she felt ashamed. The poor flowers
                        were pure—they at least were clean—and she had destroyed them. And Anne
                        buried her head in her hands, and began to sob once more.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> Leigh girls never discovered which of them was in the right; and
                        as Anne never made any further allusion to Cold Fremley, they concluded that
                        she had not spoken to Hamlin about it. Hamlin noticed no change in her, but
                        then he never expected to see one: Anne became gradually more silent, more
                        indifferent, more abrupt in her answers. Some people said, “She is getting
                        spoilt by being made too much of;” and others, like Thaddy O’Reilly, hinted
                        that the vagaries and splendours of æsthetic society, the poems and music
                        and improprieties of Chough and Dennistoun, the nudities and Elizabethan
                        dramatists of Lewis, were beginning to pall upon Miss Brown. “I’ll bet
                        anything,” said Thaddy<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7108-214"/> O’Reilly, “that as
                        soon as they are married, the new Mrs Hamlin will abandon Mantegnesque
                        costumes, will open a bill with Worth, and insist upon hiring a house in
                        Belgravia for at least one season.” So said Thaddy O’Reilly; but it must be
                        added that he said it to Mrs Spencer, to alarm and anger whose hereditary
                        high‐art passions was the little journalist’s great delight. Anne still went
                        out into æsthetic society, she still listened to new poems and to literary
                        discussions, she still sat to Hamlin and to half‐a‐dozen other painters; but
                        when people at concerts or the play used to point out Miss Brown as the
                        queen of æstheticism, they little guessed how far removed were the thoughts
                        of this queen from her realm and her subjects. Ever since that memorable
                        conversation about Cold Fremley, beautiful things,—all the things—poetry,
                        painting, music, romance—which had originally surrounded Hamlin with a sort
                        of luminous emanation in Anne’s eyes,—had grown loathsome to her. She knew
                        that it was unfair<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7108-215"/> and absurd, but she
                        could not resist the feeling that all the fair forms and sound patterns and
                        imaginary passions of poetry—nay, that the very beauty of nature, where any
                        existed—were foul; and her soul shrank from them as from contamination. She
                        began to take a grim pleasure in that sordid ugliness which had, on her
                        arrival in London, given her such a shock, and to which Hamlin and his
                        friends were always shutting their eyes. The fog, the black ooze, the
                        melancholy monotony of griminess, the hideousness of the men and women in
                        the streets, jarred upon her much less than the beautiful pictures of
                        Italian scenery which Hamlin hung up at Hammersmith,—than the lovely,
                        mysterious creatures in jewel‐coloured robes, wandering in distant countries
                        of bliss and romance, which Hamlin painted. The poetry of pure beauty
                        sickened her; and she could not take up even the purest poems of that
                        school, not even the mere charming pieces of decoration of Morris, without
                        putting them down with disgust. She began to feel a vague<pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7108-216"/> nostalgic longing after her own past: faint
                        recollections of her father’s grimy, workshop at Spezia, of the poor little
                        room where her mother had sat doing cheap dressmaking, returned to her. The
                        life at Florence, the sordid life with the Perrys, the tattered furniture
                        and ill‐swept rooms, the dirty and noisy kitchen with the haunting smell of
                        sink; the dull routine of washing and ironing and mending, of dressing and
                        undressing the refractory children, of teaching them their letters and
                        trying to keep them tidy; the ill‐will, the muttered anger, the jeering
                        scraps of song of the other servants, who resented Anne’s superiority,—all
                        these recollections which had almost been effaced during her happy new life
                        at Coblenz and in London, returned to her, vivid as reality, and filled her
                        with unaccountable yearning. And yet, when she asked herself what this
                        meant, she could not but confess that she was different from what she had
                        then been; that she had absorbed too much of the new life ever to be happy
                        in the<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7108-217"/> old one—nay, that that very
                        indignation with the mere selfish worship of beauty which made all things
                        seem black in her eyes, would never have been possible had she remained a
                        mere servant. Hamlin had redeemed her soul; he had made her a thinking and
                        feeling being—but what for? She dared not admit to herself that it was
                        merely in order that she should despise him.</p>
                    <p>But Anne pushed aside these thoughts. She felt that she had no right to
                        indulge in them—that she must give her mind to other things, her heart and
                        her energy. Without exactly knowing what she could do, or even whether she
                        could do anything at all, she felt that she must work—work with all her
                        might; for it seemed as if all the thoughts which the people about her
                        refused to think, all the sympathy which they refused to feel, all the work
                        which they refused to do, and all the sacrifices which they refused to make,
                        must all be taken upon herself—as if she alone must bear this terrible
                        weight of rejected responsibilities. So Anne<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7108-218"/> worked. Her cousin Dick had said that no one could do any good in
                        ignorance; and she felt herself shamefully ignorant of all but useless
                        things. She got together a whole heap of books and pamphlets on every
                        possible kind of grievance and evil in the world; she made Marjory Leigh
                        tell her all the dreadful things which she knew, show her all the dreadful
                        things which she had seen. Of such things Marjory and her young man, the
                        East End curate, could tell her but too many; yet Anne was not satisfied.
                        She sought the acquaintance of Marjory’s colleagues in the work of helping
                        the poor, and of Harry Collett’s fellow‐workers—older men and women, whose
                        account of the evil of the world, less exaggerated and poetical than
                        Marjory’s and Harry’s, was still more grimly tragic. They were hopeful
                        nevertheless; but Anne, returning home from her attendance on lectures, her
                        ghastly rounds in the slums,—home to the lovely house, with the Persian
                        carpets, the 18th‐century hangings and furniture, the old majolica and
                            Japanese<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7108-219"/> ware, the flowers and the
                        books of music,—returning home to the discussions on art and literature in
                        Hamlin’s studio and at her own dinner‐table,—Anne felt mere despair. For, it
                        must be remembered, Anne had none of those consoling thoughts to fall back
                        upon which religion, however conventional, affords. Her father, a Radical
                        workman of the French school, had brought her up with a few elementary ideas
                        of right and wrong, and the faith that all priests, like all kings, were the
                        curse of the world. Miss Curzon, the kind‐hearted old <foreign xml:lang="ita">prima donna</foreign> who had taken charge of her in her
                        earliest girlhood, had given her examples of only the most frivolous
                        Voltairianism; from the servants and the Italians who surrounded her at the
                        Perrys, she had learned only a contempt for the conscienceless mummeries of
                        the lowest Catholicism; from Mrs Perry only a contempt, as great in its way,
                        for the heartless conventionalism of mere social Protestantism; and from
                        Hamlin himself, and Hamlin’s friends (for at Coblenz he had stipulated<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7108-220"/> that Miss Brown was not to be <emph>bored with religion</emph>),
                        she had heard only of the religion of beauty. Of the men and women who used
                        to come to Hammersmith and to Wotton, some, like Chough, professed
                        Catholicism, and wrote mystical rhapsodies to the Virgin Mary; others, like
                        Dennistoun, called the Virgin a prostitute, and God a highway murderer: some
                        went in for imitating the <foreign xml:lang="fre">näiveté</foreign> of
                        medieval Christianity; yet others filled their books with hymns to the gods,
                        clean and foul, of paganism. There was a deal of vociferating on the
                        subject; a deal of abusive language both of the religious and the
                        irreligious; a deal of exhortation on the part of men like Hamlin not to
                        have the bad taste to muddle religion with poetry; and on the whole, there
                        was an atmosphere of absolute insincerity, in which, as in abstract politics
                        (for certain æsthetes were extreme retrogrades, and loathed civilisation;
                        while others would pour out by the hour revolutionary tirades of the most
                        blood‐thirsty description), it appeared that religion<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7108-221"/> was a mere personal hobby or poetical fiction:
                        the usual conclusion being simply that the world was too disgusting a place
                        for a well‐constituted soul; that the century was empty, and heartless, and
                        emasculate; and that, as the people in the ‘Decameron’ fled from the plague,
                        and told stories and sang songs in a pleasant villa all by themselves, so
                        also must superior men and women fly from the sordidness, the
                        uninterestingness, the mediocrity, and incapacity for passion of reality,
                        and entertain one another with tales of romance and wonder in a fairy land,
                        where the sole divinity was beauty, and where alone, among the lovely and
                        noble things left by the past, noble natures could develop uncramped,
                        according to the ideal of the Greeks, of medieval men, or of that most
                        elevated genius, the late Théophile Gautier.</p>
                    <p>To meet the terrible realities which were now being revealed to her, to
                        answer her own painful craving after usefulness, Anne had therefore only a
                        vain negative belief—the pessimism which<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7108-222"/>
                        is at the bottom of all æstheticism, the belief in the fatal supremacy of
                        evil and ugliness. But in Anne this purely negative creed speedily became
                        positive; pessimism produced not a desire to abandon the odious reality and
                        take refuge in mere imaginary happiness, but a frightful moral tension, a
                        constant battle of her aspirations with her belief, of her conscience with
                        her reason, a strain of rebellion against the inevitable. So, to the weight
                        of the knowledge of evil, to the weight of the consciousness of the deadness
                        of soul which surrounded her, was added in Anne the terrible sense of the
                        injustice and callousness of nature and of fate, of the groundlessness of
                        those instincts of good which left her no peace.</p>
                    <p>But all this no one ever guessed. She despised indulging her own
                        wretchedness. She went on, behaving as usual, goading herself to practical
                        concerns silently, letting no one know of her misery, letting no thought of
                        it waste a moment of her time. Her longing was to break the hateful
                        solidarity between<pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7108-223"/> herself and the school
                        of æsthetic indifferentism; her instinct was, since she (dependent as she
                        felt herself on a man’s charity) could not practically help others, at least
                        to understand and feel about all these subjects which Hamlin and his friends
                        tabooed. And with this haunting desire, she turned not merely to Marjory Lee
                        and Harry Collett, but instinctively also to her cousin Dick.</p>
                    <p>“I have read the books you lent me to take into the country,” she said,
                        giving him back the various primers and pamphlets on economical subjects.
                        “Thank you so much for them, Dick.”</p>
                    <p>They were sitting alone in the drawing‐room at Hammersmith. Richard Brown had
                        called only once before, ceremoniously and briefly, and he would not have
                        come this time either, if Anne had not written expressly to beg him to fetch
                        back the books. He looked at her in his incredulous, contemptuous way.</p>
                    <p>“Really,” he said, “my shabby old books are very much flattered by having
                        been permitted<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7108-224"/> to sojourn so long among such an assemblage of lovely things;” and
                        he looked round the room at the pieces of embroidery and the Eastern
                        carpets, the pictures and drawings, the quantities of Japanese porcelain and
                        lacquer all round. “How much out of place they do look, and how queer they
                        must have felt among their companions! Let me see: two volumes on artistic
                        furniture—‘Ballads of Old France’—‘Rossetti’—‘Contes de Gautier.’ I
                        see—”</p>
                    <p>“Those are Mr Hamlin’s books,” said Anne, quickly; “he must have taken them
                        out of the library, or brought them up from the studio. I am not reading any
                        of them.”</p>
                    <p>“You are reading nothing but sociology and political economy; I understand,”
                        went on Brown, with his placid sneer, which seemed, in this frightfully
                        masculine man, to condemn in Anne her mind, her person, her manner, her
                        character, and even her sex. “Ah, well, I can understand that; it must be
                        refreshing. Who is it—Mr Pater, or some such great gun of yours—who says
                        that the object of the wise<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7108-225"/> man is to make
                        his life consist in as many moments of thrilling impressions as possible;
                        that the very wise people get them out of art and song, and the less wise
                        out of vice or out of philanthropy? You must know the passage better than I.
                        Well, I suppose you have got as many impressions out of art and song as
                        possible, and (being far too delicate in taste to try vice) you are seeing
                        what can be got out of philanthropy. Is that it?”</p>
                    <p>Anne frowned.</p>
                    <p>“Of course,” she said, “you think it very clever to snub me, Dick, and very
                        manly; just to treat me as if I could not possibly have either heart or
                        brains. Maybe; but it is a very cheap sort of sarcasm, and to make which a
                        man like you is not at all required.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown bit his black beard, and looked at Anne from beneath his beetle
                        brows; he threw himself a little back on his chair, and with his head on one
                        side, he said, with affected indifference—</p>
                    <p>“You don’t mean to tell me that you<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7108-226"/> have
                        read those books except as you would read—what shall I say?—the ‘History of
                        Furniture,’ or the ‘Contes de Gautier,’ Anne?”</p>
                    <p>“Were you ever ignorant about important vital subjects, Richard—ever
                        conscious that it was your duty as a rational creature to know something
                        about them, and then snubbed by a man who knew all about them, and to whom
                        you had applied to help you?”</p>
                    <p>Brown was silent for a moment.</p>
                    <p>“I was a poor lad, working in a factory, and refusing myself food and coals
                        in order to buy books and papers”—he said crushingly—“and I never had an
                        opportunity of asking any one’s assistance.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see why there should be salvation only for people who have gone
                        through hardships, nor why only you and those who have acted like you should
                        be treated sincerely and seriously. Do you think that because I am a woman
                        who has been brought up among Persian rugs and Japanese pots and Burne
                        Jones’s pictures,—because I have gone to dinner‐parties<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7108-227"/> three times a‐week, and read Pater and Rossetti and Gautier,—that
                        I may not therefore be as honestly anxious to know about the serious things
                        of the world as you were when you worked in a factory, and went without
                        dinner and without coals?” and she fixed her eyes on her cousin’s ugly and
                        powerful face, in which, for all its ugliness, one might have fancied one
                        saw something not wholly unlike that magnificent sibyl‐like face which
                        pre‐Raphaelite artists had immortalised and caricatured. “Seriously, and in
                        your heart,” she went on, as Brown made no reply, “are you unable to
                        understand that perhaps it may require more real determination to try and
                        learn such things when one is brought up in luxury in an æsthetic house,
                        than when one has to buy books at the price of food and fire?”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown did not answer. He was a frank man, and he frankly faced Anne’s
                        look, and in return looked long and searchingly at her; and as the habitual
                        look of bantering contempt had given way to a serious scrutiny,<pb n="230" xml:id="VAB7108-228"/> so now he gradually grew more gentle and
                        earnest.</p>
                    <p>“Forgive me, Anne,” he said, after a moment; “I think I may have been doing
                        you injustice, and that I may, to some degree, have been disgracing myself.
                        But, you see, I am a plain self‐made man, and it is difficult for me to
                        understand how . . .”</p>
                    <p>Brown rarely hesitated for the end of his sentence, but this time he did.</p>
                    <p>“To understand how there can be any conscience or seriousness in a woman who
                        has been willing to owe everything to the generosity of an æsthete like Mr
                        Hamlin”—Anne finished his sentence bitterly. She went on—“Well, I know you
                        could not believe that an æsthete could be generous and noble and
                        chivalrous; and now you cannot understand how a woman who has accepted his
                        generosity can be anything better than—than a piece artistic embroidery, or
                        a Japanese cup, or a green tree,” and Anne pulled the long pliable leaves of
                        a palm passionately through her fingers.</p>
                    <pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7108-229"/>
                    <p>Brown’s suspiciousness had tried to return; but it was routed by Anne’s firm
                        look, by Anne’s frank words.</p>
                    <p>“It is terrible to think how prejudiced, how inaccessible to truth, one
                        allows one’s self to become,” answered Brown, “even though, Heaven knows,
                        one tries to be fair. What you say is true. I couldn’t understand your not
                        being a mere frivolous girl, Anne; and I can’t well understand it yet. But
                        what you tell me I will believe.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you, Dick,” said Anne, stretching out her hand. “I don’t think we are
                        made to like each other much: you are too prejudiced, and haughty, and
                        contemptuous; and I am too proud and too stiff‐necked. But we are both
                        honest, so we might as well deal honestly and openly with each other, and
                        try and understand each other’s good points.”</p>
                    <p>“I am not accustomed to deal with semi‐professional beauties, to do the
                        Petrarch to æsthetic <foreign xml:lang="ita">Madonna mias</foreign>,” said
                        Brown—that sneer of conscious masculinity and conscious<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7108-230"/> self‐madeness coming over him again; “you must
                        excuse my manner, Anne.” But he met Anne’s glance, and his tone changed once
                        more.</p>
                    <p>“I will bring you some more books when I return,” he said. “By the way, have
                        you ever read any psychology?”</p>
                    <p>“What is psychology? Is it metaphysics? I have read Hegel—” Anne stopped
                        short, and then boldly added—</p>
                    <p>“ But it was only Hegel’s æsthetics, you know.”</p>
                    <p>Brown smiled. “Hegel’s æsthetics are not—well—not Posthlethwaite’s
                        æsthetics,” he said; “this is not much more difficult. It is Spencer’s
                        sociology. I will bring it you. Good‐bye.”</p>
                    <p>After that visit, Anne began to see more of her cousin. He came sometimes to
                        Hammersmith, and he met her frequently at the Leighs. Anne did not feel that
                        she completely liked him. He was pure‐minded, certainly, and generous, a man
                        devoted to progress even in<pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7108-231"/> its humblest
                        forms; he had a powerful intellect and a more powerful will. But, somehow,
                        there was in him an indefinable coarseness of fibre, a want of appreciation,
                        of sympathy with other people’s ideals, a tendency to despise all those
                        around him, and to see meanness in all those who were not in the same
                        position, or who had not the same views and aims as himself; above all, an
                        unconscious desire to domineer—a brutal, almost animal wish for supremacy,
                        which his knowledge of his own purity and rectitude and self‐sacrificing
                        power made him accept and cherish as if it were a kind of holy spirit
                        dwelling within himself, and not merely the product of a brutal temperament,
                        which a noble intellect and a generous heart had severed from all brutish
                        interests, but which remained brutal none the less. Anne’s pride, her
                        consciousness of finer fibre than her cousin’s, made her shrink from seeking
                        in Richard Brown for assistance in her arduous task of freeing her spirit
                        from the slough of æsthetic selfishness; his suspiciousness of her motives,
                        his sarcasms,<pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7108-232"/> his blindness to her purity
                        of impulse, all this galled her; but she submitted to be galled. She wished
                        her soul at least to be free, though her body might remain, as it were, in
                        bondage, and Richard stood at the door of that world of nobler endeavour
                        which she longed to enter; moreover, her stern spirit made her take a sort
                        of pleasure in the very bitterness which she had to taste. If Richard had
                        been sympathising, if he had met her half‐way and tried to help her on, she
                        would have felt that she was bound to him, that she was battering her
                        liberty once more; and vaguely Anne knew that she must never be bound to any
                        one save Hamlin—that little as he could understand her, she was obliged, for
                        ever, to try and understand him. And sometimes even, though the sense of
                        Hamlin’s baseness, of his selfish æstheticism and his untruthful morbidness,
                        weighed more upon her day by day, Anne would elaborately go over all that he
                        had been to her—nay, all that, to the best of his power, he still was: she
                        would sit for hours reading<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7108-233"/> and re‐reading
                        those treasured‐up letters whose arrival had made her so strangely happy at
                        Coblenz; (how long, long ago it seemed, and how little that schoolgirl
                        seemed to share of her identity!) and Anne, reading over those letters,
                        carefully collecting together all the stances of Hamlin’s generosity and
                        delicacy and gentleness which she could remember—nay, mere looks and tones
                        which had brought home formerly her love for him—made up out of them a
                        simulacrum of Hamlin, and persuaded herself that she loved it, and that it
                        was Hamlin’s real reality, the reality which had become spoilt by the
                        horrible moral atmosphere, distorted, warped, but a reality nevertheless.
                        Nay, sometimes the sense of Hamlin’s weakness would come home to her, and
                        with a pang make her feel how much she was bound to suffer, how much she was
                        bound to do for him.</p>

                    <p><hi>HAMLIN</hi> had forgotten all about the business of Cold Fremley, except
                        that he had stopped the printing of his book, and set to work remodelling
                        the “Ballad of the Fens,” to the immense admiration of Chough and
                        Dennistoun, who were quite reconciled to realism now that it was allied with
                        horrid sin. But that Anne was at all alienated from him, never once entered
                        his mind. He noticed, indeed, that Anne had grown much more serious of late,
                        that she seemed less happy than some months before; but for that he had his
                        explanation. He believed that her character was suddenly maturing (for he
                        never guessed that Anne’s nature was one of those which mature rapidly, and
                        whose maturity means<pb n="237" xml:id="VAB7108-235"/> responsibility), and
                        that there was brewing beneath that sombre exterior a storm of passion of
                        which he was the object. That such a storm would come had been his
                        persuasion from the very beginning of his acquaintance with Anne; he had
                        guessed in her some strange latent force, and to see it develop had been his
                        wish. That long courtship, that purely Platonic familiarity, giving scope to
                        so much poetic devotion, poetic gratitude, was always to end, in Hamlin’s
                        expectation, with a sudden burst of passion, which should envelop him, give
                        his cold nature the exquisite sensation of being fired, carried off by a
                        more powerful temperament than his own. Hamlin had had many love‐affairs in
                        his day, more or less pure or base; he had, once or twice, been mastered by
                        the stronger nature of a woman, but that had been mere brute passion, and
                        what he desired was to rouse a passion terrifically overwhelming, but pure,
                        intellectual, and with all the fearful violence of merely intellectual
                        passions: a passion like<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7108-236"/> that, which he
                        always admired more than any other in literature, of Heathcliff for
                        Catharine in ‘Wuthering Heights,’—a passion such as some men have felt for a
                        dead woman. This he had always hoped from Anne, and in the expectation of
                        this he had been confirmed by every new revelation of her character.
                        Sometimes, when Anne sat listless in the midst of their guests, her mind for
                        away, her tragic face more sombre for the blackness that was in the world
                        around her and in her own soul, Hamlin would watch her, and feel, with a
                        pang of satisfaction, that he had not been mistaken in her.</p>
                    <p>“She is not a woman, she is a mere splendid statue!” Lewis had once exclaimed
                        angrily, as he felt how utterly all that kind of occult sensual fascination,
                        which his pale mysterious face, his vermilion lips, his cat‐like green eyes,
                        his low droning voice, his sultan‐like freedom of manner, his sense of
                        omniscience and omnipotence, his own nature, strangely compounded of the
                        beast and of<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7108-237"/> the dreamer, indubitably
                        exercised over many women, how utterly it trickled off Anne—</p>
                    <p>“She is not a woman, Hamlin,—she has an intellect and a will, but she has no
                        soul; and one day you will discover it.”</p>
                    <p>“She is not a woman in the sense in which you conceive a woman,” answered
                        Hamlin, contemptuously; “and she is as incapable of what you and most of us
                        call passion, as is a statue. She has not one fibre of what you could call
                        womanhood in her—not one shred of the beast which lies at the bottom of all
                        our natures has entered into hers; she is a woman of mere stone and ice and
                        snow for men like you. But just for that reason has she got a capacity for
                        passion—for a passion which you can never understand—such as no other woman
                        ever had. What are all those precious women—Cleopatras and Mary Stuarts—call
                        them whatever you like, whom we think so poetical? Mere common harlots,
                        decked out in poetical gewgaws, at bottom nothing better than a Madame
                        Bovary, not so much as a Manon Lescaut<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7108-238"/>. Mere filthy clay shaped into something comely. What is it to be
                        loved by one of them? You might as well be loved by a barmaid.”</p>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis’s lip curled.</p>
                    <p>“Certainly Miss Brown suits you in your present mood, Walter; I don’t say
                        not. But you will find out later what it is to be in love with a woman who
                        is stone and ice and snow for men like me. Madonna Laura and Beatrice are
                        all very fine; but your ideal lady, I repeat it, is no woman at all, but a
                        mere sexless creature, something like Victor Hugo’s handsome Enjolras in
                        petticoats. Passion for humanity, for fame, for abstract excellence‐oh, as
                        much of that as you like; but passion for so humble a thing as a living man!
                        Never!”</p>
                    <p>“Please leave the subject alone, Lewis,” said Hamlin. “I don’t care to have
                        slugs creeping, even only in imagination, over my lilies. Talk about
                            <emph>your</emph> women, other men’s women, as much as you choose, but
                        spare me your remarks about Miss Brown.”</p>
                    <p>Chough had been listening. The excitable<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7108-239"/>
                        little poet of womanhood detested Lewis, whose arrogance grated upon him,
                        and whose impurity of nature unconsciously offended the real innocence which
                        underlay all his grandiloquently improper verses. And Chough adored Anne;
                        she was, he often said, a quite new revelation of womanhood; and he believed
                        that, as passion was the one noble thing in the world, and as Miss Brown was
                        the noblest woman that had ever lived, that there must be a deal of passion
                        in Anne.</p>
                    <p>“There is passion of all sorts,” said Chough, pulling his long black
                        whiskers; “the passion of the pure animal, the passion of the mere human
                        creature, and the passion of divine essences: the first is like a lush
                        tropical country; the second is like the manifold sea; the third is like the
                        high Alps, the highest strata of air, the purest light. The passion of
                        divine essences is more terrible than any other, exactly because of its
                        external nature: it is tragic. Miss Brown has that sort of passion—”</p>
                    <pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7108-240"/>
                    <p>“Idiot,” muttered Hamlin ; and yet he felt pleased at Chough’s mystical
                        corroboration of his ideas.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile there was one subject upon which Anne sympathised warmly with
                        Hamlin, and that was his cousin Sacha. For all her evident theatricalness,
                        Anne warmed towards Madame Elaguine. She saw in her something frank and
                        fearless which appealed to her, and a pathetic helpless desire, as of a
                        child which has been naughty but wants to learn how to be good, to retrieve
                        her own wasted life, to save her children from what she had undergone
                        herself; above all, a wish to be in earnest without well knowing how to, a
                        strain to be a serious woman in the midst of the habits of a spoilt child
                        and of a flirt. For a spoilt child, unaccustomed to self‐control, impatient
                        of small sacrifices, avid of excitement and novelty, avid of constant
                        attention and admiration, Madame Elaguine certainly was; and a flirt as
                        certainly also. She flirted with every one, with Hamlin, with as many of
                            his<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7108-241"/> friends—Chough, Lewis, and
                        Dennistoun—as he took to her; with Anne, with the Leigh girls, with the
                        solemn schoolmasters and schoolmistresses, whom she interviewed for the
                        benefit of her children; she flirted—you saw it by her smile and her little
                        childish laugh of recognition—with the very housemaid who opened the door;
                        she flirted with every man, woman, and child, with every dog or cat that she
                        came across.</p>
                    <p>“What a flirt that woman is, to be sure!” cried Hamlin, as he saw every one
                        of his and Anne’s friends subjugated in an hour’s visit by Madame Elaguine.
                        And to be a flirt was no recommendation to Hamlin; he wanted to absorb all
                        admiration, he wanted to inspire love; flirts were his particular
                        aversion.</p>
                    <p>“What harm does her flirting do?” answered Anne; “it merely makes her and
                        those about her a little happier.”</p>
                    <p>“I thought you cared only for serious, for intense people, Miss Brown—you who
                        are so serious and intense yourself.”</p>
                    <pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7108-242"/>
                    <p>“Perhaps I am too serious”—and poor Anne felt at the moment that she
                        certainly was too serious to be very happy; “but, however that may be, that
                        is no reason why your cousin should not be a flirt. As long as a person can
                        feel strongly and seriously on serious subjects, why quarrel with him or her
                        for being childish about childish matters?”</p>
                    <p>For experience had taught Anne the bitter truth that people could be
                        serious—heaven knows how serious!—like the odious Lewis and like Hamlin
                        himself, and yet have no fibre of sympathy or indignation; and her
                        experience of flippant little Chough, with his tenderly cared for wife—of
                        flirtatious Marjory Leigh and her humanitarian labours—had made her hope
                        most from the very people whose light nature she, so earnest and tragic,
                        could understand least. And to this category she added Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“Your cousin has strong sides to her nature, I am quite persuaded,” she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin shrugged his shoulders; but nevertheless<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7108-243"/>, though he highly resented Madame Elaguine’s all‐round
                        flirtatiousness, he was forced to admit to himself that the little woman
                        had, when you were in her presence, a sort of magnetic fascination.</p>
                    <p>What moved Anne was Madame Elaguine’s vehement passion for her children, the
                        long schemes which, to Hamlin’s <foreign xml:lang="fre">ennui</foreign>, she
                        would enthusiastically dilate upon for their future; and somehow, from words
                        which she used to drop, it would seem that she had been in danger of losing
                        those children—that she was still exposed to having them taken from her, or
                        to being in some way separated from them. Anne did not absolutely formulate
                        to herself a hope of helping Madame Elaguine; but she felt vaguely that
                        perhaps she, with her seriousness and determination, might help the
                        excitable and decidedly vague‐minded little woman to persist in and carry
                        out her ideas; that here she had at last a chance of being useful. The first
                        thing, Anne felt, was to bridge over the gulf of past animosity which still
                            separated<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7108-244"/> Hamlin from his cousin—to
                        take away from Sacha Elaguine the demoralising sense of being an only
                        half‐forgiven intruder. The great difficulty was Mrs Macgregor. The old lady
                        could not abate one tittle of her hatred for the Sacha of former days.</p>
                    <p>“I tell you she is a bad woman, and you will find it out some day to your
                        cost,” she would answer Anne. “The woman is contained in the child: or
                        rather the woman is only the child altered and trimmed up to pass
                            muster—<foreign xml:lang="ger">dressirt</foreign>, as my friend
                        Schopenhauer says.”</p>
                    <p>“But, Auntie Claudia,” persisted Anne, “if a person can alter sufficiently to
                        pass muster, why should that person not alter also in obedience to her
                        awakened reason and conscience? Why should one not be able to shed the bad
                        qualities of one’s childhood, for quite new and good ones?”</p>
                    <p>“Because one cannot, Anne; because the fox remains a fox, and the cat remains
                        a cat, and the swine remains a swine.” And Mrs Macgregor looked with cynical
                        compassion at Anne.</p>
                    <pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7108-245"/>
                    <p>“I might have remained a mere soulless servant, had every one gone on your
                        theory,” answered Anne. “No, I cannot agree with you, Aunt Claudia. I think
                        it is terrible to condemn a woman because she was a good‐for‐nothing child;
                        I think it is terrible to shut her out from sympathy which might be a
                        comfort and an encouragement to her if she be still in need of any.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, well, that is how you young people of to‐day always talk. You would
                        object to sending criminals to the docks, because it is shutting them out of
                        improving society.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see that the cases are parallel. I merely ask that a person be not
                        condemned where she could not be responsible. If I thought that any one were
                        really and hopelessly vicious, a mere source of evil, I think I should do my
                        best to crush them out, to trample upon them.”</p>
                    <p>“That is how you are, Anne, willing to be a moral sick‐nurse or a moral
                        executioner. In a world where every one has some horrid<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7108-246"/> moral disease or is some horrid moral nuisance,
                        you will soon find that such a line as that leaves no time to live. However,
                        as to Sacha Polozoff—Madame Elaguine, I suppose I ought to call her—do
                        whatever you please. You are your own mistress, and free to choose your own
                        friends. See as much of the woman as you please, as long as you don’t expect
                        me to sympathise with you in your admiration, love, and awe of her.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t feel any admiration or love or awe for Madame Elaguine. But I think
                        that she is a comparatively young woman, very impulsive and rather
                        injudicious, all alone here in London; and I think she ought not to be shut
                        out from the only house which she has, as Mr Hamlin’s cousin, a sort of
                        right to enter.”</p>
                    <p>“As you choose, Anne. Invite her, give up the house to her; do what you
                        please. But remember, when you have burnt your fingers, that I told you you
                        were playing with fire.”</p>
                    <pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7108-247"/>
                    <p>So Anne had her way. And Madame Elaguine came often to Hammersmith. Hamlin
                        and Anne did their best to prevent her meeting Mrs Macgregor; Madame
                        Elaguine was received mainly in the studio, where, little by little, and at
                        first seemingly casually, Hamlin’s friends would drop in to meet her. She
                        was a curiously fascinating little woman. Education, in any regular sense,
                        she seemed never to have had; she was grotesquely ignorant about a great
                        many things, and laughed at it herself.</p>
                    <p>“I am teaching myself arithmetic in order to teach my boy a little before he
                        goes to school,” she would say—or spelling, or grammar, or something
                        similar. On the other hand, she had a lot of superficial accomplishments,
                        like most Russians: she spoke four or five languages with tolerable
                        correctness and extraordinary fluency; she had, in some mysterious manner,
                        acquired Greek. She read little, and that little mainly novels and poetry;
                        but, with her Russian rapidity to adapt herself to a new position,<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7108-248"/> she had scarcely realised that she had
                        been accidentally drafted into æsthetical society, before she had got
                        æsthetic literature, æsthetic gossip, and æsthetic modes of feeling at her
                        finger‐ends. She immediately understood the relative positions of Hamlin, of
                        Chough, of Dennistoun, of Lewis, and of all the others; and was able to talk
                        to each as he best liked to be talked to. She began with a passion for
                        Alfred de Musset, for Gautier, for Catulle Mendès, and she rapidly became an
                        enthusiast for Swinburne, for Rossetti, for Chough, and, above all, “for
                        that genius, <foreign xml:lang="fre">Monsieur mon cousin</foreign>.” She let
                        herself be talked to about æsthetic dresses, gravely listening (with only a
                        little side‐look of amusement at Hamlin or Anne) to Mrs Spencer’s strictures
                        on modern costumes, on stays, and heels, and tight waists and full skirts;
                        and she immediately set to work untrimming her frocks and making them up
                        into wondrous garments, not at all like what any æsthetic woman had ever
                        worn in her life, but queer, fantastic, delightful, neither<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7108-249"/> Greek nor medieval, but individual and quaint and
                        fascinating.</p>
                    <p>“Dressmaking, as long as only pins are required, is my one talent, my one
                        accomplishment,” she would say, when any one admired the capricious
                        garments, in which she looked sometimes like a schoolgirl, and sometimes
                        like a page in woman’s clothes, and sometimes almost like a little nun. But
                        this was not the case. Without ever having learned, she sang with wonderful
                        charm: a small, childish, high voice, which trilled out Russian and Spanish
                        and French folk‐songs, and which had a strange, hot, passionate power of
                        singing those German songs which poor Anne, for all her fine voice (which
                        Chough used distressingly to compare with that of various equivocal singers
                        of former days) and her conscientious learning, could never succeed in
                        rendering. But the fact was that Madame Elaguine’s personality was
                        surrounded by a vague halo and shimmer of talents: she had never learned to
                        do anything, yet she could somehow do everything; she<pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7108-250"/> could write fearfully misspelt but fascinating
                        letters and bits of verse and prose; she could mimic and act.</p>
                    <p>“She is a first‐rate actress,” was one of the first things which Edmund
                        Lewis, who seemed at once singularly attracted and puzzled by her, found to
                        say about Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“You think that because she sometimes looks a little like Sarah Bernhardt,”
                        answered Hamlin, who never cared much to hear his cousin praised, since
                        everything which was praised in her seemed to point to a deficiency in
                        Anne.</p>
                    <p>“I think she is an actress because I see it,” answered Lewis, in his positive
                        way. “For my part, I don’t think any of you half appreciate all that there
                        is in Madame Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>“A nice little kittenish, intelligent flirt; just the same as a hundred
                        Russian women one has known,” said Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Lewis shook his head.</p>
                    <p>“That woman is not a mere ordinary flirt. She has an almost unique
                        temperament: she is a first‐rate medium; I feel it.”</p>
                    <pb n="253" xml:id="VAB7108-251"/>
                    <p>“You have felt so many people to be first‐rate mediums, Mr Lewis,” said Anne,
                        scornfully. “Do you remember, you thought once that I was one.”</p>
                    <p>“So I did. But this time I’m not mistaken;” and he gave Anne one of those
                        looks of fierce aversion which, loathing him as she did, she rather liked
                        from the little painter.</p>
                    <p>However, Lewis proved right this time. Madame Elaguine had scarcely ever
                        heard about spiritualism, but she threw herself into it with all her Russian
                        ardour, and in a very short time, under Lewis’s guidance, became a great
                        adept. Lewis declared that he had never met so gifted a medium in his life;
                        and, indeed, Madame Elaguine showed a perfectly marvellous power of going
                        off into trances, reading thoughts, and otherwise communicating with
                        spirit‐land.</p>
                    <p>A young doctor, one of Marjory Leigh’s hygienic demigods, whom she brought to
                        call on Anne, once met Madame Elaguine at Hammersmith. Anne noticed the way
                        in which he<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7108-252"/> watched her face and manner;
                        she seemed somehow to interest him as a problem.</p>
                    <p>“Why were you staring so at Mr Hamlin’s cousin?” asked Marjory Leigh when the
                        Russian had left.</p>
                    <p>“Staring at her?” answered the Professor, vaguely.</p>
                    <p>“She is a very pretty woman, and very charming,” said Anne; “I think that is
                        sufficient explanation.”</p>
                    <p>“Well,” said the young doctor, a rough, brusque creature, “that wasn’t
                        exactly the reason. I was thinking how very—well, to put it plainly—how very
                        hysterical a subject that lady looks.”</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean by hysterical?” said Anne, quickly. “She is very nervous,
                        but she doesn’t seem to me to be at all subject to any kind of fits.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s not what <emph>we</emph> mean by hysteria,” exclaimed the doctor.
                        “Hysteria isn’t a fit of hysterics; it is a condition of morbid nervous
                        excitability, usually accompanied by a certain<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7108-253"/> loss of will‐power. Hysterical subjects are a
                        kind of milder mad men and women; their characters undergo curious
                        modifications; they haven’t the same responsibilities as others. I wonder
                        whether that lady is not a spiritualist,—she looks like it.”</p>
                    <p>“She has let Mr Lewis, who has gone in a good deal for that sort of thing,
                        mesmerise her once or twice,” answered Anne. “I don’t believe in that
                        rubbish myself.”</p>
                    <p>“Nor do I. But there is this much of truth in it, that some sorts of
                        temperaments are naturally inclined to it, and that it reacts upon them. And
                        I should think it would be the case with that lady.”</p>
                    <p>“But surely,” hesitated Anne, “people who are in good health—who have never
                        had any kind of nervous illness or shock—don’t get into that state.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes, they do. It is often hereditary; one or two, or even sometimes only
                        one, depraved ancestor will do it for you.”</p>
                    <p>The recollection of all she had heard of<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7108-254"/>
                        Sacha’s horrible profligate old Russian father, of her violent and weak and
                        constantly ailing mother, flashed across Anne. And then came also the
                        remembrance of those portraits at Wotton Hall—of those generations of weak
                        and depraved planters, who had been the grandfathers and granduncles of
                        Sacha as well as of Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>And any remaining ill‐will which Mrs Macgregor’s stories had left was swept
                        away. Anne did not like Madame Elaguine, in the same way that she liked the
                        Leighs or even Mrs Spencer; but she felt a sudden strong compassion for her.
                        Perhaps, she thought, there is more goodness in the world than I guessed.
                        And it seemed to her that this giddy little woman, with her passionate
                        desire for the welfare of her children, this woman who had struggled through
                        the disadvantages of hereditary weakness and corrupt training, was a sort of
                        a hero.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                    <p><hi>AUTUMN</hi> turned to winter, and at last Hamlin’s long‐expected,
                        much‐talked‐of book of new poems made its appearance. In her gradual
                        estrangement from Hamlin, in the gradual replacing of the ideal creature
                        whom she had so fervently loved by a reality by which she was beginning to
                        be repelled, Anne had hung some of her last hopes to Hamlin’s poetry. She
                        would often say to herself that, after all, Hamlin made no pretence to being
                        anything more than an artistic nature; that he was a great artist, born to
                        give the world a certain amount of pleasure, and that she had no right to
                        ask of him to be anything else. What could she, willing as she was to
                        sympathise and to work,—what could a <pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7108-256"/> man
                        like Richard Brown, with all his self‐sacrificing energy and ability, do for
                        mankind that might compare with what had been done by Leonardo, by Mozart,
                        by Keats—men as solely artistic as Hamlin? and Hamlin <emph>was</emph> a
                        great poet, and would become a greater one—of that Anne felt persuaded, for
                        his work was steadily improving, and there were things in this book which
                        she recognised as having the highest merit. So she clung to Hamlin’s poetry
                        as to an anchor for his nobility and for her affection. At length the volume
                        was published. Hamlin arrived at Hammersmith one morning and placed a copy
                        of it by the side of Anne’s plate at breakfast.</p>
                    <p>“It is the first copy,” he said, “and as such, belongs to you.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” said Anne, flushing with pleasure; for, opening the book, she
                        found on the fly‐leaf a little poem, imitated from the love‐songs of the
                        Tuscan peasants, in which Hamlin dedicated the volume to her; it was
                        beautiful and simple and almost solemn—the<pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7108-257"/>
                        very flower of that distant and poetic love which he professed towards
                        her.</p>
                    <p>“You have put in the ‘Ballad of the Fens’ after all! Oh, thank you so much,
                        Mr Hamlin! You know I always thought it the best thing you have ever done,”
                        she exclaimed.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer; perhaps because he was aware that this “Ballad of the
                        Fens,” rewritten under the influence of Dennistoun, was not the same as the
                        one which he had torn up three months before. Anne soon discovered it:
                        reading through the still uncut sheets, she found that instead of the story
                        of married love, which had called down the wrath of the whole school, Hamlin
                        had set in his beautiful descriptions a ghastly tale which she scarcely
                        required more than to glance at. So this was all that had come of her having
                        mentioned Cold Fremley to him!</p>
                    <p>“I think I have made the story more tragic and more in harmony with the
                        surrounding nature. I always felt that I needed some more powerful and
                        terrible situation. Like this,<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7108-258"/> I think the
                        effect is sufficiently worked out, don’t you think?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” said Anne, icily. There was the description of the sunset on the fens,
                        of the broad slow river flowing between low green banks, its clotted masses
                        reflecting the red sunset embers; the description of the whole scene as they
                        had witnessed it; and then a description of the people of Cold Fremley, of
                        their lives and sins, in which she could almost recognise her own words in
                        which she had vainly pleaded for them that memorable afternoon in his
                        studio. A cold terror prevented Anne from turning at once to the sonnets.
                        But after all, had he not, as it were, promised to abide by her choice? had
                        he not submitted, however reluctantly, to the condemnation of those twelve
                        sonnets? Anne felt ashamed of her own suspicions and fears; she boldly
                        turned to the end of the book, peeped between the leaves—</p>
                    <p>“Desire—XII. Sonnets.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not know what was the feeling<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7108-259"/>
                        which filled her. She had never felt it before. It was too cold to be
                        indignation, too self‐possessed to be horror: she seemed surrounded by an
                        icy atmosphere, through which she saw Hamlin as through a mist. He had
                        broken his word, and for what? To attribute to himself vicious thoughts and
                        feelings which he had never had. Anne said not a word; the man who was
                        capable of acting thus could not understand if he were chidden for it.</p>
                    <p>Breakfast passed gloomily, talking little, or of indifferent things. Hamlin
                        was evidently ruffled by this reception of his book.</p>
                    <p>“Are you going to sit to me this morning, Miss Brown?” he asked with some
                        irritation, as he rose from table.</p>
                    <p>“I will, if you wish me to.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s voice smote him as if he had opened the window to a snowstorm.</p>
                    <p>“Have you anything else to do?”</p>
                    <p>“I always have plenty to do, you know. If you don’t want me, I shall go out
                        with Marjory Leigh.”</p>
                    <pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7108-260"/>
                    <p>“So much the better. I don’t feel as if I could work successfully this
                        morning, and I should be sorry to detain you for nothing at all. I will go
                        and ask my cousin whether she would care to see Lewis’s studio. This weather
                        is very depressing.”</p>
                    <p>“Very,” answered Anne.</p>
                    <p>Anne went out with Marjory Leigh, who was on a round of visiting poor people
                        at Lainbeth. They were joined by Harry Collett. He stood in great awe of his
                        future bride’s superior wisdom and dogmatic manner; but it was touching to
                        see how completely these two creatures—the shy and mystical curate, and the
                        masterful and rationalistic young woman, who was wont to tell him that some
                        day he should be persuaded that only secular work was really useful, and the
                        Church ought to be disestablished—understood each other, and sympathised in
                        their best endeavours.</p>
                    <p>“Hamlin has brought out a new book,” said Collett to Anne. “How proud you
                        must be, Miss Brown! he has been quite another man,<pb n="263" xml:id="VAB7108-261"/> twice as cheerful and devoted to his art, since
                        he has known you. For a poet like him, so sensitive and easily depressed, it
                        must be a great thing to have a noble woman to encourage him.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer. She felt alone—alone as in a desert, without an ear to
                        hear her, or a hand to touch hers.</p>
                    <p>Often did that sensation recur to her now; a sensation as of dragging wearily
                        and alone along an ice‐bound road, under a grey wintry sky, weary and
                        solitary, but with the knowledge that the more solitary and weary she felt,
                        the more was she bound to plod on. Things that happened seemed spectral.
                        Here in London she saw less of Hamlin than in the country; he was going
                        about with his friends, he was at his cousin’s. She did not know or care
                        where. People talked a great deal about the new book; and only Anne was
                        silent.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t like Hamlin’s new book,” said Richard Brown to her one evening,
                        fixing his eyes upon her in his ruthless way. He came often now; he had
                        apparently got to believe in<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7108-262"/> her, and he
                        even held out a possibility to her, if she continued to work steadily,
                        reading and attending lectures, that she might by the summer‐time be able to
                        offer herself to teach the elements of political economy at the Working
                        Women’s Club.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t like Hamlin’s new book.”</p>
                    <p><corr>It</corr> was not a question, but an assertion, and Anne felt it as a
                        taunt.</p>
                    <p>“I like some things in it extremely,” she answered boldly; “but I dislike and
                        disapprove of some others.”</p>
                    <p>Brown made a characteristic upward movement with one of his big black
                        eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>“I thought that you æsthetic folk never disapproved of anything—that it was
                        against the canons of art to disapprove.”</p>
                    <p>“I am not an æsthete, Richard. If I were, I should not be trying to learn the
                        things in which you take interest.”</p>
                    <p>“True. And does Hamlin know that you dislike and disapprove of some of his
                        poems?”</p>
                    <p>For a moment Anne did not answer.<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7108-263"/> Brown’s
                        question was like an insolent attempt to see into her heart. Yet what right
                        had she to hide anything?</p>
                    <p>“He knows exactly what I think about all his poems; but he does not,
                        naturally, agree with me in all my views.”</p>
                    <p>She was determined to keep her cousin at a distance. He had hated her ever
                        becoming connected with æsthetic society, and he tried to force her to admit
                        that she regretted it.</p>
                    <p>But Brown had an inveterate hatred which he could not put aside.</p>
                    <p>“Have you seen the review in the ‘Saturday Gazette’?” he asked.</p>
                    <p>The review was one of the few bad ones which Hamlin’s book had had, among a
                        chorus of good ones. But it was written by a rabid enemy of pre‐Raphaelite
                        poetry; and who had taken the occasion of this book to show up what he
                        considered the pestilent moral condition of the whole school.</p>
                    <p>“Yes; I have. It is a very unjust and violent attack, and quite
                        indiscriminating.”</p>
                    <pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7108-264"/>
                    <p>“So I thought. Still, what it quoted from the sonnets called
                            <bibl><title>Desire</title></bibl> seemed, so far, to bear out its statements. What do
                        you think?”</p>
                    <p>“I think,” answered Anne slowly, and choking her pride and emotion, “that all
                        he says about those sonnets is quite correct. I think it is most regrettable
                        that they should have been published. But I think that in writing them Mr
                        Hamlin was merely following the vicious traditions of his school; and I know
                        that he is, in reality, a perfectly pure‐minded man. And,” she added, as if
                        to put an end to the conversation, “he is the man to whom I owe more
                        gratitude than any woman ever owed to any man.”</p>
                    <p>Brown did not press the conversation. He understood. He had of late been
                        getting to comprehend Anne’s character; he recognised her serious
                        unselfishness, her indomitable desire for good; he saw in her a strange
                        straining dissatisfaction—a something which was as the beating of a bird’s
                        wings against its cage. And now he understood whence it came.</p>
                    <pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7108-265"/>
                    <p>“She has made her choice and must abide by it,” he said sternly to himself,
                        remembering that scene when he had tried vainly to dissuade her from
                        accepting Hamlin’s offer, and she had answered, “I love him!” “She has sold
                        her soul into bondage, and must accept the isolation and silence and
                        uselessness of a slave.” But then, as he said good night and looked at that
                        noble face, whose tragic intensity of rectitude was now revealed to him,
                        Richard Brown could not help feeling a pang. “Poor child!” he said to
                        himself; and wished he had proved less of a prophet than he believed himself
                        to have done.</p>
                    <p>He began, in consequence, to feel a little ashamed of himself, and came
                        oftener to see Anne. He was a brilliant man when you got him on his own
                        subjects, warm‐hearted, self‐sacrificing, ambitious, eloquent; and he had
                        always a number of practical schemes at heart. Originally a hand at a
                        foundry, he had for some time, like Anne’s father, been smitten with
                        communistic theories; but instead of<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7108-266"/> being
                        tempted into becoming a socialistic demagogue, he had, when he was about
                        twenty‐five, given up the little workman’s newspaper, of which he was editor
                        and chief author, and deliberately set to work studying economical and
                        social questions in the intervals of his work, carefully suspending his
                        judgment during the while. To a man as impetuous and ambitious as Brown, to
                        whom the easy and tempting path of party leader lay open, such a course must
                        have meant a terrible and long‐sustained effort of self‐control. But his
                        indomitable conscience and will had carried him through it; and now he was
                        reaping the unexpected reward of his forbearance. While slowly working his
                        way in business and studying the subjects which were dearest to him, he had
                        managed also to cultivate a mechanical genius, which seemed in some way
                        hereditary in the family of Anne’s father, who, in happier circumstances,
                        might perhaps have been a brilliant inventor instead of a starving
                        expatriated workman. He had made valuable improvements<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7108-267"/> in the foundry of which he had become the foreman, and had now,
                        for the last two years, been the chief partner and virtual director of the
                        business, with a fair livelihood in the present, and a large fortune and
                        great influence in the immediate future. But money and influence were
                        nothing to Richard Brown; or rather, influence to him meant merely the
                        triumph of his own philanthropical schemes. Selfish he undoubtedly was, but
                        his selfishness, his vanity, his pride, his ambition, were drafted off into
                        the service of others. Anne listened with enthusiasm, but not unmixed with
                        sadness, to her cousin’s projects for educating the lower classes, for
                        bringing home to the upper classes their own responsibilities; they had the
                        charm of dreams, but of the dreams of a man who seemed able to make what he
                        desired into reality. Even in this æsthetic society, which had looked upon
                        him with suspicion and loathing, Richard Brown got a certain importance. He
                        would spend hours with old Saunders the painter, and<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7108-268"/> his daughter, the enthusiastic Mrs Spencer,
                        discussing the way of introducing more beautiful patterns into trade, and of
                        getting up schools of design and loan exhibitions for the poorer
                        classes.</p>
                    <p>“He is a man of the middle ages!” Mrs Spencer would enthusiastically exclaim;
                        “if only we had a few more like <emph>him</emph>, we should soon build
                        cathedrals and town‐halls like those of the fourteenth century.”</p>
                    <p>“He is a canny Radical,” answered her father, “but a gude sort of man. For my
                        part, I don’t much believe in educating the lower classes up to art, but
                        there’s no harm in trying, and, at least, we shall get better‐made chairs
                        and tables for our money.”</p>
                    <p>Chough was equally enthusiastic. Richard Brown was anxious to get up some
                        concerts at a kind of workman’s union at which he presided; and Chough—yes,
                        the great Chough himself, who hinted mysteriously that his father (who was
                        an apothecary at Limerick) was a duke, but that he would rather die<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7108-269"/> than succeed to the title—was prevailed
                        upon to take the musical direction upon himself. While these schemes were
                        going on, Madame Elaguine met Richard Brown.</p>
                    <p>There was something in this big, burly, rather brutal man, which immediately
                        fascinated the nervous little Russian woman: she sat at Brown’s feet, she
                        listened with rapture to his theories, she threw herself headlong into the
                        plan of the concerts; she offered to perform, to teach, to do whatever Brown
                        might wish.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was thoroughly disgusted with his cousin Sacha, who had hitherto known
                        no divinity save him and pure beauty, when he saw her devoting herself to
                        humanitarianism, personified in what he called “that shoddy philanthropical
                        black brute.” He became vehemently devoted to Anne. He seemed to repent of
                        his book. He declared himself sick of London and of æsthetic society.</p>
                    <p>“I must turn over a new leaf,” he said. “I feel I must, or sink into being no
                        better than Chough or Dennistoun. But I am too weak<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7108-270"/> to turn it over alone. Will you help me, Miss
                        Brown?”—and he looked at her with his slow, beautiful glance of Platonic
                        love.</p>
                    <p>Anne smiled sadly. “No one can help any one, I am beginning to fear; and I
                        least of all.” She had got so accustomed to these sudden returns of
                        Hamlin’s, to these false starts, these longings after a healthier moral and
                        intellectual atmosphere, which came to nothing. She saw so plainly the
                        hopeless weakness and thinness of his nature; and yet in such moments she
                        could not help feeling some of that old love for this beautiful, delicate,
                        idealistic, chivalrous creature whom she knew to be mere selfishness and
                        vanity. If only he would remain thus at least.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps you are right,” answered Hamlin, leaning over the piano at which she
                        was seated; “but I feel myself sick of this life, this poetry. All is false,
                        false, hollow, and empty. My verses are untrue, my pictures are mere
                        Christmas cards; even with you as a model, I feel I am always repeating the
                            same<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7108-271"/> wearisome insipid trick of eyes,
                        and mouth, and neck. Oh, I don’t know what to do!”</p>
                    <p>It was but too true. That school of mere beautiful suggestion, which scorned
                        reality and mechanical skill as a bird scorns the ground, was fast sinking
                        into nullity. Anne had often remarked it in comparing the works of various
                        masters; she had noticed the stray sentences, not meant for her, dropped by
                        painters of other schools.</p>
                    <p>“Go to Paris and study for a year or so under Bastien‐Lepage, or Henner, or
                        Duran,” she said, with a smile at the vanity of her own words.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin could not even conceive that she was in earnest, that any one could
                        dream of seeing anything in modern French painting, that any one could be so
                        mad as to think of <emph>his</emph> studying.</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” he cried, “that is the only art that can live in our day! Ours is a
                        mere phantom; our poetry is a phantom; they come round us imploring us to
                        give them life, like<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7108-272"/> the ghosts round
                        Odysseus’s trench. But who shall give them life? Where shall we get the
                        life‐blood of passion whereon to feed and revivify them?”</p>
                    <p>And he suddenly turned round and looked at her with great yearning eyes.
                        Hamlin was genuinely unhappy, though he did not guess that his unhappiness
                        was due to vacuity, to slighted vanity, to the sudden infatuation of Madame
                        Elaguine for a shoddy philanthropist. He longed for passion as, in hot
                        climates, after months of faint sultriness, one longs for rain and wind; and
                        he looked at Anne as one might watch the dark clouds hanging on the hills,
                        the dark clouds which hold the storm for which one is thirsting. Oh for a
                        strong passion!—it would revive him, revive his art. Hamlin did not say it
                        to himself in so many words, but he felt it.</p>
                    <p>He talked long and vehemently about the necessity of going outside one’s
                        self, of transmuting one’s consciousness into that of another, of having
                        something beyond one’s self to<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7108-273"/> live for.
                        He told Anne, always with those yearning eyes fixed upon her, that what was
                        wanted to revive the world and art (and by the world he meant himself) was
                        passion; but not the mere sultry passion which his school had sung about,
                        which merely enervated and sent to sleep, but the clear cold air, the
                        whirlwinds and thunderstorms of ideal love—of love such as Dante had felt
                        for Beatrice, and Heathcliff for Cathey. It was very eloquent and beautiful
                        what he said about this love, which was something vague and quite unselfish
                        and outside one’s self,—a sort of act of adoration and purification and
                        renunciation,—a meeting of two souls which vibrated in unison in their
                        desire for the good and the noble. While he spoke, Anne almost believed that
                        he was sincere; sincere, indeed, he was, but according to his nature, not
                        hers. She felt the tears coming into her eyes, and a vague wish to throw
                        herself into his arms and implore him to cast aside his selfish habits, to
                        live for the life of other men and<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7108-274"/> for her
                        love, came to her heart. But when, suddenly, their conversation was
                        interrupted by the entry of Edmund Lewis and Madame Elaguine, it all ebbed
                        back, till her whole nature seemed to burst. She felt that he did not know
                        what he was saying, what he did not comprehend what he was wanting; she felt
                        the uselessness of saying to this man that the world and herself were
                        waiting for him to love them, that her whole nature was sickening for want
                        of one with which to vibrate in harmony of desire for the good and the
                        noble. Cold Fremley, the sonnets, a hundred little words and looks which had
                        made the chasm between them, returned to her. She felt once more alone,
                        terribly and hopelessly alone.</p>
                    <p>And still, when she met her cousin Dick, and realised how different he was,
                        how genuine and strong and passionate for good, she could not help
                        experiencing a sort of repulsion from him, and a melancholy, hopeless
                        throwing of herself back on to the unreal Hamlin.<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7108-275"/> She felt that Richard Brown, with all his
                        nobility and energy of nature, would never have done for her what Hamlin had
                        done, would never have been for her what Hamlin had been; that he would
                        never have singled her out, her a mere servant, and guessed that in her
                        there was a soul which could love and could aspire. But after all, why had
                        Hamlin singled her out? and what had he guessed in her, what had he hoped
                        from her? That line of Rossetti’s, which Hamlin admired more than any other,
                        which he so often quoted— <quote>
                            <l>“Beauty like hers is genius,”—</l>
                        </quote> returned to her with a chill; and she felt that Hamlin wanted, expected
                        from her that sort of passion which he had spoken of to revive him and his
                        art. It seemed to her as if she had been sold in the slave‐market, and were
                        being told “now love.”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
                    <p><hi>RICHARD BROWN</hi> did not let Madame Elaguine sit at his feet very long.
                        After about a fortnight of extremely assiduous visits at the Russian lady’s
                        house at Kensington, during which he poured out to the enthusiastic little
                        woman all his philanthropical schemes, Richard suddenly gave up calling, and
                        even avoided meeting Madame Elaguine at other houses.</p>
                    <p>“Why have you deserted Madame Elaguine so suddenly?” asked Anne of her
                        cousin. To confess the truth, Anne was rather malicious in her question. She
                        had speedily recognised the vanity, or rather the self‐sufficiency, the
                        belief in his own irresistible uniqueness, which was the leaven of Cousin
                        Dick’s virtues, and she had been amused from the first at seeing<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7108-277"/> how this earnest philanthropist had let himself
                        be caught by Madame Elaguine’s conscious or unconscious instinct of
                        flirtation; and now, she thought, Dick has suddenly awaked from his dream of
                        having fascinated and converted her. Anne smiled as she asked the question,
                        but there was sadness as well as amusement in her smile. In his way—his
                        blind, self‐satisfied, unselfish way—Dick was as vain as Hamlin: wherever
                        she looked vanity and hollowness met her, and she herself could not even
                        conceive what vanity was.</p>
                    <p>“Why have you deserted Madame Elaguine?” repeated Anne.</p>
                    <p>Brown suddenly raised his big, rough, black head from the review which he had
                        been mechanically looking at, and answered, looking straight in front of
                        him—</p>
                    <p>“Don’t speak to me about Madame Elaguine; she is an odious woman.”</p>
                    <p>There was something brief and silencing in his tone which surprised Anne and
                        precluded further questions.</p>
                    <pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7108-278"/>
                    <p>“In fact,” added Richard Brown, “if it were not that a woman like you will
                        never even understand what Madame Elaguine is made of, I should peremptorily
                        say that she is not a person for you to know.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was indignant, and yet, at the same time, a little shocked.</p>
                    <p>“Why, what has Madame Elaguine done?”</p>
                    <p>“Done!” answered Brown, half waiving the subject, and half insisting upon it,
                        as self‐important men frequently do. “Why, she has <emph>done</emph>
                        nothing. But that makes no difference; she’s an odious woman.”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed bitterly. The whole world seemed so awry, every one seeing
                        everything through the crooked spectacles of his own vanity. Now here was
                        Dick insinuating evil against a woman because he had been such a big baby as
                        to fancy her in love with him.</p>
                    <p>“Men are very unjust!” cried Anne; “they always trump up some mysterious sin
                        to justify their unreasonable aversions.”</p>
                    <p>Brown reddened, and was on the point of<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7108-279"/>
                        saying something. But he checked himself, and merely remarked—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, of course women always fancy that they understand each other better than
                        a man can.”</p>
                    <p>“So they can! A woman can always understand another woman better than a man
                        can, who attributes all sorts of nasty masculine faults to women, or
                        suspects imaginary feminine ones, when he doesn’t see clear. Oh yes, I know:
                        every woman is weak, vain, a creature of impulse and passion, something
                        half‐way only between the man and the child, as I read in a French paper,
                        with a kind of sham character, like the backbones of cartilage or jelly of
                        some lower creatures!”</p>
                    <p>Brown shook his head.</p>
                    <p>“Most women are like that, but not all; not you, Anne, for instance.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” answered Anne, scornfully.</p>
                    <p>“But all women, at least all noble women, are unable to judge of other women.
                        How should they judge? It is only a man, or a<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7108-280"/> base woman, who knows of the mud out of which
                        many women, like many men, are moulded.”</p>
                    <p>“One does not need to be base to know that,” said Anne, half to herself; and
                        she thought of the mud which she had discovered in her own silver idol.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think we are alluding to the same thing,” said Cousin Dick, turning
                        off the conversation.</p>
                    <p>“Mere vanity, and the injustice of vanity,” said Anne to herself, and her
                        pessimism became more confirmed. But later, although she continued to
                        believe quite equally in Richard Brown’s vanity, she began to suspect that
                        there had been in this coarse‐looking man a movement of modesty, an
                        unwillingness to let her eyes rest upon some nasty thing which he had seen.
                        But of this, at present, she had no idea, and Madame Elaguine, although she
                        did not find much in common with her, became for Anne another victim of the
                        vanity and injustice of the world.</p>
                    <pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7108-281"/>
                    <p>They saw a good deal of the little woman now. Anne thought she understood her
                        thoroughly, and owned to herself that she had not understood her at first.
                        She recognised that the little woman had much more character than she had at
                        first imagined; and the impression of frailness, childishness, and
                        helplessness which something in Madame Elaguine’s appearance, manner, and
                        voice had at first given her, wore away so completely that she could
                        scarcely believe it had ever existed. Eccentric and irresponsible she still
                        seemed, always rushing from one enthusiasm to another, always thirsting for
                        excitement; but Anne found that instead of a childish girl who could lean
                        upon her, she had to deal with a woman, undisciplined and capricious indeed,
                        but still, in many respects, more of a woman than herself. She was flighty
                        and giddy like her own little girl in many respects, and fully as ignorant
                        of many things; but she had a knowledge of sides of life which Anne
                        instinctively guessed, and from which she recoiled<pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7108-282"/>. With an extraordinary love of the beautiful, the fantastic, and
                        the ideal, which, as it made her dress herself in queer <foreign xml:lang="fre">ingénue</foreign> little costumes, also made her mould
                        her conduct, ideas, and words rather theatrically in obedience to a
                        conception of something striking and pretty,—Madame Elaguine had, at the
                        same time, a vein—no, Anne thought it must be a mere exterior dab, not due
                        to her inner nature, but to her Russian and Continental education—of
                        coarseness, which surprised and pained Miss Brown. Once or twice, in Anne’s
                        presence, she alluded to things in a manner which gave Anne a shock; and
                        Anne, who, half Italian as she was, and wholly fearless and unprudish, would
                        ask herself what right she had had to feel like that; she would analyse
                        Madame Elaguine’s words, and find them, when measured by a Continental
                        standard, very harmless; yet somehow, though she told herself that she was
                        stupid and unjust, something of the painful impression would remain. Also,
                        she could not conceive<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7108-283"/> how a woman could
                        like to sit for hours, as Madame Elaguine did, on the score of spiritual
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">séances</foreign>, with a man like Edmund Lewis.
                        She never heard him talk on anything objectionable to the Russian; and yet
                        there was something to her inconceivable in the endurance of this man by a
                        young woman. Anne came to the conclusion that she must be growing horribly
                        prejudiced and unjust; and the less she could sympathise with some of Madame
                        Elaguine’s tastes (though there was nothing really objectionable in them)
                        the more did she force herself to try and understand, and make allowance
                        for, and help the little woman. And one day Anne’s sympathies were really
                        enlisted for her.</p>
                    <p>It was about Christmas, and Anne had prevailed upon Hamlin to accompany her
                        and Madame Elaguine to a pantomime, to which the Russian was taking her
                        little girl, and Anne the two Chough children. Anne amused herself heartily,
                        as she always did, at every sort of theatrical performance, with the love<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7108-284"/> of shows and acting in her Italian blood;
                        she was so happy laughing with the children, while Hamlin talked with his
                        cousin and Chough in the back of the box, that that evening long remained a
                        sort of oasis in the dreariness of her inner life. There was a tremendous
                        crush in the lobbies and on the stairs;. and while Chough shoved on his two
                        children, and Hamlin tried to make way through the crowd for his frail
                        little cousin, who looked as if she would be knocked over and trampled like
                        a feather, Anne, towering through the throng (and people turned to look at
                        that magnificent pale face, set in crisp black hair, and said to each other,
                        “Look there; that’s Miss Brown, the famous pre‐Raphaelite beauty”), held
                        Sacha Elaguine’s little girl close in front of her, calmly making the crowd
                        divide as a ship divides the water. They were fairly out of the theatre, on
                        the steps looking out into the street, with the gas burning dim in the fog,
                        and the long splashes of yellow light on pavement and wet cab‐tops,<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7108-285"/> waiting in the damp cold, while Chough
                        called their carriage, and Madame Elaguine, leaning on Hamlin’s arm, the two
                        little Choughs by her side, had heaved a sigh of relief, and exclaimed—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, how delicious it is to be in the cold, and fog, and dark, after that
                        theatre!—”</p>
                    <p>When little Hélène Elaguine, who was holding Anne’s hand, and see‐sawing from
                        one leg to another—while staring at the men in opera hats and comforters,
                        and the ladies and children huddled in furs, and the policemen and cabmen
                        who passed in front—suddenly gave a piercing shriek, and threw herself into
                        Anne’s arms, clinging to her and burying her head in her pelisse.</p>
                    <p>“Good heavens! what’s the matter, child?” cried Anne, mechanically clasping
                        the little girl round the waist.</p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter?” cried Hamlin, who had not seen this action.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine had let go his arm and darted forward, white as ashes,
                        and seized<pb n="288" xml:id="VAB7108-286"/> her child from Anne, and
                        cried—“Let us go! let us go!” in an agonised voice.</p>
                    <p>The carriage came up, and she jumped into it, scarcely giving Hamlin and Anne
                        time to follow, and leaving Chough and his children amazed before the
                        theatre door.</p>
                    <p>The carriage stopped at her door in Kensington.</p>
                    <p>“I cannot pass this night alone with only Helen and the servants! I cannot, I
                        cannot!”</p>
                    <p>And Madame Elaguine burst into tears, strangely intermingled with hysterical
                        laughs.</p>
                    <p>“They want to take my child away; they are trying it again!”</p>
                    <p>“What is to be done?” asked Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“I will stay to‐night with Madame Elaguine,” said Anne, with decision; “if
                        you will go to Hammersmith and tell Aunt Claudia’s maid that your cousin was
                        feeling ill, and I am staying with her till to‐morrow. Help Madame Elaguine
                        out, will you?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin lifted his cousin out of the carriage, while Anne took charge of the
                            child,<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7108-287"/> whom its nurse carried up in a
                        condition of lethargic sleep.</p>
                    <p>When they were in Madame Elaguine’s drawing‐room, the Russian took the child
                        in her arms, and flinging herself on a sofa, burst out crying, her sobs
                        interrupted by moaning complaints that some one wanted to take her child
                        away.</p>
                    <p>“I will go to Hammersmith now, and leave you with her,” whispered Hamlin to
                        Anne, who had knelt down by the side of the sofa.</p>
                    <p>“I will come to‐morrow morning for news; good night.”</p>
                    <p>“Good night,” answered Anne, under her breath.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine heard. She started up, and looking wildly about—</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don’t leave me alone yet!” she cried.</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown will remain, Sacha,” said Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, don’t leave me yet, Walter!” repeated<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7108-288"/>
                        Madame Elaguine. “I am afraid—I am afraid of Miss Brown.”</p>
                    <p>“I think you had better remain, Mr Hamlin,” whispered Anne; “she will
                        probably be quiet in a minute or two.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin took a chair near the table, and looked on in surprise. Madame
                        Elaguine was stretched on the sofa, her sleeping child pressed close to her;
                        her little head, with its short pale curls, thrown back; her eyes half
                        closed, moaning and gasping and sobbing; and Anne, kneeling by her side,
                        looking anxiously into that curious, convulsed face.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think she is going to faint?” asked Hamlin of his cousin’s Swiss
                        maid, who stood by, the picture of self‐satisfied composure.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no—Monsieur need be under no apprehension. Madame often had <foreign xml:lang="fre">de ces crises</foreign>; Madame was often frightened like
                        that. It was the first time since Madame was in England, but it was quite
                        common. Madame,” added the servant quietly, “has probably seen her black
                        man—”</p>
                    <pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7108-289"/>
                    <p>“What black man?” asked Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>Sacha Elaguine had suddenly raised herself on her elbow,—as if she had heard
                        the maid’s words.</p>
                    <p>“Take Mademoiselle Hélène to bed, Sophie,” she said quietly.</p>
                    <p>“Shan’t I take her?” asked Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Sophie knows how to manage her,” answered Madame Elaguine; and sitting up,
                        she drew the half‐wakened child close to her and kissed her with convulsive
                        passion. Yet she let the maid carry off the little one, and merely let
                        herself slip down on the couch with a moan, putting aside her heavy fur and
                        passing her hands through her pale blond hair, and moaning.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t you think you had better go?” said Anne to Hamlin. “I will look after
                        your cousin.” She would loathe to have Hamlin sitting there, looking at her,
                        if she were in Madame Elaguine’s condition.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin rose.</p>
                    <p>“Stop a minute,” said his cousin faintly,<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7108-290"/>
                        turning round and fixing her vague northern blue eyes on him; “stop a
                        minute, Walter.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin remained standing, his eyes involuntarily fixed upon the curious
                        spectacle of this prostrate little figure, panting and gasping as if going
                        to die, and half unconscious of any one’s presence—her cloak thrown back on
                        the sofa, her hair tangled, her bare arms and neck (for it was one of her
                        caprices always to go the play, even to the pantomime, full dress) half
                        covered by the fur of her pelisse and the lace of her dress.</p>
                    <p>“Stay a minute; I want to explain,” repeated the Russian, in a faint voice.
                        “Anne—dear Anne—where are you?”</p>
                    <p>“Here I am,” answered Anne, in her cheerful strong voice; “do you want
                        anything, dear Madame Elaguine?”</p>
                    <p>“I want <emph>you</emph>,” and Sacha flung her arms round Anne’s neck, and
                        drew her dark head close to her own little pale yellow one. Anne felt her
                        arms tighten passionately round her, her little hand tighten convulsively
                        round her<pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7108-291"/> neck, as if the half‐fainting
                        woman would throttle her,—but she felt no fear, only a vague, undefinable
                        repulsion. Madame Elaguine sighed a long sigh of relief, and loosened her
                        hold; but she kept Anne’s face near hers, and kissed her with hot lips on
                        the forehead.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Anne,” she said, “forgive me.”</p>
                    <p>“There is nothing to forgive,” said Anne, trying to get loose and to rise to
                        her feet. But Madame Elaguine kept her down in her kneeling posture, her arm
                        always round Anne’s shoulder.</p>
                    <p>“I must explain it all to you,” she said, in a slow, vague tone, fixing her
                        eyes upon Hamlin. “Don’t think me very foolish or mad; but I thought they
                        were again trying to carry off my little Helen,—they have tried before,—and
                        they keep writing to me, telling me that they will carry off Helen or kill
                        me. I don’t care about that,—but Helen!” and Madame Elaguine hid her face in
                        Anne’s iron‐black hair.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin looked on as in a dream. It was a<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7108-292"/>
                        curious sight, these two women, so different, and yet both so young and
                        beautiful, the one clinging so to the other; and of the two, Madame
                        Elaguine, whom he had never thought regularly handsome, with her thin,
                        strange face, and red lips, and wild eyes, seemed to him at this moment the
                        stranger and more beautiful of the two.</p>
                    <p>“I want to explain it all,” said Madame Elaguine. “Walter, give me that
                        box—the little Indian inlaid one on the writing‐table—there, next to the
                        palm‐tree.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin brought the box; and Madame Elaguine, without letting go her hold of
                        Anne, pressed a spring and opened it. It was full to the brim of
                        letters—some large and folded in their envelopes, others mere scraps of
                        paper. She took some out, and spread them on her knees.</p>
                    <p>“Look,” she said, letting Anne go, so that she could, while still kneeling,
                        see the papers.</p>
                    <p>Anne raised herself, and Hamlin approached.</p>
                    <p>“Look at these,” said the Russian, carefully<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7108-293"/> handling the soiled and crumpled pieces of paper; “these are to me what
                        love‐letters are to other women,—they are my life—my past, and my future.”
                        And she fixed her eyes wildly on Hamlin. “As other women have lived on
                        knowing that they were loved and would always be loved, so I have lived,
                        ever since I was twenty, knowing that I was surrounded by invisible enemies,
                        who would either put a sudden end to my life or protract it with their
                        tortures. Ah! I know you think me giddy, and fickle, and childish; but you
                        don’t know that I try to lose my wits in order that I may gain some peace!”
                        her voice burst out hot and passionate.</p>
                    <p>Anne and Hamlin were shyly fingering the papers; they were all in the same
                        hand—a curious, crabbed, left‐handed character—some in French, some in
                        English, some in Russian, but all brief and to the same purpose: initials of
                        which neither Anne nor Hamlin understood the meaning at the head, and below
                        a threat of something terrible, sometimes left vague,<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7108-294"/> sometimes outspoken, as death, to what was styled
                        the traitress. Many of them said that what could not be visited on the
                        mother should be visited on the children, and all concluded with saying that
                        wherever the traitress went she would be followed by invisible eyes and
                        footsteps.</p>
                    <p>“It was all my fault in the beginning,” began Madame Elaguine, covering her
                        eyes with her hands; “but I was very young, ignorant, and lonely; and after
                        all, what harm did I do? I had been married when I was only seventeen to a
                        man whom I thought of as a father; and little by little, when I found what
                        sort of man he was—how base, and coarse, and cunning—I began to feel very
                        lonely and empty‐hearted. I was too young to care for my children, who were
                        babies, and I was a baby myself. But it was all so lonely, and the world so
                        mean about me. I longed to be of some use, and able to sacrifice myself for
                        something. And a man was sent across my path, twice as old as myself, whom I
                            looked<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7108-295"/> upon as a father, and who
                        treated me as a child; and this man used to talk to me, when my husband left
                        me all alone to run after low women, and tell me all about the miserable
                        condition of Russia, and how all the good was being stamped out, and only
                        selfishness, and injustice, and corruption triumphed. He was a Nihilist
                        himself, and one of their chief men—a wonderful man, who seemed so cold, and
                        just, and honest. So, little by little, he converted me to his ideas, and I
                        got to know other Nihilists, men and women, and heard a great deal about all
                        sorts of terrible doings. I felt so happy and heroic—I was a fool, you see.
                        Then I suddenly discovered that my hero was quite different from what I
                        thought—that he had gained all this power over me only in hopes of making
                        shameful use of it, and had cornpromised me with his party merely to make me
                        his mistress. When I understood it, I drove him away, and threatened to tell
                        all to my husband; and then he swore to get the better of me, and to use all
                        the power of his society to<pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7108-296"/> bring me, as
                        he called it, to reason. For two years, while my husband was alive, I
                        struggled with him, and he kept on threatening and hoping to frighten me.
                        But when my husband died, I sold all the Russian property, and was preparing
                        to leave the country, and then that man who hated me, just because in his
                        way he had loved me, denounced me to his society as a traitor to the
                        Nihilist cause, and as a person to be hunted down. And so, ever since, I
                        have been persecuted with all the might of the Nihilists wielded by this
                        man; and although I have been hundreds of times on the point of denouncing
                        him and his associates to the Government, I have never done so, because I am
                        still a Nihilist at heart, and hate the Russian Government as much as I hate
                        him; and he, who knows it, knows I cannot defend myself, and employs his
                        power in tormenting me.”</p>
                    <p>A convulsion passed across Madame Elaguine’s face; it dropped, like that of a
                        dying person. But she started up suddenly, and went on with her story. For
                        ten years nearly she had been<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7108-297"/> persecuted
                        in this mysterious way; threatening letters had come to her by all manner of
                        conveyances,—brought by the post, found on her table, dropped by invisible
                        hands at her feet. Attempts had been made to poison her, stopped just in
                        time to let her know of them—for the object seemed rather to make her life
                        unbearable than to take it away; burning spirits of wine had been poured
                        under her door; twice she had been shot at. But the most terrible part of
                        the persecution had come when they had discovered her passionate love for
                        her little girl (the boy, now at school, they had somehow let alone).
                        Several times, in various places (for she was always on the move, flying her
                        enemies), attempts had been made to carry off the child; once, at Cannes,
                        she had gone to the window just in time to see a man snatch up the child,
                        who was playing in the garden, and to fire off a revolver at him.</p>
                    <p>“If I had killed my child,” said Madame Elaguine, savagely, “it would have
                        been better than to see her carried away from me.”</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7108-298"/>
                    <p>The individual who had made these attempts she described as being very dark,
                        as if his complexion had been altered by overdoses of nitrate of silver. And
                        this man would every now and then, at unexpected moments, reappear, and his
                        reappearance meant some fresh outrage. Poor little Helen had suddenly seen
                        him, or thought she had seen him, among the crowd coming out of the theatre;
                        and this had produced the child’s sudden fit.</p>
                    <p>“Ever since I have come to London,” said Madame Elaguine, “I have been
                        comparatively quiet. I was almost forgetting all about my misfortunes, or
                        thinking I was forgotten—and here it begins afresh;” and she burst into
                        tears.</p>
                    <p>“Oh why, why cannot I be permitted to be happy for a little while—only a
                        little while?” she cried.</p>
                    <p>Anne had listened awe‐stricken. She had always thought there was something
                        mysterious about this giddy little woman. This frightful undeserved calamity
                        struck down her<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7108-299"/> imagination; what right
                        had she ever to feel unhappy in the presence of such misery as this?</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps,” she suggested timidly—“perhaps it may have been Helen’s fancy. As
                        she is used to the idea of this black man, she may have imagined, being
                        tired and overexcited from the play, that she saw him among the crowd.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, no, it was he, really he,” moaned Madame Elaguine, turning over on
                        the sofa and burying her face in its cushions.</p>
                    <p>“You must go now,” whispered Anne to Hamlin; “there is no earthly use in your
                        staying. I will sit up with her till she be quiet. Good night.”</p>
                    <p>“Good night;” and Hamlin, as he noiselessly opened the door, cast a last
                        glance at that singular group in the rose‐coloured light of his cousin’s
                        lamp,—Sacha, with her fur and lace all in disarray, gasping on the couch,
                        her bare throat heaving, and one of her thin white arms hanging loosely by
                        her side; and Anne<pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7108-300"/> Brown, in her long
                        plain white dress of high art simplicity of cut, stooping over her. For some
                        time Anne sat by Sacha’s side, holding the Russian’s hot hand.</p>
                    <p>“Is Walter gone?” suddenly asked Madame Elaguine, turning her head.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin went some minutes ago.”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine raised herself and sat up on the sofa, and passed her little
                        hands through her disorderly yellow hair.</p>
                    <p>“Give me a kiss, Annie,” she said.</p>
                    <p>Anne stooped down and kissed her.</p>
                    <p>“Perhaps I had better go to bed now,” said Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“Shall I help you to undress?” asked Anne, who feared that Hamlin’s cousin
                        might have another fit of hysterics.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no; call Sophie—she will undress me.”</p>
                    <p>On Anne’s call, the Swiss maid emerged from the next room.</p>
                    <p>“Put me to bed,” ordered Sacha, rising and leaning on the arm of the
                        sofa.</p>
                    <pb n="303" xml:id="VAB7108-301"/>
                    <p>“May I really not help you?” asked Anne, for the maid looked so indifferent,
                        nay, so sulky, and she seemed to handle her mistress so roughly, that Miss
                        Brown wondered how Madame Elaguine, in her state of nerves, could endure to
                        be helped by her.</p>
                    <p>Anne waited till Madame Elaguine was in bed.</p>
                    <p>“I have made up the bed for Mademoiselle in the spare room,” said the maid,
                        looking at Anne with a curious insolence; and she led her up‐stairs. Anne
                        did not put out the lamp, and she did not undress. She could not sleep; and
                        she felt miserable at the notion of Madame Elaguine being left all alone on
                        the first floor. What if the little woman should wake up with a panic, if
                        she were to fancy that some of her mysterious persecutors were hiding in her
                        room? Anne took the lamp, and silently descended into the drawing‐room. All
                        was quiet. She sat down in an arm‐chair, and made up the dying fire. She
                        felt very restless and unable to sleep. The whole scene<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7108-302"/> of this night and Sacha’s revelations had shaken
                        her nerves and gone to her imagination. In her half‐drowsy, dreamy
                        condition, everything seemed to her strange and eerie in this room, which
                        was so unlike her own at Hammersmith. It was full of pretty things, but in
                        great confusion; Sacha’s piano was still open, with a book of Rubinstein’s
                        songs on it. There was a heap of dog’s‐eared French novels and recent
                        volumes of poetry on the table, and the whole room was heavy with the scent
                        of some Eastern drug and of Madame Elaguine’s Turkish cigarettes. On the
                        table by Anne’s side were some books: she took up one, and opened it at
                        random; it was Hamlin’s new volume. At the head of the page was the title,
                        “Desire—XII. Sonnets,” and all along the margin was a faint line in pencil,
                        and the words, in a childish hand, “How beautiful! and how <emph rend="sc">TRUE</emph>!”</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> notion that a man was waiting, thirsting for her love, would
                        have been enough for many a woman in Anne’s position—many a woman more
                        gifted than Anne, and more conscious of her gifts, especially if the man who
                        thus tacitly implored her to love and kindle love in him, were, like Hamlin,
                        the former object of passionate worship. But with Anne Brown it was
                        different. Some few women seem to be born to have been men, or at least not
                        to have been women. To them love, if it come, will be an absorbing passion,
                        but a passion only of brief duration, the mere momentary diversion into a
                        personal and individual channel of a force which constitutes the whole moral
                        and intellectual existence, whose object is an unattainable<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7108-305"/> ideal of excellence, and whose field is the whole of the world in
                        which there is injustice, and callousness, and evil. Such women may be very
                        happy if they love a man with their eyes open—love him as a mere secondary
                        concern, as a mere trusty companion in the struggle after the ideal; but if
                        they love in a man what momentarily seems to be that ideal, if they love
                        with all the force of their nature, a terrible reaction of vacuity and
                        despair must soon come. As with their lovers and husbands, so also with
                        their children: they cannot blissfully concentrate all their passion upon
                        them; such love will soon become narrow and bitter for them. They are indeed
                        sent into the world (if any of us is ever sent for any purpose) to be its
                        Joans of Arc—to kindle from their pure passion a fire of enthusiasm as
                        passionate, but purer than it is given to men to kindle: they are not
                        intended to be, except as a utilisation of what is fatally wasted, either
                        wives or mothers. Masculine women, mere men in disguise, they are not: the
                            very<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7108-306"/> strength and purity of their
                        nature, its intensity as of some undiluted spirit, is dependent upon their
                        cleaner and narrower woman’s nature, upon their narrowness and obstinacy of
                        woman’s mind; they are, and can only be, true women; but women without
                        woman’s instincts and wants, sexless—women made not for man but for
                        humankind. Anne Brown was one of these. She had no idea that she was of this
                        strange, rare stuff of heroines; she had no notion that she was at all
                        superior to the ordinary run of her sex; indeed it was her perfect ignorance
                        of her own exceptional nature which caused most of her wretchedness, making
                        her at once more impatient with the weakness of others, and more impatient
                        with her own difficulty of being satisfied. Love, therefore, was not for her
                        a happiness, nor an ideal, nor even a compensation. In an intensely earnest
                        nature like hers, a few years are worth a lifetime: everything is
                        understood, endured much sooner; all that can be felt, for pleasure or pain,
                        is rapidly exhausted, and the character remains<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7108-307"/> early, with all its human lusts and vanities
                        burnt out like the gases in green wood, ready to become the fuel for
                        unindividual ideal passion. So at twenty‐three, Anne had, so to speak, loved
                        out her love, her passionate adoring love, as she had dreamed out the dreams
                        of her life; anything that might still come would be but a faint momentary
                        flicker of sentiment, a detail in her life, and no more.</p>
                    <p>So when Hamlin had, in his veiled way, made her to understand what he hoped,
                        what he desired, what he expected, what (she could not help saying to
                        herself) he had bargained for, of her,—the thought of this love, which she
                        could no longer feel, and which she was expected to give—of this love which
                        was to be merely the highest selfish pleasure, the most precious (because
                        the most refined), æsthetic lust of a selfish æsthetic voluptuary, Anne
                        experienced a sense of horror and self‐debasement. So this was what Hamlin
                        was waiting for—this which made him play that comedy of respectful distant
                        adoration, of freedom of<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7108-308"/> choice in her, of
                        absence of all rights in himself—this that her solid mass of soul should
                        slowly take fire, and smoulder, and, leaping up in inextinguishable flame,
                        set him also ablaze.</p>
                    <p>Hitherto Anne had been unhappy from her isolation, from her gradual discovery
                        that the man whom she had loved as an ideal of nobility must be scorned as a
                        mere weak‐spirited and morbid‐minded artistic automaton,—a mind creating
                        beautiful things from sheer blind necessity, as a violin gives out beautiful
                        sounds, but soulless, like the mere instrument of wood and string. She had
                        been unhappy because she was alone, terribly alone; but now she was unhappy
                        because she had discovered that she was in bondage, surrounded by walls, a
                        slave. And now that she yearned for the icy sense of isolation with which
                        she had lived a few weeks back, as a prisoner in a fortress might yearn for
                        the desert, she found also that she could no longer drift on indifferent,
                        enduring the present, and hoping for the future. She could no longer vaguely
                        say to<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7108-309"/> herself, as she had so often said
                        before, that Hamlin might be redeemed, that he might yet become once more an
                        object of her love: for it had become plain to her that her future was
                        settled; that whatever Hamlin was, he was her master, her proprietor; and
                        that, lovable or not lovable to her nature, he expected, counted upon her
                        love.</p>
                    <p>This new feeling made Anne’s life—that life which was so completely a life of
                        the world within, not of the world without—insupportable in a new way.
                        Isolated she could live, but not caged. Her whole soul sickened; she no
                        longer thought of trying to influence Hamlin, of trying to help others; all
                        her energies were concentrated upon helping, upon freeing herself.</p>
                    <p>“There is something the matter with Anne Brown,” said Sacha one day to her
                        cousin. “What is it?”</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown always looks very serious,” answered Hamlin, affecting
                        indifference. “She has a tragic sort of face even when she is quite<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7108-310"/> happy. It is one of her great
                        peculiarities, and to me her charms; but for some time I could not realise
                        that she was really happy.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s not it,” cried Madame Elaguine, impatiently. “I know Anne when she’s
                        happy and Anne when she’s unhappy. She doesn’t look merely grave and tragic
                        as she used to—she looks perplexed, and pained, and worried; she’s not happy
                        in her life.”</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown,” said Edmund Lewis, in his drawling, clammy voice, fixing his
                        conquering eyes on Madame Elaguine with a quiet, insolent smile—“Miss Brown
                        is a woman, although she looks like a goddess; and even goddesses, you know,
                        could not help being women too.”</p>
                    <p>The Russian laughed. “Always the fatuity of these men!” she cried, and turned
                        contemptuously on her heel.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin did not answer, but a feeling of satisfaction came over him. Anne was
                        unhappy; and in a nature like hers, he said to himself, love must be
                        unhappiness. But when he saw Lewis and his cousin alone he felt<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7108-311"/> annoyed; and he fell upon their spiritualistic
                        practices with a perfect rabidness of scorn.</p>
                    <p>Anne little knew that she was watched; she did not care what might or might
                        not be thought of her by Sacha Elaguine, by Chough, by Edmund Lewis, by any
                        of these people whom she despised; and as to Hamlin, an instinct told her
                        that he would never guess what it was that troubled her. So Anne kept her
                        pain to herself; but sometimes the despair of being thus enslaved became too
                        strong for endurance, and she longed for some one to whom to confide it.
                        Every word, every look, every piece of attention, every show of indifference
                        on Hamlin’s part, seemed to mean the same thing: that he expected her to
                        love him—everything seemed to allude and point to that. The only women with
                        whom she was at all really intimate were the Leighs; but Anne could not say
                        a word to them, could not ask their advice. She could never, she thought,
                        make either of these girls enter into her situation, comprehend her
                        feelings, make<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7108-312"/> her understand that she was
                        not ungrateful, and that Hamlin was not ungenerous. Yet she felt the
                        terrible need of some one to counsel her—to take some of the frightful
                        responsibility either of ingratitude or of degradation from off her—to show
                        her either how to get out of the situation, or how to submit to it. Such a
                        person there was—a person who might help her, who might even understand her;
                        but something told Anne that she must not have recourse to him, to her
                        cousin Dick. Perhaps it was vanity, perhaps a knowledge that Richard Brown
                        would triumph over this miserable ending to what he had always opposed; a
                        fear lest he might misunderstand Hamlin, and bespatter what was the one
                        beautiful thing in his life—his raising up of Anne. For it was a curious
                        point that, contemptible as Hamlin had become to Anne, and unworthy in her
                        own eyes of her love, she could not endure the idea of any one else
                        understanding this, of any one else attacking Hamlin. None of them, she
                        felt, could understand what<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7108-313"/> Hamlin had
                        done for her; what he had been—nay, what, as a beloved piece of the past, he
                        still was—to her; only she could measure what she owed to him, and only she,
                        therefore, might weigh the bad in him against the good. For even when she
                        was most overcome with the sense of the moral prison which was closing round
                        her, to cripple her life and break her spirit, Anne could not wish that the
                        past had been otherwise—that she had never met Hamlin, never contracted a
                        debt towards him, never loved him. Bleak and dark as might be the present,
                        she would not ever have given up that past,—that sudden flaming up of her
                        life, that one spell of hope and trustfulness, and admiration and love,
                        which must serve her for all her existence: to have had that was always
                        sweet, to have been given it was always a reason for gratitude. Moreover,
                        Anne could not now contemplate what she would have been had she never met
                        Hamlin. To her stern and idealising nature, to have remained without
                        knowledge, without<pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7108-314"/> responsibility, without sympathy, without sense of right or wrong,
                        morally only half developed, only half alive, as she had been during her
                        earlier girlhood, was unendurable. She would not, for all the pain and
                        humiliation which it might cost her, have forfeited the finer fibre, the
                        clearer vision which had shown her that she was indebted therefor to a man
                        whom she despised. No; she could not, even in thought, relinquish the past.
                        But what of the future? The question laid hold of Anne’s mind, and for some
                        weeks rode it like an incubus. How many of us have thus let a hopeless
                        problem get hold of our whole nature, and make it move, day after day, week
                        after week, in the frightful treadmill of its vicious circle?</p>
                    <p>Every night Anne lay down to sleep with her doubts half solved, her mind half
                        made up, only to wake up the next day with all her doubts reinforced and all
                        her resolutions scattered. Such a condition is not due to weakness or
                        indecision of character; nay, it is<pb n="318" xml:id="VAB7108-315"/>
                        probably only the earnest minds, the most capable of serious decisions, who
                        can thus go on living in suspense, resisting the temptation of a decision,
                        enduring the monotonous recurrence of a struggle of motives and of thought;
                        it is the effort, this frightful mental instability, at retaining moral life
                        where life would easily be extinguished; it is the weary tramp up and down
                        with cold cramped limbs of the prisoner who knows that were he to stop, were
                        he to lie down, he would have rest, but also death. Almost unintentionally
                        Anne kept asking herself what steps she could take to be free. She used, in
                        moments of weakness and weariness of heart, to go over schemes of
                        independence, to indulge in day‐dreams of self‐supporting liberty. She who,
                        a few months ago, had dreamed of raising the lower classes, of spreading
                        higher knowledge and ideals among them, of awakening the more fortunate
                        parts of society to their sense of responsibility,—she whose whole energy
                        had been taken up in silent projects for bettering, no matter how<pb n="319" xml:id="VAB7108-316"/> little, the world, bettering the poor by making
                        them think and enjoy, bettering the rich by making them feel; giving the
                        shop‐girls of the Women’s Club a glimpse into the world of imagination, and
                        giving Hamlin a glimpse into the world of reality,—she was now thinking of
                        how she might earn her bread, how she might live as a teacher or a
                        governess. Talking with the Leighs and her cousin, she used shyly, and with
                        a desire to deceive very foreign to her, to put questions, seemingly purely
                        abstract, as to what a poor girl with a certain amount of education could
                        best do—as to what was required of a schoolmistress or a governess. And,
                        while telling herself that it was all useless—that she was bound by the
                        past, however much she might try and cut herself loose from the present—Anne
                        mechanically gave her time to studying, no longer to be more worthy of
                        Hamlin, or more useful in the world, but to enable herself to gain a
                        livelihood if . . . Ah! well, when she asked herself plainly what that “if”
                            meant,<pb n="320" xml:id="VAB7108-317"/> she had to answer that she
                        scarcely knew: if the slave‐owner should say to his slave,“ Go—I am tired of
                        you;” if the man who had bought the precious statue or picture should weary
                        of it and wish to exchange it. And Anne had to admit to herself that Hamlin
                        was not the man to feel or act like this. Nay sometimes, when she had
                        indulged in a day‐dream of freedom—when she had let herself go to the vain
                        belief that Hamlin would one day awaken to the sense that this woman was not
                        his ideal, as she had awakened to the sense that he was not hers—when she
                        had worked out the details of her half‐starving life of independence, her
                        return to her old drudgery (but with a freer spirit), her hard struggle as a
                        teacher of little children, or a shop‐girl, or at best a schoolmistress,—the
                        recollection of the past would suddenly overpower her—the recollection of
                        what she had been, what she had hoped—the recollection of her love of that
                        debt which she was now devising a means of paying off,—and poor Anne would
                        burst into tears. But that debt, she<pb n="321" xml:id="VAB7108-318"/> felt,
                        could not be paid off. She might support herself in the future, but how
                        could she get rid of the past? If she lived on dry bread for the rest of her
                        life, Hamlin would still have done for her what she believed that no other
                        man had ever done for a woman; if she could save up every penny of earnings
                        and place before him all that he had ever spent for her education, would it
                        not be the basest, vilest mockery and cheat, and could she repay the love
                        which he had felt, the trustfulness which he had shown? Repay it she never
                        could; for love and trustfulness she could not give in return; and she must
                        ever remain in his debt, remain his to do his bidding. And yet at times the
                        question arose in her, What right had she to pay a debt at the price of her
                        honour? To become Hamlin’s wife when she did not love him, to pretend love
                        which she did not feel, this was in Anne’s eyes, measured by her stern
                        measure of right and wrong, a prostitution; and could it be honourable to
                        let herself be dishonoured? But Anne cast<pb n="322" xml:id="VAB7108-319"/>
                        this thought behind her; Hamlin, by binding only himself and leaving her
                        free, had by his chivalrous generosity really bound her; if to possess her,
                        and as much of her life and love as she could give, would make Hamlin happy,
                        he had a right to it.</p>
                    <p>The strain, Anne felt, was becoming too much for her; this question of her
                        own future, of her own dignity and undignity, was swallowing up her whole
                        nature, neither more nor less than the nature of Hamlin and his friend was
                        swallowed up by their æsthetical feelings. Anne recognised, with terror,
                        that she was deteriorating; that she was beginning to care nothing for
                        others in this preoccupation about herself; and that such a thing should
                        happen—that she too should lose her more generous feelings—was a greater
                        degradation than any other which could come over her. This shame and this
                        misfortune alone it was in her power to prevent, and she determined to
                        prevent it. She did her best to put aside all questions of her own future,
                        to accustom herself to wait for<pb n="323" xml:id="VAB7108-320"/> what might
                        happen, what she might be summoned to do, and she threw herself with more
                        ardour than ever (trying to escape from the contamination, not merely, as
                        before, of the selfishness of others, but of her own) into such studies and
                        questions as concerned wider interests than her own.</p>
                    <p>Anne’s earnest nature, lacking the happy faculty of being absorbed by present
                        feelings, had always been very subject to a dull moral pain at the evil in
                        the world, storms from the great Sahara of misery which would lower over her
                        own oasis of happiness, clogging its atmosphere and blighting its greenness.
                        But now her efforts not to brood over her own unhappiness, resulted merely
                        in her brooding almost unceasingly over the unhappiness of others. And
                        gradually, to the sense of the misery of the world, became superadded the
                        terrible sense of the injustice of that world’s arrangements: from being
                        indignant with the callousness of men, Anne became indignant, with the same
                        cold and sombre indignation,<pb n="324" xml:id="VAB7108-321"/> at the
                        callousness of God. She felt herself alone, isolated, separated not only
                        from the men and women surrounding her, but separated in spirit from the
                        whole scheme of things. And to her, the greater part of whose life was in
                        her aspirations, this gradual removal of anything to which to aspire, this
                        gradual destruction of every ideal with which to sympathise, such a
                        condition of moral loneliness was, as Anne once said to her cousin, worse
                        than death.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown had somehow, that day, been more sympathising with Anne than
                        usual. Had she not been too much engrossed, she might have noticed that he
                        watched her face, listened to her words, not merely now with gentleness and
                        friendliness, but with a kind of suppressed admiration and wonder.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing is so bad as death,” answered Richard; “because, once dead, we can
                        no longer feel, we can no longer judge, or sympathise, or strive.”</p>
                    <p>Anne looked up from the frock which she<pb n="325" xml:id="VAB7108-322"/> was
                        making for one of the little Choughs, whose wardrobe was getting into a
                        lamentable condition.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean that we are so useful when we are dead, but we are less
                        unhappy. You talk of feeling, and sympathising, and judging, and striving:
                        what can we feel, and sympathise with, and judge, except the miserableness
                        of men, and their weakness and badness, and the horrible arrangement of the
                        world which makes them such? and after what can we strive, except vainly to
                        release ourselves from that abominable order of the world?”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown looked at Anne for a moment in silence. He was a singularly
                        unæsthetic man, and confusing beauty with mere utility, he had never well
                        understood the beauty which artistic people chose to see in this strange,
                        uncommon, sombre face, so unlike that of any one else, and which seemed to
                        have no prototype either in man or woman. But now he felt that Anne was
                        beautiful, and very beautiful.</p>
                    <pb n="326" xml:id="VAB7108-323"/>
                    <p>“All mankind is gradually releasing itself from what you call this evil
                        arrangement of the world,” he answered; “or rather, the very perception that
                        such an arrangement is evil is teaching mankind,—I mean all that much of
                        mankind which makes the rest move on, to rearrange the world, and out of the
                        bad to make the good.”</p>
                    <p>Anne shrugged her shoulders contemptuously.</p>
                    <p>“Why was the arrangement made if it was evil?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“Because,” said her cousin, watching her face as he let his words
                        drop—“because there was no sense of good and evil at the beginning; because
                        it is only man who has conceived that the pleasure of others is good, and
                        the pain of others is evil; and because, therefore, only man can be expected
                        to reorganise the world so that the good of others be sought and the evil of
                        others avoided. It is only man living with men, and feeling their miseries
                        in his own, and their happiness in his own, who can be<pb n="327" xml:id="VAB7108-324"/> anxious for justice and impatient of injustice.
                        How can you expect it of nature?”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer, but remained for a moment with her hands folded over her
                        work, looking out of the window. Outside there was only yellow fog, and
                        leafless spectral branches; yet her onyx‐grey eyes opened slowly, as if she
                        were taking in some faint but glorious vision.</p>
                    <p>“What right have you to expect such feelings except from men and women?” went
                        on Brown; “the gods, you know, have other things to do. I suppose,” he added
                        bitterly, “that they had a godlike life like their representatives, the
                        poets and artists, on earth, creating only for their amusement, and keeping
                        every disagreeable sight, or sound, or feeling, or suspicion away from
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was accustomed to such hits at Hamlin; they were too true to be refuted,
                        and too spiteful to be accepted; and now she was too much absorbed to notice
                        any of them.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know exactly what you are driving<pb n="328" xml:id="VAB7108-325"/>
                        at, Dick,” she said. “I don’t understand your theory about man and God, and
                        right and wrong; it is misty to me. But still it seems—I don’t know how—as
                        if, could I only understand it, it would make a great difference to me.”</p>
                    <p>“It must make a great difference to every honest person. You have no
                        religion, Anne.”</p>
                    <p>“No. I thought religion was all bosh; merely a sort of silly pretty delusion,
                        like love and all that;” and Anne thought bitterly how her own only
                        religion, her love for Hamlin, her desire to become worthy of his goodness,
                        had lamentably betrayed her.</p>
                    <p>“Without religion life is death,” said Brown, with his positivistic
                        solemnity.</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at him contemptuously; she had so often heard people talk
                        solemnly like that. Did not Hamlin talk in that way about the religion of
                        beauty, and Dennistoun about the religion of love, by which he meant
                        lust?</p>
                    <p>“It is all very fine; but I don’t much believe<pb n="329" xml:id="VAB7108-326"/> in religions. There is nothing worth worshipping; all is fetish,
                        at best half silver and half clay.”</p>
                    <p>“You don’t believe in any religion, Anne, because you have never tried to
                        find one.”</p>
                    <p>“I have looked in the Gospel, and in the ‘Imitation of Christ,’ and in my own
                        heart, Dick; and what I have found there is ignored in the scheme on which
                        the world is made; because I have read there of love and justice and mercy,
                        and I have not found the love and justice and mercy which presided over
                        creation.”</p>
                    <p>“I told you that the world was not made by man, and that it is man who has
                        conceived good and evil. I always told you, Anne, that it was a great pity
                        that you should read only books upon details of science, like political
                        economy and so forth, and refuse to get general ideas of what is and what is
                        not the belief of our age.”</p>
                    <p>“Detail knowledge—I mean knowledge of political economy and physiology and so
                        forth—is useful; it can be applied, it can serve to<pb n="330" xml:id="VAB7108-327"/> make people a little less wretched. What is the
                        use of your general ideas? Oh, I know; the religion of truth, the worship of
                        ideas, &amp;c., &amp;c. I don’t see that it is a bit nobler to
                        worship truth than to worship beauty; your religion of science is only
                        another form of selfish æstheticism: your friends hanker after knowledge, as
                        my friends hanker after beautiful pictures, and music, and poetry, and
                        women; and as my people dignify their appetites with the name of religion of
                        beauty, so do yours sanctify theirs as the worship of truth. All that merely
                        makes the world more cold and black in my eyes.”</p>
                    <p>“These general ideas,” answered Brown, “are what prevent me from being as
                        wretched as you are. Do you call that useless?”</p>
                    <p>“That is just what Mr Hamlin says about beauty, and Chough about the Eternal
                        Feminine. But I don’t see that the world gains by this devotion.”</p>
                    <p>“I know nothing of Hamlin’s or Chough’s<pb n="331" xml:id="VAB7108-328"/>
                        opinions,” interrupted Brown, impatiently; “but I know that if you permit
                        yourself to continue in this kind of pessimism you will enervate your soul,
                        Anne. It seems very noble and austere, and all that sort of bosh; but there
                        is just the same fascination in it as there is in any morbid excitement, and
                        just the same debasement of the individual in indulging therein.”</p>
                    <p>His words seemed to go through Anne. Was she becoming selfish, weak,
                        self‐indulgent? The terror of it sickened her. And was everything, however
                        noble it seemed—love, beauty, nay, even her indignation at the world’s
                        evil—only a snare?</p>
                    <p>“Will you teach me, Dick?” she said, after a moment. “I don’t much believe in
                        your religion—positivism, I suppose it is—for all religions seem to me to
                        turn out, oh, so empty, after promising so much. But if you will tell me, or
                        give me books to read, you know I will do my best to understand.”</p>
                    <p>“You are a noble girl, Anne,” said Brown<pb n="332" xml:id="VAB7108-329"/>
                        half audibly, fixing his eyes on Anne’s. “I did not think there was a woman
                        so strong, and truthful, and fair‐minded as you—well—in the whole
                        world.”</p>
                    <p>“You always think people base, Dick,” she answered sadly. “It is a wretched
                        mistake, but not so bad a one for yourself as always to think them
                        noble.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown lent Anne a number of books, and he often came of an evening
                        when Hamlin was gone to Madame Elaguine’s spiritual <foreign xml:lang="fre">séances</foreign> (for despite his scepticism he found himself
                        attracted by the mysticism with which Edmund Lewis had easily infected his
                        cousin), and talked them over with her. He took her also to hear the
                        lectures of a friend of his, a red‐haired young man of genius, dying of
                        consumption, who had for truth and righteousness a passion such as other men
                        may have for sport, and who was the chief preacher of the secular and
                        scientific religion with which Brown was imbued, and with which he was
                        seeking to imbue Anne. Anne<pb n="333" xml:id="VAB7108-330"/> was not so
                        quick in being converted as her cousin had expected; she was slow of
                        thought, and her earnestness, her honesty, perhaps also a painful
                        remembrance of so many other deluded hopes, made her sceptical. But, little
                        by little, Anne was converted; and, as her cousin had foretold, she was
                        happier. The world and its contradictions became simpler in her eyes, and
                        she became once more confident of good. Moreover, what Brown never guessed,
                        her new faith in the triumph of right, her new belief in the necessity of
                        doing one’s duty for the sake of mankind and of progress, had at once given
                        her a more serene determination to accomplish her duty towards Hamlin; and,
                        what was more important, it had taken away her thoughts a little from her
                        own position of impotence and isolation and probable degradation. And
                        perhaps, unconsciously also to Anne, she felt less isolated now: she felt as
                        if in this rough, brutal, vain philanthropist, who was so honest, for all
                        his petty vanity, and who was so desirous<pb n="334" xml:id="VAB7108-331"/>
                        of her good, despite all his former contemptuousness, she had gained what
                        she had never had, and had yet always vaguely wanted,—some one for her to
                        understand and to understand her, to help and be helped by—not an ideal
                        being to adore as she had adored Hamlin, but a good, wholesome, strong
                        reality whom she could love as a brother.</p>
                    <p>“I owe a great deal to you, dear old Dick,” she said one day, taking his
                        hand; “I am so glad I would not let you continue to despise me.”</p>
                    <p>Brown flushed, and his cynical smile failed him. “Despise you? Oh Anne, how
                        could I—” he exclaimed. But suddenly he checked himself.</p>

                    <p><hi>WHILE</hi> Anne was being indoctrinated with her cousin’s philosophical
                        theories, Hamlin had little by little let himself be drawn into the little
                        clique of more mystical and Bohemian pre‐Raphaelites whom Edmund Lewis had
                        collected round Madame Elaguine. The old‐fashioned, long‐established
                        æsthetes, who believed that artistic salvation resided solely in themselves
                        and their kith and kin, and who strangely muddled together the theories of
                        an esoteric school and the prejudice of the untravelled Briton, decidedly
                        set their face against Madame Elaguine. They had not liked Anne Brown<pb n="4" xml:id="VAB7109-003"/> because she was not sufficiently engaging;
                        but they thoroughly hated Sacha Elaguine because she was too
                        fascinating.</p>
                    <p>“A nasty, ignorant, frivolous little woman,” said Mrs Spencer, who was the
                        spokeswoman of the party; “a woman with no sense of responsibility whatever.
                        Did you hear the way in which she spoke of those horrible French painters?
                        That she actually dared to talk to papa about that Monsieur Page, vulgar,
                        base creature that he is!”</p>
                    <p>And the older people, and the women of the æsthetic world—the spinsters with
                        dishevelled locks and overflowing hearts, who kept little garlanded lamps
                        before the photographs of puny English painters and booted and red‐shirted
                        American poets, all agreed with her. But the younger men merely laughed, and
                        neglected the solemn, smut‐engrained parlours of Bloomsbury, the chilly,
                        ascetic studios of Hampstead, for Madame Elaguine’s curious, disorderly,
                        charming house in Kensington—the house patched up with old lodging‐house<pb n="5" xml:id="VAB7109-004"/> furniture and all manner of Eastern stuffs
                        and brocades, crowded with a woman’s nick‐nacks, strewn with French novels
                        and poems, and redolent of cigarettes and Russian perfumes. For there was in
                        this delicate, nervous little creature, eaten up with love of excitement,
                        something which acted as a spell upon most men; and it was curious to see
                        how she managed to make them all in love with her, and at the same time
                        excite no jealousy.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think Circe’s pigs were jealous of each other?” asked Mrs Spencer,
                        when this peculiarity was pointed out to her by Chough. “Reduce people to a
                        certain level, and they will be satisfied with equality.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis explained it as being due to Madame Elaguine’s magnetic power. Whether
                        the Russian had been fully converted to his spiritualistic theories, or,
                        indeed, whether it was possible to make her believe seriously in anything,
                        it is impossible to say. But she had caught the spiritualistic infection
                        from Lewis as a tinder catches fire. Nothing in the world<pb n="6" xml:id="VAB7109-005"/> could suit her better: spiritualism appealed to
                        her love of excitement and mystery, to an idealistic and mystical strain
                        which made her hanker after strange supersensuous contacts and occult
                        affinities; moreover, if ever there was a woman of whom one might believe
                        that she could vibrate with disembodied passion, and come in contact with an
                        uncorporeal world, it was this emaciated, nervous, hysterical creature, who
                        lived off coffee and cigarettes, and lived, as it seemed, only with her
                        restless mind, and not at all with her frail, incapable body.</p>
                    <p>“I feel sometimes,” she would say to her friends, “as if I mixed with the
                        living as smoke mingles with air—seeing them move before me, but unable to
                        clutch them or be clutched by them, coming in contact only with their
                        passions. I feel as if I could more easily live with the dead—mix more
                        easily with them. It is terrible. I sometimes fancy that I shall fall in
                        love with some dead creature, and my life be sucked away by him,”—and she
                        gave a little shudder.</p>
                    <pb n="7" xml:id="VAB7109-006"/>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough listened spell‐bound with admiration, twisting and untwisting
                        his long black whiskers. What a woman was this! And he ruminated over a new
                        chapter of his Triumph of Womanhood, of which Sacha Elaguine—“Sacha quite
                        short,” as she bade her friends call her—should be the heroine.</p>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis smiled his sensual lazy smile, which one knew that he imagined
                        to be the prototype of the cruel and lustful mysterious smile of the men and
                        women, and creatures neither one nor the other or both, who came from
                        beneath his fantastic pencil.</p>
                    <p>“Has it never occurred to you,” he said, in his luscious voice, stooping over
                        Madame Elaguine’s chair, “that you may rather be a dead creature yourself—a
                        vampire come to suck out some one’s life‐blood?”</p>
                    <p>“Confound that Lewis!” thought Chough. “Why must such ideas occur to him, a
                        mere damned painter, and not to me, who am a poet?” and he made a note of
                        the vampire.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was standing by, smoking his cigarette<pb n="8" xml:id="VAB7109-007"/> sullenly. He did not like these sort of liberties which Lewis took
                        with his cousin; he had even of late warned her that, although his friend
                        was an excellent fellow, too great intimacy with him might prove
                        disagreeable to her.</p>
                    <p>“What a carrion‐feeding fancy you have, Lewis!” he exclaimed, frowning. “One
                        would think you lived on corpses, in order to be more in harmony with those
                        beasts of spirits of yours.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis laughed triumphantly; but Madame Elaguine, to his amazement, cut him
                        short by saying—</p>
                    <p>“Your idea may be very amusing, Mr Lewis; but I don’t think it is exactly the
                        style of thing for a man to say to a woman.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis, who was never abashed, merely raised his eyebrows.</p>
                    <p>“I thought you were superior to your sex,” he answered.</p>
                    <p>“If Lewis dare to talk to you like that,” whispered Hamlin to Sacha, “I shall
                        horsewhip him one of these days.”</p>
                    <pb n="9" xml:id="VAB7109-008"/>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine pressed his fingers in her little hot hand.</p>
                    <p>“You are good,” she answered, in what was like the buzz of a gnat, but
                        infinitely caressing; “but poor Lewis means no harm: he is very <foreign xml:lang="fre">bon enfant</foreign>. You are too pure and proud to
                        understand other men. Ah, Anne is a happy woman!”</p>
                    <p>The last words were scarcely more than a little sigh to herself; but Hamlin
                        caught them, and reddened.</p>
                    <p>“Anne is very cold,” he said briefly; then added, as if to justify himself in
                        his own eyes—“I suppose all very passionate natures are.”</p>
                    <p>Sacha shook her little thin childish head.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no—not all.”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown went but rarely to the house of Hamlin’s cousin. She was extremely
                        sorry for the poor little woman’s misfortunes; and asking herself what she
                        would have been had she had Madame Elaguine’s past, she often admired how
                        the Russian had kept her independence and self‐respect, and serenity and
                            cheerfulness.<pb n="10" xml:id="VAB7109-009"/> Yet, while she believed
                        herself fully to appreciate Sacha, and invariably defended her against the
                        jealous prudery of Mrs Spencer and her clique, Anne somehow felt no desire
                        to see much of her. She set it down to her own narrowness and coldness of
                        temper. “I am too one‐sided to have friends,” she used to say to Mary Leigh;
                        “I feel that I don’t do justice enough to people, however much I try, and
                        that my heart does not go out to meet them enough. I think I would do my
                        best for them; but I can’t love them or be loved.”</p>
                    <p>Poor Mary Leigh was silent. Anne—this beautiful noble, distant, somewhat
                        inscrutable Anne—was the idol of the enthusiastic Irish girl. She had often
                        longed to tell her so; she longed, at this moment, to put her arms round
                        Anne’s neck, and say quite quietly—“I love you, Anne;” but she had not the
                        courage. How much may this sort of cowardice, called reticence, cheat people
                        of? The knowledge that there is a loving heart near one, that there is a
                        creature whom one can trust, that the world<pb n="11" xml:id="VAB7109-010"/>
                        is not a desert,—all this might be given, but is not. And the other regrets,
                        perhaps throughout life, that word which remained unspoken, that kiss which
                        remained ungiven, and would have been as the draught of water to the wearied
                        traveller.</p>
                    <p>Anyhow Anne, while thinking that she liked Madame Elaguine, somehow did not
                        care to see much of her. What she could do for her she did willingly. Madame
                        Elaguine wanted the child to learn English, but made a fuss about letting
                        her have a governess.</p>
                    <p>“My child’s mind must be my own mind,” she said. But as she went on grieving
                        at little Helen’s ignorance, and her own incapacity, from want of schooling
                        and want of strength, to teach her, Anne offered to teach the child together
                        with the little Chough girls, who were still her pupils. Madame Elaguine was
                        rapturously grateful; but Helen was so completely spoilt, that she could be
                        brought to Anne only when she fancied it herself, and Anne found her so
                        demoralised that she really<pb n="12" xml:id="VAB7109-011"/> did not like to
                        bring her in contact with the Choughs. “When poor little Helen is ten, then
                        you must moralise her,” Madame Elaguine would say; and Helen was within week
                        of being ten, and Anne, much as she disliked asking Madame Elaguine
                        anything, urged that she should begin to be taught. Moreover, Anne’s time
                        was too much taken up reading under Richard Brown’s directions, and her
                        thoughts were too much preoccupied to make her feel at all sociable, even
                        had she not felt an instinctive repugnance to the sort of company, headed by
                        Edmund Lewis, which she knew she would meet at Madame Elaguine’s.</p>
                    <p>However, one evening she could not refuse Sacha’s invitation, more especially
                        as the latter, evidently to please Anne, had invited her friends the two
                        Leighs. It was a grand spiritualistic <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>. Madame Elaguine was in great excitement, and Edmund
                        Lewis was radiant. But Hamlin looked bored and pressed.</p>
                    <p>“I hate all this vulgar twaddle of spiritualism<pb n="13" xml:id="VAB7109-012"/>,” he said impatiently to Anne. Anne loathed it: the triviality
                        disgusted her, the giving up of one’s will to another revolted her, and she
                        could not understand how a woman could endure to be handled and breathed
                        upon by a man like Lewis. Mary Leigh was half excited and half amused;
                        Marjory, the strong‐minded scoffer, had determined to unmask some sort of
                        trickery. The <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>, to which Edmund
                        Lewis had brought a famous professional medium, was very much like any other
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>: a darkened room, a company of
                        people partly excited, partly bored; expectation, disappointment, faith,
                        incredulity; moving of tables and rapping, faint music, half visible
                        hands.</p>
                    <p>“The whole boxful, machinery complete, all the newest tricks, eighteenpence,”
                        as little Thaddy O’Reilly fiippantly remarked to Anne. How could Madame
                        Elaguine have patience with such rubbish? wondered Miss Brown. What
                        excitement could that excitement‐loving little woman, with a real mystery in
                        her own life, find in all this stale shibboleth?</p>
                    <pb n="14" xml:id="VAB7109-013"/>
                    <p>“You can’t think what a strange, delightful sensation I have at these
                        moments,” said Sacha to Hamlin, as her little soft hand touched his. “I seem
                        to feel the whole current of your life streaming through me, and mingling
                        with mine. It is like an additional sense. Do you understand that,
                        Anne?”</p>
                    <p>“No,” answered Anne, briefly. “I feel Mr Hamlin’s fingers touching mine, and
                        that’s all.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin somehow admired Anne’s answer; he was glad it was so,—had she felt
                        like his cousin, something would have spoilt in an ideal of his; and yet
                        Anne’s coldness annoyed him.</p>
                    <p>“The spirits are reluctant; there are too many sceptics in the room,” said
                        Edmund Lewis, angrily. “Great as is the power of some of us—as, for
                        instance, of Madame Elaguine—I feel that there is something acting as a
                        non‐conductor,—some very chilly nature here.”</p>
                    <p>But nevertheless, when the company was giving up the <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign> as spoilt, mysterious sounds were heard, and something
                        luminous, which was immediately identified as a pair<pb n="15" xml:id="VAB7109-014"/> of spirit‐hands, was seen to float over the
                        table.</p>
                    <p>“Spirit‐hands!” whispered Edmund Lewis.</p>
                    <p>“Wash‐leather gloves painted over with luminous paint,” whispered Thaddy
                        O’Reilly.</p>
                    <p>“A wreath!” whispered Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>Something round, like a wreath, did seem to float, supported by the
                        spirit‐hands. Some said it was oak, others cypress, others myrtle; but it
                        soon became apparent that it was bay.</p>
                    <p>“For Hamlin!” whispered the guests to each other.</p>
                    <p>The wreath floated unsteadily over the heads of the party; but, as it passed
                        Marjory Leigh, that evil‐minded young materialist quickly snatched at it,
                        but it was whisked away by the indignant spirits. There was a murmur of
                        indignation; but indignation turned into triumph when suddenly the wreath
                        reappeared, and hovered for two good minutes over Hamlin’s head. There was a
                        cry of admiration, and Madame Elaguine clapped her hands.</p>
                    <pb n="16" xml:id="VAB7109-015"/>
                    <p>But Marjory Leigh struck a light, and lit the candle by her side. She could
                        see faintly the excited faces all round, and among them the pale face of
                        Anne Brown, scornful and angry, fixed upon that of Hamlin, who was flushed,
                        hesitating, surprised.</p>
                    <p>“I am glad the spirits have such good taste in poetry,” said Marjory Leigh,
                        quietly; “but it is a pity that they should not have crowned Mr Hamlin, like
                        Petrarch and Corinne, with real laurels.” And she stretched out something in
                        the palm of her hand. Every one crowded round, and took it up by turns.</p>
                    <p>It was a leaf, torn and broken, of green laurel which she had pulled off when
                        the crown had passed over her; but the green laurels were masses of stamped
                        paper, and left a green stain in the hand.</p>
                    <p>“It does smack a little of a French <foreign xml:lang="fre">pensionnat de
                            demoiselles</foreign> distribution of prizes; you will get the little
                        book <foreign xml:lang="fre">dorésur tranches</foreign>, ‘Avec l’approbation
                        de Monseigneur l’Archevêque de Tours,’ and ‘Prix décerné à M. Walter Hamlin<pb n="17" xml:id="VAB7109-016"/>,’ written inside, at the next <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>,” cried Thaddy O’Reilly. “Well, it is consoling to see
                        how our beloved dead keep up the simple habits of the living.”</p>
                    <p>There was a titter. Madame Elaguine burst out laughing. Hamlin laughed, but
                        he looked black as thunder.</p>
                    <p>“You brought that piece of green paper with you!” cried Lewis furiously at
                        Marjory Leigh. “You brought it to insult and delude us! It is
                        disgraceful.”</p>
                    <p>“My dear Lewis,” said Thaddy O’Reilly, gently, “remember that you are still a
                        gentleman, and not yet a spirit.”</p>
                    <p>“Had I known that there was to be any crowning, I should certainly have
                        brought something better than paper laurels,” said Marjory, fiercely. “I
                        never thought spirits were reduced to such expedients as these.”</p>
                    <p>The <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign> came to an end. The lamps were
                        lit. The medium dismissed with considerable contumely. Edmund Lewis went
                        away in a huff; and Madame Elaguine, who<pb n="18" xml:id="VAB7109-017"/>
                        cared in spiritualism only for those strange thrills which she had before
                        described, laughed a great deal about the matter, and settled down to make
                        music with Cosmo Chough.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin looked as if he wished himself a thousand miles away. He would speak
                        with no one; he was angry with his cousin for having let him in for such a
                        ridiculous scene, and angry with the rest of the company for having
                        witnessed it; he had no command over his looks; and while Madame Elaguine’s
                        curious, warm, childish voice throbbed passionately through Schumann’s
                        songs, or while people took their tea and talked, he sat aside, in the
                        doorway of the next room, like a whipped child.</p>
                    <p>“What a baby Walter is!” whispered Madame Elaguine, laughing, to Chough.</p>
                    <p>But Anne did not laugh. She felt the humiliation not of the paper laurels,
                        but of that radiant look which she had seen in Hamlin when the lights had
                        first been lit. And she was indignant with Hamlin for taking<pb n="19" xml:id="VAB7109-018"/> this ridiculous business so tragically, and at the same time sorry
                        for his poor, wounded, unsympathised‐with vanity. She left the piano, where
                        she had been sitting near Sacha, and went to him where he sat disconsolately
                        looking over a heap of newspapers in the next room.</p>
                    <p>She did not allude to the scene. What use was it chiding him? He could never
                        understand. She talked to him about the picture which he was painting, about
                        the people, anything to make him feel that she was sorry for him. Hamlin was
                        bitter against his friends; he began once more his tirades against modern
                        art and poetry, its lifelessness and weakness; he again declared himself
                        longing for a different life; he again, passionately and delicately, called
                        upon Anne, in his veiled way, to redeem him. Anne listened sadly. She knew
                        it all so well by heart, this vain talk which was to be the daily bread of
                        her soul.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly Hamlin’s eye fell upon Marjory<pb n="20" xml:id="VAB7109-019"/>
                        Leigh, who was seated talking with Thaddy O’Reilly in the recess of a
                        window.</p>
                    <p>“I wonder you can endure that girl, Miss Brown!” he cried, “much less make
                        her your friend.”</p>
                    <p>“Marjory may sometimes be rude, and it was perhaps not very good manners to
                        interrupt the <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign> as she did, although
                        I quite sympathise with her; but she is a capital girl, and just one of the
                        most trustworthy persons I know.”</p>
                    <p>“She is a humbug!” exclaimed Hamlin, crossly and violently. “Doesn’t she set
                        up for philanthropy, and self‐sacrifice, and all that? and then she goes to
                        parties dressed in that way—a fit beginning for the wife of an East End
                        curate, for a man like Harry Collett!”</p>
                    <p>“Marjory’s dress does not cost more than Harry Collett’s coats,” answered
                        Anne, quietly. “You men never understand such things, and think because a
                        girl’s dress is showy that it is expensive. Of course Marjory doesn’t wear
                        æsthetic things, and it would be absurd if she<pb n="21" xml:id="VAB7109-020"/> did; but I happen to know that she made that
                        particular dress entirely with her own hands.”</p>
                    <p>“I know nothing about the dress, except that a wife of Harry Collett’s should
                        not go about like a peacock. But I do know,” cried Hamlin, fiercely, “that
                        it is disgraceful for a girl engaged to marry, and to marry a man like
                        Harry, to sit the whole evening in a corner, letting a jackanapes like
                        O’Reilly make love to her.”</p>
                    <p>“Marjory has been sitting with Mr O’Reilly only about ten minutes,” answered
                        Anne, indignantly, “and she has known him ever since they were babies. I
                        think it is too ridiculous if a girl can’t talk to a young man at a party
                        without being treated as if she were committing an infidelity.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t say that any other girl talking to any other young man is to blame,”
                        said Hamlin, still hotly; “but I say that a woman who can let O’Reilly flirt
                        with her throughout the evening is no wife for Collett; and I have<pb n="22" xml:id="VAB7109-021"/> a good mind to write and tell him so,” and Hamlin
                        looked dignified.</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer at first. She was filled with contempt for this vain
                        childish ill‐humour, which was taking the proportions of rabid hatred.</p>
                    <p>“Marjory is my friend,” she at last said, “and I think that the less you talk
                        such nonsense as about writing to Mr Collett, the better.”</p>
                    <p>“I will, upon my word!” exclaimed Hamlin. “Marjory Leigh is a friend of
                        yours, but she is an infamous flirt all the same!”</p>
                    <p>“Why does Mr Hamlin glare at me like that?” asked Marjory of Anne a little
                        later. “One would think it was my fault that the spirits crowned him with
                        paper laurels and not with bay‐leaves.”</p>

                    <p><hi>ANNE</hi> had forgotten all about the <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign>, when, about a week later, Mary Leigh arrived at
                        Hammersmith in a state of extreme excitement.</p>
                    <p>“What is the matter, Mary?” asked Anne, wondering at her flushed face, which
                        was usually so quiet.</p>
                    <p>“Nothing—nothing,” said Mary Leigh, looking impatiently at some visitors who
                        were present. “I spoilt two copper plates this morning, and shall have no
                        etchings worth exhibiting. I suppose that has put me out of sorts.”</p>
                    <p>But the visitors had scarcely turned their backs, when Mary Leigh turned
                        suddenly towards Miss Brown.</p>
                    <pb n="24" xml:id="VAB7109-023"/>
                    <p>“Oh Anne dear, a dreadful, shameful thing has happened! and I have come to
                        you to know what it means, because I can’t help thinking that Mr Hamlin has
                        had something to do with it, and poor Marjory is so miserable.”</p>
                    <p>“What is it?” asked Anne, a vague terror coming over her.</p>
                    <p>“Why, Marjory got this letter to‐day from Harry Collett; he has been staying
                        with his mother at Wotton for the last week. Read it, and you will
                        understand.”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown took the letter, evidently much pulled about and read and re‐read,
                        from Mary Leigh, and smoothed it out and read it slowly; while her friend
                        sat by, looking anxiously at her face.</p>
                    <p>The letter was from Marjory’s intended. Harry Collett told her, with a
                        dignity and gentleness, a desire not to hurt the one who had hurt him, and
                        an incapacity of hiding his great pain, which nearly made Anne cry, that his
                        eyes had at length been opened to the undesirableness of a marriage<pb n="25" xml:id="VAB7109-024"/> which, however much wished for by him, could not satisfy all the
                        claims of a nature llke Marjory’s.</p>
                    <p>“Much as I have looked forward to our marriage,” wrote poor Harry, “I could
                        not possibly be happy if I suspected that it did not give you everything
                        which you have a right to require from life. I thank God for having sent me
                        a warning in time, for having let me understand what your generosity and my
                        infatuation would have hidden to me—namely, that your thoughts have, despite
                        your will, turned elsewhere; that your nature requires a life of greater
                        cheerfulness and variety than I could hope to give it. And, indeed, I am
                        beginning also to understand that I was trying to reconcile the
                        irreconcilable—that a man who has elected a life among the poor, has no
                        right to share its privations with any one, much less with any one dear to
                        him; and I see that I was on the verge of committing the sin of sacrificing
                        your happiness to my vocation, or rather to my unmanly desire to<pb n="26" xml:id="VAB7109-025"/> have the hardness of my vocation sweetened at
                        your expense. Please do not fancy that I think at all badly of you; I think
                        badly only of my own blindness.”</p>
                    <p>But the poor curate’s angelic nature could not resist the temptation of a
                        fling at his supposed rival.</p>
                    <p>“I am only surprised—but my surprise may be due to my ignorance,” he added,
                        “at the person who engrosses your thoughts. I should never have thought you
                        could seriously care for a shallow creature like O’Reilly. I wish you to be
                        happy, but I fear you will not be solidly happy with him.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you understand?” cried Mary Leigh, impatiently; “some one has written to
                        Harry some horrid lies about Marjory and Thaddy O’Reilly. Oh, I think it is
                        too shameful! Marjory, who has not seen Thaddy O’Reilly more than twice in
                        the last six months; and,” added Mary Leigh, with an agony in her voice, “I
                        fear—oh, I fear—Anne, that it must have been Mr Hamlin who did it.”</p>
                    <pb n="27" xml:id="VAB7109-026"/>
                    <p>Anne did not look up from the letter. She was very white, and her face full
                        of shame.</p>
                    <p>“I fear it must,” she answered, half audibly.</p>
                    <p>“But what is the meaning of it?” cried Mary. “What can Mr Hamlin know about
                        the matter? Why, he scarcely ever sees Marjory. I don’t believe he had seen
                        her for nearly six weeks before that party at Madame Elaguine’s. Oh, Anne,
                        do you think it is Madame Elaguine, that horrid little Russian, who did
                        it?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no,” answered Anne, quickly, “I know Sacha Elaguine has not done it; I
                        don’t believe she is capable of doing it.”</p>
                    <p>“Then you think? . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I fear—I fear Mr Hamlin did it.”</p>
                    <p>There was a dead silence. Poor Mary Leigh was torn by her indignation for her
                        sister, and her pain at the shame cast upon her admired Hamlin, and through
                        him upon her adored Anne.</p>
                    <p>“What can I do? If only I knew the grounds of the accusation,” she said desperately<pb n="28" xml:id="VAB7109-027"/>, “I know I could explain them away to Harry. I know that Marjory
                        could, but she won’t.”</p>
                    <p>“Has Marjory not answered Mr Collett?”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh shook her head.</p>
                    <p>“Marjory is too proud and self‐willed. She is disgusted with Harry. She won’t
                        hear his name mentioned; it is useless. Oh, it is dreadful to see people who
                        care for each other so much separated in this way, by a mere vile groundless
                        calumny, which one cannot even refute.”</p>
                    <p>Anne passed her hand across her forehead.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin has done it,” she said slowly, and with an effort, “and he must
                        undo it.”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>How</emph> can one make him undo such a thing?” cried Mary,
                        hopelessly.</p>
                    <p>“I will tell him that he was wrong, and make him write to Harry Collett.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh Annie dear, you are good”—and Mary Leigh threw herself on Anne’s
                        neck—“for I know how dreadful, how terrible it must be for you to tell him
                        that he has acted badly.”</p>
                    <pb n="29" xml:id="VAB7109-028"/>
                    <p>“It is not the first time,” answered Anne, mournfully. “Leave me the letter,
                        will you, Mary dear?”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh left the letter with Miss Brown; and that evening, as Anne was
                        sitting with Hamlin after dinner, she suddenly dashed into the subject.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remember saying, the other night, at your cousin’s, that you would
                        write to Harry Collett about the flirtation which you took it upon yourself
                        to imagine between Marjory Leigh and Mr O’Reilly?” asked Anne.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin looked puzzled.</p>
                    <p>“I remember something or other,” he said evasively.</p>
                    <p>“Did you write to Harry Collett?”</p>
                    <p>“I had occasion to write to Collett about some books I had left at Wotton,
                        and which I wanted him to bring up to town on his return.”</p>
                    <p>“But did you mention about Marjory and Mr O’Reilly?”</p>
                    <pb n="30" xml:id="VAB7109-029"/>
                    <p>“I may have”—Hamlin spoke absently—“yes, I suppose I did. What of it?”</p>
                    <p>“What of it?” cried Anne, indignantly; “why, this much, that you have made
                        two people perfectly miserable, and that Marjory’s marriage with Mr Collett
                        is broken off,” and she handed him the letter.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin looked at it with an air of puzzled indifference.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t understand what it’s all about,” he said, coolly and serenely,
                        returning the letter to Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Then you did not say anything about Marjory to Mr Collett?”</p>
                    <p>“Yes—I did—I certainly think I did. I can’t exactly remember what it was. You
                        know how one writes letters; one forgets the next day.”</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at him with wonder. So after having, momentarily at least, made
                        two people as unhappy as was well possible, this was how he took the
                        revelation of the results of his doings.</p>
                    <pb n="31" xml:id="VAB7109-030"/>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, sternly, “you know that you never believed that
                        Marjory Leigh was really flirting with O’Reilly; and you know that you wrote
                        to Harry Collett, and made him believe that she cared for another man.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know anything about Miss Leigh’s doings. I remember noticing her
                        talking very assiduously that evening with Thaddy. Perhaps it was all fancy
                        of mine; I have no doubt it was. I just mentioned it to Collett as I might
                        mention anything else. I never dreamed that it would annoy him.”</p>
                    <p>“You thought it would merely annoy her?” asked Anne, reproachfully.</p>
                    <p>“I really know nothing about the matter. I’m not responsible for what I may
                        have thought or written a week ago, much less for all these complications,
                        which I never dreamed of.”</p>
                    <p>“Did you suppose, then, that Harry Collett would be utterly indifferent to
                        being given to understand that Marjory cared for another<pb n="32" xml:id="VAB7109-031"/> man, and was not the fit wife for an East End
                        curate, as you expressed it?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know. I wrote, and thought no more about it. If they have gone and
                        quarrelled about it, I’m very sorry—and that’s all I can say.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s tone was bored and slightly impatient. He had evidently not the
                        smallest shame or regret for what he had done.</p>
                    <p>“Since you are sorry—since you <emph>did</emph> write that to Collett,” said
                        Anne, trying to speak as gently as possible—“you will, I trust, do what you
                        can to repair this mischief. Marjory Leigh is too indignant with Harry to
                        answer him at all. Will you write to him and tell him that it was all a
                        mistake—all owing to your having been annoyed with Marjory on account of
                        that laurel crown business—and that there was no foundation for all you
                        said? You will make amends, won’t you? Do write at once.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had risen from his seat, and his face had taken a curious obstinate
                        look.</p>
                    <pb n="33" xml:id="VAB7109-032"/>
                    <p>“I’m very sorry I can’t obey you, Miss Brown,” he said, “but it appears to me
                        that you wish me to write myself down a liar. If these people choose to fall
                        out because of a word of mine, I see no reason to apologise. It is their
                        concern, not mine.”</p>
                    <p>“Was it your concern to write to Collett, then? Was it your concern to take
                        such a responsibility?”</p>
                    <p>“Every one may write whatever passes through his head. I thought Miss Leigh a
                        flirt last week; I don’t now. As to responsibilities, I repudiate such
                        things.”</p>
                    <p>“No one can repudiate such things,” cried Anne. “You have done mischief, and
                        with a few strokes of the pen you can repair it. Oh, you must write, Mr
                        Hamlin—you must.”</p>
                    <p>“If I write,” answered Hamlin, hotly, “I shall just tell Collett that I
                            <emph>do</emph> think Miss Leigh a flirt. I cannot refuse to write, but
                        I refuse to eat my words. Have you paper and a pen?”</p>
                    <pb n="34" xml:id="VAB7109-033"/>
                    <p>He had gone to Anne’s writing‐table. Anne put her arm over it.</p>
                    <p>“You have told a falsehood once, you shall not tell it twice,” she said.</p>
                    <p>“I said that merely to show you how impossible your request was. After all,
                        my dear Miss Brown, a man does owe something to himself and to his name, and
                        there is such a thing as proper pride.”</p>
                    <p>“Is there?” answered Anne, and the words were like drops of freezing water.
                        “I thought,” she added, the remembrance of what he had answered when she had
                        entreated him not to slander himself in those sonnets “Desire,” “that your
                        school considered it legitimate for a man to say that he had committed no
                        matter what baseness, even those which he had not. But I see,” and Anne’s
                        indignation blazed up, “that you want sometimes to be considered wicked, but
                        that you succeed only in being mean.”</p>
                    <p>“I think that is a little hard upon me,” he answered mournfully and bitterly,
                        and left the<pb n="35" xml:id="VAB7109-034"/> room. He was thinking of all
                        he had done for Anne—all that he had done and left undone.</p>
                    <p>Anne remained seated, looking into the fire, for some moments. Then she went
                        to her desk and took paper and an envelope.</p>
                    <p>“DEAR MR COLLETT,” she wrote slowly, “Mary Leigh has just shown me your
                        letter to Marjory, which has greatly shocked and grieved me. As I know that
                        the person who misled you about Marjory and Mr O’Reilly, between whom there
                        has never been a shadow of a flirtation, is Mr Hamlin, I feel bound to tell
                        you, not only that to my knowledge Marjory has not seen Mr O’Reilly except
                        once since your departure; but also, as having been present on the occasion
                        of the supposed flirtation, that Mr Hamlin imagined the flirtation, and
                        wrote to you about it merely because he was in an ill temper, and because
                        Marjory had annoyed him that evening by detecting a fraud in the
                        spiritualistic <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign> in which we were
                        engaged. Mr Hamlin has himself just told me that he<pb n="36" xml:id="VAB7109-035"/> does not any longer believe in the flirtation,
                        and had no notion of creating any mischief. So, as he is not writing to you
                        himself, I feel bound to tell you the real state of affairs, and I trust you
                        will immediately let Marjory know that your suspicions were groundless, as
                        she is very unhappy, and indignant with your letter.—Believe me, dear Mr
                        Collett, yours sincerely, ANNE BROWN.”</p>
                    <p>Anne stopped several times in course of writing, and read and re‐read her
                        letter. Hamlin had refused to make amends; well, she must make them for him:
                        the matter was simple, and it was Anne’s character, whenever she saw the
                        right course, to take it without hesitation, however painful to her. Like
                        many very honest and firm people, she had something destructive in her
                        temper; she could, as Sacha Elaguine had said, sacrifice herself and others
                        with a sort of sullen savage satisfaction. It was a humiliation for Hamlin,
                        but he had deserved it; it was a bitter humiliation for herself, but her<pb n="37" xml:id="VAB7109-036"/> debt of gratitude towards Hamlin forced
                        her to take the consequences of the bad that was in him as well as the good.
                        To admit that Hamlin had, from mere womanish ill‐temper, calumniated a
                        friend, wantonly and thoughtlessly made two loving natures mistrust each
                        other, and that he had then refused to repair the mischief of his own
                        making,—this was intolerably bitter to Anne; still it had to be done. She
                        put the letter on the hall table, and bade the servant post it without
                        delay. Then she felt the full ignominy of the matter; and her whole nature
                        recoiled from Hamlin’s. Nay, it did not recoil; there was no reality to
                        shrink from. Anne no longer felt horror as she had done when he had given
                        her that poem about Cold Fremley; she rccognised that his fault was
                        negative, that his moral evil was moral nullity—the utter incapacity in this
                        man, who had acted so chivalrously towards her, of perceiving when he was
                        doing a mean thing. And the thought that she would be chained for ever to
                        the side of a man whose whole<pb n="38" xml:id="VAB7109-037"/> nature was
                        merely æsthetic, who was wholly without moral nerves or moral muscles,
                        filled her with despair.</p>
                    <p>The next day, Hamlin sent word that he had to go and see some pictures at
                        Oxford, and would be away for two days. Anne felt a vague hope that he was
                        ashamed of himself. Madame Elaguine called, and with her came Cosmo Chough.
                        The conversation, to Miss Brown’s annoyance, turned upon the spiritualistic
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">séance</foreign> of the previous week.</p>
                    <p>“What a fool Walter is!” exclaimed Sacha. “Fancy his moping in a corner
                        because the spirits crowned him with paper laurels! I can’t understand a man
                        not having more brass, not putting a better face on things. But Walter is a
                        curious creature: in many respects he is not a man but a child. He has seen
                        a great deal of life, and yet in many things he is like a girl of
                        fifteen.”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, evasively, “has an essentially artistic nature; the
                        realities of the world don’t appeal much to him.”</p>
                    <pb n="39" xml:id="VAB7109-038"/>
                    <p>“Unless an artist feel the realities of the world,” said Madame Elaguine,
                        eating some of the petals of the roses that were at her elbow, “his art will
                        be very thin. Life must stain the artist with its colours, or his art will
                        be tintless.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had often said those same words to herself; yet somehow she knew that in
                        Sacha Elaguine’s mouth they had a different meaning; and she felt it, when,
                        with her curious, half‐childlike, and yet infinitely conscious smile, she
                        turned to Chough.</p>
                    <p>“Don’t you think so, Signor Cosmo?”</p>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough pretended that he understood, as he always did, whenever he
                        thought that passion and the Eternal Feminine were in question; he tightened
                        his black moustachioed lips into a long grimace, and bowed in deferential
                        agreement.</p>
                    <p>“Of course,” said the little man, sticking his single eye‐glass in his eye,
                        “we all know that our friend Hamlin will never get out of life all that
                        perfume, that narcotic and bitter‐sweet<pb n="40" xml:id="VAB7109-039"/>
                        fiavour, which some other men taste, to be poisoned for ever, with their
                        first mouthful of honey. Hamlin is, in some respects, a little more and a
                        little less than a man.”</p>
                    <p>“A goose, in short,” laughed Sacha.</p>
                    <p>“He is, purely and simply, an artist. Passions, senses, all the things which
                        belong to other men’s personality, belong to him only as factors of his art.
                        And this is perhaps not to be regretted, but to be rejoiced in. There is
                        terrible danger of the artist being swallowed up by the man. Of the poets
                        whom God sends on earth, two‐thirds are lost to mankind: their passions,
                        which should be merely so many means of communication between their soul and
                        the universe, eat them up; or rather they feed themselves on what should
                        become the world’s honey. And even of those who are not lost entirely, how
                        many are there not whose lives are engulfed by passions; to whom, alas! what
                        they sing is but the wretched shadow of what they feel!” And Chough sighed,
                        and fixed his eyes on his<pb n="41" xml:id="VAB7109-040"/> lacquered
                        boot‐tips, as much as to intimate that he, who lived on mutton‐chops and
                        spent his life nursing an epileptic wife, was of that Caliph Vathek
                        kind.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine laughed; but Chough thought it was at Hamlin, and
                        frowned.</p>
                    <p>“Herein lies Hamlin’s advantage; he is the pure artist. And, mark me,” he
                        said, looking fiercely around him, “he is none the worse for that. No,
                        rather the better. I know no man to compare with Hamlin as a mere person; to
                        compare with him not merely in genius, but in kindliness of temper, in
                        purity of soul, in delicacy of thoughts. He is not merely a great artist,
                        but a work of art; he is like a picture of Sir Galahad vivified, or like a
                        sonnet of Dante turned into flesh—and I think Miss Brown will agree with
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin,” said Anne, slowly, “is a very generous man and a very chivalric
                        man, and,” she added, feeling as if Madame Elaguine were looking into her
                        soul, and as if she must read ingratitude written in it, “I feel that I
                            am<pb n="42" xml:id="VAB7109-041"/> indebted to him not merely for all
                        he has done for me, but for the way in which he has done it—”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, no!” exclaimed the polite little poet, to whom Anne was quite the
                        goddess, “don’t say that, Miss Brown; you can never owe anything to any one.
                        Whatever a man can do, is a tribute which his nature forces him to lay down
                        at your shrine.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes,” mused Madame Elaguine, following out the pattern of the carpet with
                        her parasol “indebted—that is how one must feel towards Walter—indebted for
                        the pleasure, &amp;c., &amp;c., of so charming an acquaintance; but
                        love—one can’t love where there is only artistic instinct to meet one—”</p>
                    <p>“I know nothing about such matters,” said Anne, quietly.</p>
                    <p>“But, perhaps—Hamlin may be a sort of child of genius, and the man, the man
                        who feels may come later,” finished the Russian.</p>
                    <p>“When people don’t feel, they don’t feel,” said Anne, sternly; “I
                        mean—morally.”</p>
                    <pb n="43" xml:id="VAB7109-042"/>
                    <p>“By the way,” exclaimed Chough, “I am reading such a delightful book—have you
                        ever read it, Madame Elaguine?—The Letters of Mademoiselle Aïssé—”</p>
                    <p>“Who was Mademoiselle Aïssé?” asked Anne absently, forgetting that experience
                        had taught her that it was safer not to inquire too curiously into Mr
                        Chough’s heroines.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose she was some improper lady or other—all your poetic ladies were,
                        weren’t they?” asked Madame Elaguine. “Something like your Belle Heaulmière,
                        whom you insisted on talking about at poor Lady Brady’s party, although I
                        kept making signs to you the whole time.”</p>
                    <p>“Improper?” exclaimed Chough. “Mademoiselle Aïssé was the soul of virtue—the
                        purest woman—of the eighteenth century.”</p>
                    <p>“Tell us about this purest woman of—the eighteenth century,” laughed
                        Sacha.</p>
                    <p>“She was the daughter of kings; her name was originally Ayesha, like the wife
                        of the Prophet—but she became a slave, and was sold as<pb n="44" xml:id="VAB7109-043"/> a child to M. de Ferréol—I think that was his
                        name—who was ambassador at Constantinople. M. de Ferréol sent her to his
                        sister‐in‐law in Paris to educate. Aïssé grew up the most refined and
                        accomplished woman,—you should read her letters—perfect gems!—and
                        marvellously beautiful. Life was just opening to her, and love also, when M.
                        de Ferréol returned from Constantinople, and said to this exquisite, proud,
                        and pure‐minded creature: ‘You are my slave; I bought you, I educated you;
                        now love me.’”</p>
                    <p>Chough paused and looked round him to watch the effect of his eloquence. But
                        his eyes fell upon Anne. She was very white.</p>
                    <p>“Well—and what did Aïssé answer?” asked Madame Elaguine.</p>
                    <p>“Aïssé answered—let me see, what did Aïssé answer?—oh, I should spoil your
                        pleasure were I to tell it you. I will bring you the book, dear Madame
                        Elaguine, and you shall tell me what you think of it.”</p>
                    <pb n="45" xml:id="VAB7109-044"/>
                    <p>Anne felt that she had betrayed herself. To Sacha, she hoped, she believed
                        not—but to Chough. The little poet, in his trumpery way, was really attached
                        to Anne, whom he considered as his guardian angel; and perhaps his affection
                        had made him understand.</p>
                    <p>“What became of Mademoiselle Aïssé?” asked Anne, some time later, as she
                        stood by the piano where Chough was playing.</p>
                    <p>Chough looked up. “Oh—why—she—in short—afterwards—she died.”</p>
                    <p>“Would you like to see the book?” asked Madame Elaguine; “I have some others
                        on hand at present. Mr Chough shall send it to you—”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, thank you,” answered Anne, “I have a heap of books to get through;
                        and—I don’t care what happened to Mademoiselle Aïssé.”</p>
                    <p>“You are very hard‐hearted, Anne.”</p>
                    <p>“She would not have objected to M. de Ferréol if she had remained a mere
                        little Turkish slave‐girl; she would have thought<pb n="46" xml:id="VAB7109-045"/> him a sort of God. She had no business to let her
                        education make her squeamish.”</p>
                    <p>“A nasty old ambassador!” said Madame Elaguine. “<emph>I</emph> think it was
                        awfully hard upon her, poor thing! And was she in love with some one else,
                        Mr Chough?”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHEN</hi> Chough first told her the story of Mademoiselle Aïssé, it was
                        as if Anne had been suddenly confronted by her own wraith, surrounded by
                        strange and tragic lights; and the shock was very violent. But Miss Brown
                        was too honest not to see after a minute that between her and Aïssé there
                        was an unfathomable difference. M. de Ferréol was a mere experimentalising
                        old <foreign xml:lang="fre">roué</foreign>, who had had a mistress prepared
                        as he might have had a goose fattened; and what he claimed of Aïssé was her
                        infamy. Anne’s conscience smote her; she was very ungrateful. And she
                        thought over all those scenes at the Villa Arnolfini, at Florence, nay, here
                        in England not so long ago; she thought of Hamlin’s<pb n="48" xml:id="VAB7109-047"/> generosity and delicacy of mind—of the quixotic
                        way in which he had bound himself while leaving her free—of the chivalrous
                        way in which he had dowered her, making her feel almost as if all this
                        money, which placed her on his own level, was her own inheritance, and not
                        his charity. She remembered all the respect, which was more of a brother
                        than of a lover, with which he treated her—the constant manner in which he
                        hid all her obligations to him, never letting any taunt or harsh word of
                        hers get the better of his resolution that Anne should feel that she owed
                        nothing to him, and that he craved for her love as he might have done for
                        that of a queen. And it came home to her how pure, nay, how poetically and
                        romantically noble was the love which he asked for; and she felt almost
                        wicked when she reflected that what he wanted was to make her into the very
                        highest thing which a man can make a woman—a sort of Beatrice, a creature to
                        love whom will be spiritual redemption. All these things did Anne say to
                        herself; but<pb n="49" xml:id="VAB7109-048"/> it cost her an effort, and the
                        strain could not be kept up. The fact was that she had, in her terror of
                        being unjust, refused to listen to her own plea. But it came back to her
                        like an overwhelming flood. She could not love Hamlin; her soul recoiled
                        from contact with his as her body might have recoiled from the forced
                        embrace of a corpse: such a union, it seemed, would mean the death of her
                        own nature. To be Hamlin’s wife, to spend all her life by his side,
                        hopelessly watching his growing callousness to everything for which she felt
                        born,—to feel one generous impulse after another gradually waxing feebler,
                        one energy after another for good becoming paralysed by the deathly moral
                        chill of his utter heartlessness,—was this not much worse than any mere
                        dishonour of the body, this prostitution of the spirit? Aïssé’s soul at
                        least was free; her Ferréol could not deprive her of her moral freedom, her
                        aspirations, her powers of self‐sacrifice; but with her, Anne Brown, it was
                        different. And she repeated to herself with bitterness the<pb n="50" xml:id="VAB7109-049"/> warning words which Richard Brown had spoken in
                        vain so long, long ago: “You will be his to do what he chooses; worse than
                        his slave, his mere chattel and plaything.” How little Dick had guessed the
                        much more terrible meaning which these words would come to have for her!</p>
                    <p>Unconsciously Anne’s mind reverted to the business of Marjory and Harry
                        Collett; and her mind’s eye rested for a moment upon those two lovers, to
                        each of whom, through whatsoever of discrepancy there might be, the other
                        represented his or her highest ideal, that other’s opinion his or her
                        highest conscience; not passionately in love, like Othello and Desdemona, or
                        Romeo and Juliet, but persuaded to their inmost soul that in living by each
                        other’s side, and sympathising with and helping in the other’s work, each
                        would be fulfilling his or her best destiny in the world. Another woman
                        situated like Anne might have let herself be tempted into cynicism by
                        unconscious envy; but this was not<pb n="51" xml:id="VAB7109-050"/> within
                        Miss Brown’s honest, and open‐eyed, and stern nature. She never once said to
                        herself—“Marjory and Harry will awake one day from their dream.” She had
                        dreamed, alas! and had awakened; but she recognised that these two were
                        broad awake, and that their happiness was a reality. Anne looked at these
                        two lovers for a moment, but without any envy or bitterness. It never even
                        entered her mind to covet their happiness, to imagine that she might have a
                        right to anything similar. Anne, though leaning towards socialism in her
                        theories, was not in the least a communistic mind; she did not ask, “Why
                        should I not get the same advantages as my neighbours?” She envied no one
                        the prize in the lottery; she begged only for a chance. To be the wife of a
                        man whom she loved, and who loved her—to be the companion and helpmate of
                        some one who was striving after her own ideals; such hankerings had never
                        passed through her mind—or, if they had, they had long since been banished.
                            What<pb n="52" xml:id="VAB7109-051"/> Anne longed for, what her soul
                        hungered after, was merely negative freedom. Freedom to sympathise and to
                        aspire—to do whatever little she still might to carve herself out a
                        spiritual life of her own, no matter how mean and insignificant; freedom to
                        live in that portion of her which was most worthy of life. To gain her
                        bread, no matter how harshly; to be of some use, to teach at a school or
                        nurse at a hospital; nay, to be able merely to encourage others to do what
                        she might not,—this was all that Anne asked; and this, in her future as the
                        wife of Hamlin, as the queen of this æsthetic world, which seemed to poison
                        and paralyse her soul, was what she knew she could not have, what she knew
                        she must do without.</p>
                    <p>“I am a selfish brute,” she suddenly said to herself, “wasting the time which
                        is still mine,”—and she took down her books of political economy, and tried
                        to fix her attention upon them, and think out a scheme of the lessons and
                        exercises which she would give to the shop‐girls at the Working Women’s
                            Club.<pb n="53" xml:id="VAB7109-052"/> But what was the use of doing
                        this? Hamlin, she knew, loathed the notion of her teaching at the Club; he
                        would never let her teach there; and, once his wife, she understood him
                        sufficiently to be fully aware that he would consider himself completely
                        empowered to make her do or leave alone whatever he chose.</p>
                    <p>Still Anne tried to work on courageously. In the afternoon she went to hear
                        one of Professor Richmond’s lectures. This was the fervent young positivist
                        whom Cousin Dick so much admired, and whose intense moral convictions had
                        done a good deal to keep Anne out of the slough of desponding pessimism
                        round which she had been some time hovering. Andrew Richmond was a man who
                        had many slanderers, many of whom he has now left behind him—their
                        misrepresentations having been more long‐lived than he; for he had passed
                        through many phases of thought, and, being perfectly honest, he had never
                        been able to become unjust to any, and thus had made enemies not merely
                        among the men whose<pb n="54" xml:id="VAB7109-053"/> beliefs he had
                        abandoned, but among those also whose beliefs he had accepted without
                        accepting their follies. He stood very alone; and it was perhaps this
                        isolation—this obvious indifference of the man to all save his own reason
                        and conscience—which added to the solemnity of his convictions; and made him
                        appear, more than any one else, in the light of a priest of morality, of a
                        prophet of the advent of justice. Anne had never spoken to Richmond; but she
                        felt that, of all human souls, this one did the most to keep up the courage
                        of her own. This was one of the last discourses which the poor dying
                        positivist ever delivered; and it was the more earnest for the sense of his
                        approaching end. He spoke this time, or, as his ridiculers called it, he
                        preached upon the relation of duty to progress; upon the value of each good
                        impulse carried out, and each evil one resisted, in making morality more
                        natural and spontaneous in the world; and he insisted especially upon the
                        danger, to people whose ideas of right and wrong rested<pb n="55" xml:id="VAB7109-054"/> no longer upon any priestly authority, of the
                        individual sophisticating himself into the belief that in yielding to the
                        preferences of his own nature he was following the highest law, and that any
                        special usefulness ought legitimately to be bought at the expense of
                        departing from the moral rules of the world.</p>
                    <p>“The danger of our epoch of moral transition,” he said, “lies in the
                        temptation of the individual to say to himself—‘If I am willing to sacrifice
                        myself, have I not a right also to sacrifice the established opinions of
                        others?’”</p>
                    <p>“I detest that man Richmond,” Madame Elaguine had once said; “he puts an end
                        to all self‐sacrifice.”</p>
                    <p>“If you mean the sacrifice of one’s peace of mind and social dignity to the
                        passion of another person and to one’s own, he certainly does,” Richard
                        Brown had answered sternly.</p>
                    <p>At the door of the lecture‐room Anne met her cousin.</p>
                    <p>“Are you driving to Hammersmith?” he asked.</p>
                    <pb n="56" xml:id="VAB7109-055"/>
                    <p>“No; I am going to walk.”</p>
                    <p>Anne had made it a rule for the last two or three months to deprive herself
                        of all luxuries. She did not wish to enjoy everything that she had a right
                        to; she had also a stern pleasure in doing the things most repugnant to her;
                        and a walk through the London streets, in murky spring weather, was to
                        Anne’s Italian temper, nurtured with æsthetic delicacy, one of the most
                        disagreeable of expeditions.</p>
                    <p>“But it is drizzling and horribly muddy,” said Richard Brown, looking at her
                        as he buttoned her ulster over her massive figure. “Surely Hamlin will be
                        very much shocked if you come into the house with mud on your shoes? But if
                        you are really going to walk I will accompany you, if you don’t mind,
                        because I’m going in that direction.”</p>
                    <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
                    <p>“To Hammersmith; I have some business there.” And Brown looked once more at
                        his cousin as he opened his umbrella over her.</p>
                    <p>“Will you take my arm, Anne?” Richard<pb n="57" xml:id="VAB7109-056"/> Brown
                        was not a lady’s man, and there was something awkward and unaccustomed in
                        his request.</p>
                    <p>“I am big enough to take care of myself, I think, Dick. And I know you hate
                        having women to drag along; I have watched you going into dinner‐parties
                        often enough.”</p>
                    <p>“It is out of my line, you’re right.”</p>
                    <p>For some time they walked along in silence through the black oozy streets,
                        crammed with barrows of fruit, round which gathered the draggled dripping
                        women, their babies huddled up in their torn shawls, their hair untidy and
                        dank beneath their once lilac or pale‐pink smut‐engrained bonnets; the cabs,
                        shining blue‐black, ploughed through the mud; the heavy drays splashed from
                        gutter to gutter; the houses were black and oozy; the very raindrops on the
                        railings looked black; the sky was a dirty dull‐grey waste; only the scarlet
                        letter‐boxes stood out coloured in the general smutty, foggy, neutral
                        tint.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remark that public‐houses are the<pb n="58" xml:id="VAB7109-057"/>
                        only places which make an attempt at architecture and ornament?” said Dick
                        grimly, as they passed the ground‐glass windows and colonnade and coloured
                        glass globes of one of these establishments. “Did it not strike you, Italian
                        as you are, that in this country, which has invented high art, the only
                        things called palaces, except those inhabited by royalty, are pot‐houses?
                        Why do your æsthetic friends keep all their æstheticism for indoors? Why
                        don’t they build themselves houses which will be some pleasure to the poor
                        people who pass?”</p>
                    <p>Always that indirect attack upon Hamlin and his friends: it was just and
                        reasonable; yet, coming from Brown, it somehow grated upon Anne.</p>
                    <p>“That will come later,” she said. “The first thing is that the upper classes
                        become accustomed to beautiful things. You can’t expect them to mind hideous
                        outsides to their houses if they are indifferent to hideous insides. I don’t
                        think,” she added boldly, “that<pb n="59" xml:id="VAB7109-058"/> æstheticism
                        has had much generosity of aspiration in it so far, except in isolated men
                        like Ruskin and Morris; but I am sure it will eventually improve some
                        matters even for the lower classes.”</p>
                    <p>“Nero rebuilt Rome, didn’t he,” sneered Brown, “after he had amused himself
                        burning it down?”</p>
                    <p>They fell to talking about the lecture, and then about Richard Brown’s
                        plans.</p>
                    <p>“I hope to get into Parliament next elections,” he said, “and then I shall
                        retire from Mr Gillespie’s firm.”</p>
                    <p>“Why? They say you can make a big fortune if you keep on.”</p>
                    <p>“I have quite money enough; I am a rich man. You wouldn’t have thought that
                        possible, would you, Nan, two or three years ago? Almost as rich as Hamlin,
                        do you know, young woman?” and he turned and looked at her. There was a
                        curious expression, what she could not understand, except that it was
                        defiant, in Dick’s face.</p>
                    <pb n="60" xml:id="VAB7109-059"/>
                    <p>“I am glad to hear it. It is a fine thing to have money; it enables one to do
                        generous things—like what Mr Hamlin did for me, for instance.” Anne could
                        not have explained why she felt bound, at this particular moment, to throw
                        Hamlin’s generosity in her cousin’s face.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, well,” answered Brown, suppressing something he had been about to
                        retort, “of course I could not formerly have done what he did for you; but I
                        would have gladly spent every shilling I had, Anne, to educate you, so that
                        your father might have been proud of you.”</p>
                    <p>“I know you would, Dick—you are very kind.” And yet, thought Anne, until he
                        had been piqued by Hamlin’s offer, he had forgotten all about her. “But why
                        do you intend to leave your business?”</p>
                    <p>“Because I want to give myself up entirely to studying social questions, and
                        my business would suffer if I gave it only partial attention.”</p>
                    <p>And he proceeded to explain the various questions which he intended studying,
                            the<pb n="61" xml:id="VAB7109-060"/> various evils into whose reason he
                        wished to look.</p>
                    <p>“Reform has been too much the leisure‐time amusement of men,” he said.
                        “People have thought that it requires less training to touch, nay, to sound,
                        social wounds, than to set a broken arm or dress a wound. We must find the
                        scientific basis for our art. And it is a very, very long art, and life is
                        very, very short. For my part, I feel that my knowledge is to what it should
                        be what the knowledge you may get out of a school primer of physiology is to
                        the knowledge required by a great surgeon. I don’t suppose I or any of my
                        generation will succeed in doing much practical good; but we shall have made
                        the public ready for certain views on our subjects, and rendered it easier
                        for our practical followers to get their education. There is nothing very
                        glorious to be done at present: no giving out of brilliant new ideas or
                        making of successful revolutions; only patient grubbing at facts and patient
                        working on the public mind.”</p>
                    <pb n="62" xml:id="VAB7109-061"/>
                    <p>“Is that enough for an ambitious man?”</p>
                    <p>“One must pocket one’s ambition. What we want is knowledge, not conspicuous
                        personalities.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was silent. Dick’s words were like military music to her. Oh to be able
                        to join him, to march by his side, to carry his arms!</p>
                    <p>“Go on Dick, please. It does one good to hear of these things.”</p>
                    <p>Dick went on.</p>
                    <p>“You must not overwork yourself,” said Anne, anxiously. “Just think if you
                        were to break down, as so many men have done—as poor Richmond is doing.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, I am strong. The only thing which concerns me is my sight. I find I am
                        already unable to read of an evening. There’s no danger of blindness, but
                        the doctor says I must not work by candle‐light. Oh, there’s no mischief. I
                        shall engage a secretary. I know plenty of young men who would come, even
                        for a small salary. There is the son of one of our head workmen, a very
                            intelligent<pb n="63" xml:id="VAB7109-062"/> lad, of whom I am thinking;
                        but perhaps he is not sufficiently educated yet. I must have some one who
                        knows German and French, and so forth.”</p>
                    <p>Anne felt a lump in her throat. Oh that she had been a man, instead of being
                        this useless, base creature of mere comely looks, a woman, set apart for the
                        contemplation of æsthetes! If she had been a man, and could have helped a
                        man like Richard Brown!</p>
                    <p>“But I am not certain of my plans just yet,” added Brown, and he dropped the
                        subject. They walked on for some moments in silence; then he began
                        questioning her about Lewis, and Chough, and Dennistoun.</p>
                    <p>“Chough is a dear good little man,” said Anne; “he is very absurd and vain,
                        and fond of talking and writing about wicked things, which I am sure he
                        doesn’t understand any more than I. But he is so self‐sacrificing, and
                        warm‐hearted, and true. Dennistoun, poor creature, is very morbid and faddy,
                        and, I think, hates me; but I am very sorry for him.<pb n="64" xml:id="VAB7109-063"/> As to Lewis, he may be a very good man, but I
                        don’t like him—”</p>
                    <p>“I suppose you have heard what people say,—that Mr Lewis had rather a bad
                        influence upon Hamlin some years ago—in short, made him take to eating
                        opium, or haschisch, or something similar?”</p>
                    <p>“No—I had never heard that,” and Anne seemed suddenly to understand her
                        instinctive horror of Lewis.</p>
                    <p>“Does Hamlin see much of him now?”</p>
                    <p>“A great deal—more than I can at all sympathise with. Lewis is rather a sore
                        subject between us; he knows I don’t like him, and yet he is very fond of
                        him.”</p>
                    <p>“I suppose Lewis flatters him very much.”</p>
                    <p>“I suppose so.”</p>
                    <p>Anne resented being thus cross‐questioned about Hamlin, but she was quite
                        unable to prevaricate in her answers—her nature was too frank, and Richard’s
                        questions were too direct.</p>
                    <p>“You are not very happy with Mr Hamlin,” he suddenly asked, or rather
                        affirmed.</p>
                    <pb n="65" xml:id="VAB7109-064"/>
                    <p>Anne flushed, but did not answer at once. “I have an unlucky temper,” she
                        said, after a moment. “I am too exacting with people. I can’t get out of my
                        own individuality sufficiently, I fear.”</p>
                    <p>Richard looked at her with pity, and at the same time with that implacable
                        scrutiny of his.</p>
                    <p>“You feel your nature narrowed by all this æsthetic world around you,” he
                        said. “You find these men selfish, mean, weak, shallow—”</p>
                    <p>“Chough is not selfish. As to Dennistoun and Lewis, I told you I disliked
                        them.”</p>
                    <p>“You are equivocating, Anne. You know I am not speaking of Dennistoun, or
                        Lewis, or Chough. You find that Hamlin drags you down, freezes all your best
                        aspirations.”</p>
                    <p>Anne turned very white and trembled.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin is a poet, an artist; he is not a philanthropist or a thinker. But
                        he has done for me more than I believe any man has ever done for any
                        woman.”</p>
                    <pb n="66" xml:id="VAB7109-065"/>
                    <p>“But—you don’t love him?”</p>
                    <p>Richard had stopped as they walked along the Hammersmith embankment. It was a
                        very quiet spot, and not a soul was out in the thin, grey, drizzly fog.</p>
                    <p>Anne hesitated for a moment.</p>
                    <p>“I feel very much attached to Mr Hamlin on account of his generosity towards
                        me—and I feel I can never repay it.” She did not look in Brown’s face as she
                        answered, but stared vaguely at the river, at the dripping trees, the grey
                        willow branches pulled backwards and forwards by the grey current; at the
                        houses opposite, and the boats dim in the fog.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t love him?” repeated Richard in a whisper. “Anne, answer me.”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t see what right you have to ask me such a question, Richard.”</p>
                    <p>“No? Well, I do—and you shall see why. You are not his wife; why should you
                        try and tell lies? Do you or do you not love Hamlin, Anne?”</p>

                    <p>Anne looked for a moment at the swirling waters, at the willow twigs whirled
                        hither and thither.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose I do not.”</p>
                    <p>There was a pause.</p>
                    <p>“You do not love him, and you still contemplate marrying him?”</p>
                    <p>“I contemplate nothing at all. Mr Hamlin has not yet asked me to marry him,
                        and perhaps he never may.”</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense, Anne. And when he does ask you, what will you answer?”</p>
                    <p>“I shall answer Yes. I am bound to do it. Mr Hamlin has done all, all for me.
                        If he wish to marry me, I cannot refuse him the only thing which I can give
                        in return for his generosity.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown burst into a strange shrill laugh.</p>
                    <p>“The only thing which you can give in return for his generosity!” he
                        exclaimed, but always in the same undertone. “Who first made use of those
                        words, Nan? The only<pb n="68" xml:id="VAB7109-067"/> thing which you can
                        give in return for his generosity! Did not some one use those very words to
                        you, long, long ago in Florence, when Mr Hamlin first proposed to educate
                        you, and your cousin said that you were running the risk of selling
                        yourself? But, by God! you shall not sell yourself, Anne. Do you know what
                        you are giving him in return for what you call his generosity?—that is to
                        say, in return for the whim which made him educate a beautiful woman, that
                        he might show her off and have a beautiful wife, if he chose. Do you know
                        what it is? Your love, eh? You have none to give; you have said so yourself.
                        Your body? your honour? Nay, every prostitute, every kitchen slut can give
                        him that. And I suppose such things do not exist for a delicately nurtured
                        lady, a ward of Mr Walter Hamlin’s. No; you are giving him your soul,
                        selling it to him, prostituting it as any common woman would prostitute her
                        body.”</p>
                    <p>“Richard,” said Anne, hotly, “you are my<pb n="69" xml:id="VAB7109-068"/>
                        cousin, and have been very good to me, but that gives you no right to insult
                        me.”</p>
                    <p>“My words are ugly; and what are the things which you would do? Anne, you
                        shall listen to me,” and he laid his hand heavily on her arm.</p>
                    <p>“You can make me stand here,” she answered icily, “but you cannot make me
                        listen.”</p>
                    <p>“I <emph>can</emph> make you listen. Oh, Anne,” and his voice became suddenly
                        supplicating, “do not be womanish, and refuse to listen because I speak
                        disagreeable things. Answer me, on your honour: have I a right to let you
                        sacrifice your happiness, your honour, your usefulness in the world, to let
                        you defile and ruin all these, by becoming what is equivalent to a mere
                        legalised mistress—the wife of a man whom you despise? You have a debt
                        towards Hamlin: I grant it, though you must be well aware how little real
                        generosity there was in his choice of you; but you have a debt also towards
                        yourself. You have no right to pay for Hamlin’s kindness by the falsehood,
                            the<pb n="70" xml:id="VAB7109-069"/> degradation, of marrying a man whom
                        you do not love, by the sacrifice of all the nobler part of your nature
                        which that man will crush out in you.”</p>
                    <p>“If there is anything noble in me, Dick, no one can ever crush it out; and I
                        do not see what real degradation there will be in honestly carrying out my
                        part of a bargain which has been honestly carried out towards me.”</p>
                    <p>Richard paused for a minute.</p>
                    <p>“But,” he cried, “you mistake, Anne; you forget what that bargain was.”</p>
                    <p>“No, I do not. Mr Hamlin promised to marry me whenever I should ask him to do
                        so, and—”</p>
                    <p>“And he left you free, perfectly free to marry him or not as you
                        pleased!”</p>
                    <p>“<emph>He</emph> left me free; and it is just that generosity of his, in
                        binding himself, and not me, which obliges me, if he wants me, to say
                        Yes.”</p>
                    <p>“That is an absurd quibble, Anne. If Hamlin’s leaving you free bound you all
                        the more, why, then, he did not leave you free, and you<pb n="71" xml:id="VAB7109-070"/> need not be bound by a piece of magnanimity which
                        never existed.”</p>
                    <p>“On the contrary, <emph>you</emph> are quibbling, Dick. You know very well
                        that Mr Hamlin meant to leave me free; and it is for this intention that I
                        am, more than for anything else, grateful.”</p>
                    <p>Richard turned round.</p>
                    <p>“Fool that I am!” he cried, “to believe in you and not see through your
                        woman’s tergiversation! You say you do not love Hamlin, but you do; you may
                        despise him, feel his emptiness—I grant it all—be dissatisfied with him. Oh,
                        I know it! But you love him all the same, and you would not for the world
                        give him up, even if he asked you to.”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed bitterly. “The usual generalisations about women. Because I will
                        not do a dishonourable thing, I must needs be a self‐deluding fool. No; I do
                            <emph>not</emph> love Hamlin. I love him no more than this!” And Anne
                        broke a twig off a bush and threw it into the stream.</p>
                    <pb n="72" xml:id="VAB7109-071"/>
                    <p>“You do not? Then, if Hamlin were to release you,—if he were to say, ‘I want
                        to marry some one else,’—would you—would you not regret him, his poetry, his
                        good looks, his fame, his fortune?”</p>
                    <p>“It would be the happiest day of my life!” cried poor Anne, despairingly.</p>
                    <p>“Then that day must come. Anne, I cannot see you sacrificed. I cannot see you
                        lost to yourself and to the world. You <emph>must</emph> not marry Hamlin. I
                        will provide for you; I will take care of you. You shall help me in my
                        work!”</p>
                    <p>“Poor Dick!” said Anne gently, touched by this enthusiasm, “you are very
                        good; but I fear—I fear I shall never have any need of your help; and I
                        would never burden another man—never have a debt again—if I were remitted
                        this one.”</p>
                    <p>“You would have no debt,” cried Brown. “Anne, I am not a woman’s man. I don’t
                        know how to say such things. But ever since I have got really to know you, I
                        have felt if<pb n="73" xml:id="VAB7109-072"/> only I could have such a woman
                        as that always by my side—to tell her all my plans, and be helped in all my
                        work . . .”</p>
                    <p>Richard looked straight before him: Anne could see his face quiver. A
                        coldness came all over her: a coldness and a heat. She felt as if she must
                        cry out. It was too sudden, too wonderful. The vision of being Richard
                        Brown’s wife overcame her like some celestial vision a fasting saint. But
                        she made an effort over herself. “I am bound, bound,” she said; “but if ever
                        I be released . . . ”</p>
                    <p>She hesitated: the longing for what she knew herself to be renouncing was too
                        great.</p>
                    <p>“Anne,” cried Richard, seizing her hand, “I love you—I love you—I want you—I
                        must have you!”</p>
                    <p>It was like the outburst of another nature, a strange, unsuspected ego,
                        bursting out from beneath the philanthropist’s cool and self‐sacrificing
                        surface.</p>
                    <p>That sudden contact gave Anne a shock which woke her, restored her to
                        herself; it<pb n="74" xml:id="VAB7109-073"/> horrified her almost. She made
                        him let go her hand.</p>
                    <p>“If ever I be released,” she said, “I will remain free. I do not love you,
                        Dick.”</p>
                    <p>She was sorry the moment after she had said it.</p>
                    <p>“I have gone too far,” cried Richard.</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye,” said Anne. “We have been talking too long—and—you won’t resume
                        the subject, will you?”</p>
                    <p>There was a command, a threat implied in her voice. Brown somehow felt
                        ashamed of himself.</p>
                    <p>“Not since you wish it,” he said flatly.</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye,” said Anne. And she walked away and entered the house—Hamlin’s
                        house.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> sudden revelation of her cousin’s feeling was more than a shock,
                        it was a blow to Anne. In her loneliness, in her dreary waiting for the hour
                        of sacrifice, Richard Brown’s friendship had, almost without her knowing it,
                        been her great consolation and support. It had given her a sense of safety
                        and repose to think that, in the midst of all the morbid passion and
                        fantastic vanity which seemed to surround her, there was a possibility of
                        honest companionship, of affection which meant merely reciprocal esteem and
                        sympathy in the objects of life; wholesome prose in the middle of unhealthy
                        poetry. This was now gone: Richard Brown loved her, wanted her; it was the
                        old nauseous story over again; the sympathy, the<pb n="76" xml:id="VAB7109-075"/> comradeship, the quiet brotherly and sisterly
                        affection had all been a sham, a sham for her and for himself. Was Mrs
                        Macgregor right, and was there, of really genuine and vital in the world,
                        only the desire of the man for the woman and of the woman for the man, with
                        all its brood of vanity and baseness, and all its trappings of poetry and
                        sympathy and self‐sacrifice? Anne looked round her, and she saw men like
                        Chough and Dennistoun and Lewis, base or doing their best to become it;
                        Hamlin, her girlish ideal of poetical love, had gone the same way; and now
                        the one man who had remained to her as an object of friendship and respect,
                        her cousin Dick, had preached against selfish æstheticism, had talked her
                        into his positivistic philanthropy—had conjured her to respect her nobler
                        nature, her soul, her generous instincts—had supplicated her not to degrade
                        herself,—nay, had quibbled with right and wrong, had urged her to break her
                        trust,—what for? that he might satisfy his whim of possessing her. The
                        solitude and the<pb n="77" xml:id="VAB7109-076"/> chilliness around Anne had
                        increased; she wished for good, but she disbelieved in its existence. Add to
                        this that she felt she was now no longer at liberty to see so much of Dick
                        as she had formerly done; instead of a consolation and a support, his
                        presence seemed to her now more of a danger and an insult. So she waited,
                        hopeless and solitary, for the hour of the sacrifice to strike; for Hamlin
                        to claim her. To fulfil that debt, to suffer that moral death‐blow, seemed
                        to her now the one certainty, the one aim of her life.</p>
                    <p>Such was the bulk of Miss Brown’s condition; but there were streakings of
                        another colour which made it, on the whole, only more gloomy. The
                        possibility, the vision which had for a moment been projected on to her
                        mind, of becoming Richard Brown’s wife, of sharing in all those thoughts and
                        endeavours which were her highest ideal, would return to her every now and
                        then in strange sudden gleams. And this possibility, or rather this which
                        was an impossibility, made the<pb n="78" xml:id="VAB7109-077"/> real
                        necessity of her life only the gloomier for the contrast. Anne had vaguely
                        aspired after a life of nobler sympathies and stronger aims, but she had
                        never gone so far as to dream of sharing the life of her cousin; and she
                        thought that, had matters been different, had she been free, had Hamlin not
                        claimed her, had Richard not loved her (for his love, his selfish tempting
                        her away from her duty, seemed to her a sort of dishonour to him and her),
                        she would have had the fulfilment of her most far‐fetched desires within her
                        grasp,—merely increased moral numbness, the sullen pain of resignation,
                        towards a fate which was too slow in coming.</p>
                    <p>Anne did not pay much heed to Hamlin and his doings: it seemed to her, whose
                        life in the last months had appeared like years, that it was always the same
                        monotony; Hamlin was waiting for her to fall in love with him, watching
                        whether she was not in love already; offering her, in those vague, Platonic,
                        elegiac speeches of his about the necessity of<pb n="79" xml:id="VAB7109-078"/> a higher life of which he no longer had much
                        hope, of a pure passion which he feared he was unworthy to experience, an
                        opportunity for saying “I will teach you how to love.” Veiled in Dantesque
                        mysticism, muffled in Shakespearian obscurity, such was, to her who
                        understood and was expected to understand, the gist of all the poems which
                        he wrote. The day would come, Anne saw it clearly, when some trifling
                        quarrel, some trifling jealousy, some rebuff to his vanity, or some sense of
                        more than usual vacuity, would get the better of Hamlin’s patience, and when
                        he would say to Anne that he loved her and that her love was his life. She
                        had gone over it all so often in fancy, with the bitter sarcasm of
                        understanding that whole, to her so tragic, little comedy. But had she been
                        a person more observant and penetrating than she was (for her long delusion
                        about her cousin Richard plainly shows that she was neither), or had she
                        been less engrossed in her own conception of events, Miss Brown might have
                            noticed,<pb n="80" xml:id="VAB7109-079"/> as spring turned into summer,
                        that certain slight changes were taking place in Hamlin. He had, without any
                        intentional rupture, taken to seeing much less of Chough and Dennistoun; he
                        scarcely ever visited his old master, Mrs Spencer, or any others of the
                        school; he refused invitations to parties, or if he had accepted, found them
                        too great a bore at the last moment; the only house, except that at
                        Hammersmith, which he frequented, was Madame Elaguine’s. He used to attend
                        all her spiritualistic <foreign xml:lang="fre">séances</foreign>, and
                        alternate between finding spiritualism a vulgar fraud and a mystic
                        possibility; he used to quarrel with Edmund Lewis, and at the same time to
                        seek his company more than any other man’s. He would vacillate also between
                        the most extreme opinions about his cousin Sacha. One day he would entertain
                        Anne by the hour about her virtues, her talents, her persecution; the next
                        he would be captiously fault‐finding, accusing Madame Elaguine of being a
                        brainless little flirt, a mere ordinary Russian, who<pb n="81" xml:id="VAB7109-080"/> cared only for excitement and being perpetually
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">en scène</foreign>.</p>
                    <p>“What is the use of asking people to be intense when it is not their nature?”
                        Anne would ask, not without bitterness in her own heart. “If you find a
                        pleasant friend, be satisfied and thankful for your good luck.”</p>
                    <p>Be it as it may, Hamlin was restless, subject to strange ups and downs of
                        humour, sometimes in a state of vague unaccountable cheerfulness, sometimes
                        horribly depressed. To any one but Anne it would have occurred that there
                        must be some novelty in his life. But Anne did not see; indeed, from a sort
                        of instinct, she observed Hamlin as little as possible: she had loved him
                        when she had not known him; the less she saw, except his gentle, chivalric,
                        poetic, idealising surface, the better.</p>
                    <p>But one day—it might be a fortnight after the memorable walk home from
                        Richmond’s lecture—Anne found among her letters one, evidently delivered by
                        hand or dropped into the letterbox<pb n="82" xml:id="VAB7109-081"/>, the address upon which. puzzled her considerably. It was not
                        merely that the handwriting was unknown to her, but that it was so utterly
                        unlike any human handwriting that could be conceived; it was like a child’s
                        elaborate copy of print, but executed with a precision, and at the same time
                        a certain artistic <foreign xml:lang="fre">chic</foreign>, of which a child
                        is incapable. Had she been in Italy, Anne would have expected to find within
                        that envelope one of those marvellously written out and illuminated sonnets
                        which certain needy individuals, counts and marquises fallen into bad
                        circumstances and anxious to redeem their only bed from the pawnbroker’s,
                        serve up at regular intervals to English and Americans, “the many
                        illustrious qualities of whose mind and heart, as well known as their noble
                        family,” are supposed to include munificence to beggars. To Anne’s
                        astonishment the letter which she found actually was in Italian. But it was
                        Italian of Stratford‐atte‐Bow, and her first impulse was to burst out
                        laughing. But the<pb n="83" xml:id="VAB7109-082"/> next moment she reddened
                        with surprise and indignation.</p>
                    <p>“<emph rend="sc">MADONNA MIA</emph>,” began this epistle, which had evidently
                        been concocted with a ‘Decameron’ and a Baedeker’s travelling phrase‐book,
                        and which sounded like English written by a German waiter who should have
                        taken to Spenser after the first dozen lessons,—“Inasmuch as it always is
                        the duty of the honest to warn the unsuspecting, and the most honourable are
                        always those who suspect least, your true friend and well‐wisher desires you
                        may keep an eye upon the machinations of a base woman; and be on your guard
                        against the friendship [underlined] of cousins.”</p>
                    <p>Anne turned the note round and round, and read and re‐read it, her heart
                        beating as if she had received a slap in the face. “The
                            <emph>friendship</emph> of cousins.” Her first thought was that this was
                        an allusion to herself and Richard Brown; some one had understood what she
                        had not, and was suspecting what was not true. But then her mind picked up
                        that other<pb n="84" xml:id="VAB7109-083"/> mysterious phrase, “the
                        machinations of a base woman.” The cousins were not herself and Dick, but
                        Hamlin and Sacha Elaguine, and that was the base woman alluded to. It was as
                        if a great light had shone in Anne’s face; she was dazzled, dazed. The
                        friendship of two cousins! Was there, then, more than friendship between
                        them? Did Hamlin love Sacha, or Sacha Hamlin? Anne gave a great sigh; but it
                        was a sigh of relief,—the sigh of the drowning wretch who is dragged on
                        shore—the sigh of the hunted fugitive who sees his pursuers turn back. The
                        friendship of cousins? Why, then, she was saved, she was free! But her
                        excitement lasted only a minute. Was she to believe an anonymous letter,
                        evidently malicious, evidently intended to slander an innocent woman, to sow
                        discord or to ruin her own happiness? It was evidently from an enemy of
                        Madame Elaguine’s; it could not be from a friend of her own; for a friend
                        would have spoken to her clearly and openly, or would have spared her what,
                        in the eyes of the world,<pb n="85" xml:id="VAB7109-084"/> which regarded
                        her as Hamlin’s affianced bride, must have been a horrible revelation. It
                        was an infamous or ridiculous calumny. From whom did it come? Anne thought
                        for a long time; she counted up her own enemies and Madame Elaguine’s. At
                        one moment she suspected Edmund Lewis, at another Mrs Spencer; but she was
                        too honest to credit any one of them with such a piece of treachery. Madame
                        Elaguine’s mysterious enemies—yes, it must be they! thought Anne; it must be
                        a new trick of theirs, a device for alienating her from her new friends.
                        Anne’s heart sank. Why must such terrible temptations be put upon her?</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown meditated for some time upon what she ought to do. She felt
                        indignant with the mysterious author of the letter; and she felt that, as it
                        contained a slander, it was her duty to let those whom it accused know the
                        whole matter. Should she show that paper to Hamlin? Once in her life, Anne
                        gave way to a movement of cowardice. That letter,<pb n="86" xml:id="VAB7109-085"/> shown by her to Hamlin, would, she knew, bring
                        the catastrophe. Hamlin would be furious and delighted; he would think she
                        was jealous and unhappy; he would on the spot declare that he loved her, and
                        ask her to be his wife. This consummation of her sacrifice, which, in the
                        dull apathy of the last fortnight, she had almost prayed for, now terrified
                        her. When it came, she was ready; but to hasten it—to bring it down untimely
                        on herself—to do that, Anne had not the heart. After all, it concerned
                        Madame Elaguine most, and she would doubtless have some clue to the writer
                        of the letter, and consequently take the matter less to heart. Anne
                        determined to show the letter to her. She thought she would go to her at
                        once, or write; but a faint, faint, almost unconscious instinct of
                        self‐preservation bade her wait awhile; wait till she should have an
                        opportunity of seeing Madame Elaguine in the natural course of events.</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown had made up her mind that the mysterious letter had no sort of
                        truth in it; yet despite this decision, which lay, cut and<pb n="87" xml:id="VAB7109-086"/> dry, on the surface of her consciousness, a
                        hidden imperceptible movement was going on within her. She seemed suddenly
                        to remember things which she had not at the time noticed, to see things
                        which had not before existed, and must still have been there yesterday as
                        well as to‐day. Things which had been meaningless acquired a meaning; things
                        which had seemed without connection began to group themselves. A change had
                        taken place of late in Hamlin; he had become solitary and morose, and more
                        than usually up and down in spirits—he had seen only Sacha and her. How much
                        had he seen of Sacha? Anne did not know, but she imagined a great deal. Then
                        she remembered how he had taken to finding fault with the little woman, to
                        running her down systematically to himself and to Anne. Could it be that he
                        felt himself tempted to break his engagement? Anne knew Hamlin too well by
                        this time to credit him with that. If such a thing should happen,—if,
                        finding insensibly that<pb n="88" xml:id="VAB7109-087"/> Anne was not what
                        he had imagined, disappointed with her coldness, hurt by her censoriousness,
                        and attracted by a woman who was everything that she was not—Hamlin should
                        ever come to feel for Sacha more than mere friendship, it was not in his
                        nature to perceive his danger and to struggle; he would let himself go to
                        sleep in the pleasantness of a new sensation, he would drift on vaguely, and
                        start up in surprise.</p>
                    <p>A new love was for him the most poignant of temptations,—a new love in its
                        still half‐unconscious, Platonic, vague condition; and he was not a man to
                        resist such a temptation; indeed he had gone through life with the
                        philosophy that a poet may dally with any emotion, however questionable, as
                        long as he does not actually commit a dishonourable action. Oh no, Hamlin’s
                        ups and downs could not be struggles or remorse; so Anne decided that it was
                        all fancy, all calumny. And she determined to give the letter to Sacha on
                        the first opportunity.</p>
                    <pb n="89" xml:id="VAB7109-088"/>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine at last made up her mind that her little Helen ought to learn
                        something; and with the impulsiveness of her nature, she determined that
                        she, whom she had always kept under her own eyes, should go to school. Why
                        there should be such a swing of the pendulum, and why Madame Elaguine should
                        not rather hire a governess to teach the child in her own house, Miss Brown
                        could not explain, except by the capriciousness, the tendency always to be
                        in extremes, of Hamlin’s cousin. Anyhow, Sacha had determined that Helen
                        must soon go to school, and she had written to Anne begging her, before the
                        child went, to permit her to share for a week or two the lessons which Miss
                        Brown was giving the little Choughs. “I know,” she wrote, “that my poor
                        little child is not fit to be turned loose among other children yet; I know
                        she is too ignorant, too sensitive, too much accustomed to life with her
                        elders. To learn with Mr Chough’s children, to play with them, will take the
                        keen edge off; and also, I know, my<pb n="90" xml:id="VAB7109-089"/> dearest
                        Anne, that if anything can make this (I fear, alas! alas! to my shame)
                        over‐sensitive and self‐willed little savage more human, more desirous of
                        being good, and of raising herself, it will be your influence. I have often
                        felt what it would have been for me to have had a friend like you, and I
                        feel what it will be for my child.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was touched by this letter. Poor Madame Elaguine, although she did care
                        too much for Baudelaire and Gautier, and did tell too many anecdotes about
                        married women’s lovers and married men’s <foreign xml:lang="fre">cocottes</foreign> for Anne’s taste, was yet a good and brave little
                        woman; and she must be helped, if one could help her. And Anne was doubly
                        indignant about that anonymous letter she put in her pocket, and went to
                        call on Hamlin’s cousin.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine was in one of her unstrung moments. Anne found her lying on a
                        sofa, a heap of books about her, reading none, fidgety and vacant. She
                        brightened up for a moment on Miss Brown’s entry, and<pb n="91" xml:id="VAB7109-090"/> received her with a kind of rapturous gratitude,
                        quite out of all proportion; but she speedily relapsed into her depressed
                        condition. Anne thought it better not to introduce the business at once.</p>
                    <p>“I want to know,” she said, “why you are suddenly so anxious to send your
                        little Helen to school, when you said, only a few days ago, that you could
                        not bear even that a stranger should have any influence upon her.”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine hesitated. “Oh, dear Anne,” she suddenly exclaimed, “I am a
                        poor, weak, vacillating creature, always in excesses. You <emph>must</emph>
                        have pity on me. I suppose it is just because I was so horribly selfish
                        about my child that I have been crushed suddenly with the necessity of
                        sacrificing my feelings completely. It comes home to me—and oh, you cannot
                        think what it means to me!—that I am ruining my child, that she will turn
                        out merely another myself—another wretched, weak, unhappy creature, with
                        just morality enough to make her utterly<pb n="92" xml:id="VAB7109-091"/>
                        miserable, and just common‐sense enough to make her feel her own silliness.
                        It is a terrible thing for a mother to say; but it is true, and I must say
                        it: I am not fit to bring up my own child—I am not worthy to do it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at the Russian, who had raised herself on her sofa convulsively,
                        and thatched and torn to pieces a flower which was lying on her, with a
                        great look of pity.</p>
                    <p>“I am not bad!” cried Sacha—“I am not bad! I want to be good; but I can’t.
                        Oh, and I can’t teach my child anything, not even the multiplication table,”
                        and she suddenly burst out laughing.</p>
                    <p>Anne did not know whether to cry or to laugh.</p>
                    <p>“I quite understand your wishing that Helen should get the habit of work, and
                        should learn something,” she said, in her business‐like way; “but I cannot
                        see the advantage of sending her to school. She is far too nervous and
                        delicate, and far too much accustomed to indulgence, to get anything but
                        harm from a<pb n="93" xml:id="VAB7109-092"/> school. Were she a mere strong,
                        sturdy, spoilt child, it would do her an immense deal of good; but a child,
                        you admit it yourself, so morbidly and almost physically sensitive, would
                        only be miserable at school, and probably be terrified by unaccustomed
                        discipline and want of sympathy. Don’t you think it would be wiser to get
                        Helen a thoroughly good governess, so that she could learn something, and
                        yet be in your house?”</p>
                    <p>“I won’t have a governess; they are all good‐for‐nothings. I won’t have spies
                        in the house!” exclaimed Madame Elaguine, vehemently.</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense!” said Anne; “how can you talk like that? You know that governesses
                        are just as good as schoolmistresses; and for you and Helen such a plan
                        would be in every way preferable.”</p>
                    <p>“I won’t have any one in the house to pry into my affairs!” repeated Sacha,
                        hotly. “Helen <emph>must</emph> go to school.”</p>
                    <p>Anne felt angry with the little woman.</p>

                    <p>“Of course it is for you to choose,” she said; “but I confess I can’t see why
                        you should not have a governess any more than other people.” She felt as if
                        there were something wrong here.</p>
                    <p>“And do you forget what my life is?” cried Sacha; “do you forget that I am
                        the daily, hourly victim of unseen enemies? Would you have me admit some one
                        to my house, that she might play into their hands, or, at all events, pry
                        into my misfortune?”</p>
                    <p>Anne had forgotten that. How unjust she was!</p>
                    <p>“True,” she said; “I think we might find a governess who, even under your
                        circumstances, might be safely admitted into the house. But I can understand
                        your unconquerable aversion to the idea, so we had better look out for a
                        school, and, till one is found, I shall be delighted if you will send Helen
                        to me. I fear I can’t do much for her, but at all events she will meet the
                        Choughs, who are very good little girls.”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine rose, and, to Anne’s immeasurable<pb n="95" xml:id="VAB7109-094"/> surprise, she flung herself on her neck, and began to sob.</p>
                    <p>“Oh Anne, dearest Anne,” she said, “you are so good to me—so good, so very
                        good—and I don’t deserve it at all—indeed I know I don’t.”</p>
                    <p>“Nonsense; you are unwell and unstrung about Helen, and you are just making
                        yourself miserable. Do try and be quiet, and reflect that there is nothing
                        whatever to be miserable about.”</p>
                    <p>Somehow or other Miss Brown, for all her good‐nature, always had a harsh
                        instinct whenever she saw Sacha in such a condition as this—an instinct that
                        the Russian could prevent it—that such fits of tears and abjectness were
                        mere self‐indulgence, and self‐indulgence which was utterly incompatible
                        with Anne’s idea of self‐respect.</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine could not be reined in. She fell back in an arm‐chair in
                        an agony of hysterical sobbing, mixed with ghastly laughing.</p>
                    <pb n="96" xml:id="VAB7109-095"/>
                    <p>“It is not nonsense; it is true—it is true; I don’t deserve it. I deserve
                        that you should hate me. Oh Anne, you must hate me; but it is not my fault.
                        I hate him! I have always hated him! I have told him so; but he won’t
                        believe. Oh, indeed it is not my fault. But of course you hate me, you . .
                        .” and she suddenly burst out laughing.</p>
                    <p>Anne was very white. She had heard and she had understood; but she had no
                        right to have heard or to have understood.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly Sacha started up and looked strangely about her.</p>
                    <p>“What! you are here?” she asked, with a start as if of terror. “Oh, what have
                        I been talking about? Oh, I am sure I have been talking nonsense!”</p>
                    <p>“Poor little woman!” said Anne; “yes, you <emph>have</emph> been talking
                        nonsense; you are afraid of having a governess for Helen, lest—”</p>
                    <p>“Ah!” cried Madame Elaguine, with a sigh of relief. “Oh, you don’t know what
                        it is to have such a fit. One feels one is talking lies,<pb n="97" xml:id="VAB7109-096"/> and yet that one must go on. I never had any such
                        things before they began to persecute me. It is almost the worst part of my
                        misfortune. Fancy seeing, feeling one’s self becoming day by day more
                        abject, and being unable to stop it. Oh, I still feel so frightened!
                        something dreadful must have happened while I had that fit just now. Do call
                        for some tea, Anne, darling; I feel so shaken, as if something had
                        happened.”</p>
                    <p>“You will feel all right when you have had some tea,” said Anne. “Tell me,
                        have they, have those people been frightening you of late?”</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine nodded. “Only last night; you don’t know what happened. I
                        didn’t intend telling you—look here—but it is that that has put me into such
                        a state,” and opening the door of her bedroom, Sachs pointed to the wall
                        opposite.</p>
                    <p>Over Madame Elaguine’s bed hung a painted portrait of little Helen; but where
                        the face should have been was a dark spot.</p>
                    <pb n="98" xml:id="VAB7109-097"/>
                    <p>“Good heavens! what have they done?” cried Anne.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, they have only cut out Mademoiselle Hélène’s face,” said the Swiss maid,
                        who was sitting in the room, with a shrug. “For my part, I am accustomed to
                        such tricks, and so, I should think, must be Madame also.”</p>
                    <p>Something cynical and insolent in the woman struck Anne very much.</p>
                    <p>“How horrible!” she said, leading Sacha back to the drawing‐room. “I can
                        quite understand your being excited to‐day, and feeling anxious about
                        Helen.”</p>
                    <p>“It is because of that,” said Sacha, with clenched teeth, “that I want to
                        send Helen to school. She will be safer there than here. If things go on as
                        now, I shall have to send Helen to a convent; I am no protection to
                        her.”</p>
                    <p>“You must marry, and have a husband to take care of you,” said Anne,
                        quietly.</p>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine turned scarlet. Was she<pb n="99" xml:id="VAB7109-098"/>
                        afraid of having let out her secret? But to Anne’s surprise, instead of
                        looking anxious, a sudden look of triumphant amusement passed over her face,
                        a strange brazen look, and she burst out laughing—</p>
                    <p>“Ah yes, marry!—that would be a fine idea!—and whom, pray? Perhaps Lewis or
                        Chough. True—I forgot—he has a wife! Ah no, a rolling stone like me must
                        always be solitary.”</p>
                    <p>“You need not always be a rolling stone,” said Anne, gently. “But I must
                        go—good‐bye, dear Madame Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>At the door she met Hamlin. It seemed to her that he looked guilty, and
                        coloured.</p>
                    <p>“I have been to see your cousin; she has had another horrid trick played to
                        her. Go up to her, it will do her good to see you; she is very lonely, poor
                        little woman.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was unnerved by the allusion to the persecution. He stood silent for a
                        moment, with a long lingering look on Anne, like a man making a mental
                        comparison.</p>
                    <pb n="100" xml:id="VAB7109-099"/>
                    <p>“You are very good, Miss Brown,” he said, slowly; “there is no other woman in
                        the world like you.”</p>
                    <p>“Sacha has been more tried than I,” answered Anne. And Hamlin went up and
                        Miss Brown went out.</p>

                    <p><hi>MISS BROWN</hi> did not hand over the anonymous letter either to Madame
                        Elaguine or to Hamlin. She felt that she had now no longer a right to do so.
                        Sacha had, in the vague pouring out of words of that fit which Anne had
                        witnessed, let out her secret; but Anne had no right to use it or to act
                        upon it. She could only watch and wait.</p>
                    <p>Wait!—but in what a different spirit! Wait, not for the hour of death, but
                        for the moment of freedom, of complete freedom.</p>
                    <p>“What has happened to you?” asked Mrs Spencer, meeting her on her way back
                        from Madame Elaguine’s. “Why, you look quite another being, Anne—as if some
                        one had left you a fortune!”</p>
                    <pb n="102" xml:id="VAB7109-101"/>
                    <p>“No one has left me anything,” said Anne. “I feel very happy, that’s
                        all.”</p>
                    <p>“But where in all this wretched London have you been that you should feel
                        happy?”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed.</p>
                    <p>“I have been to see Madame Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Spencer frowned.</p>
                    <p>“Well, that wouldn’t be enough to make <emph>me</emph> feel happy, I confess.
                        Was Walter Hamlin there? I believe it’s his safest address now, isn’t
                        it?”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin was there,” answered Anne, sternly.</p>
                    <p>“Mark my words!” said Mrs Spencer that evening to her father and husband, and
                        to one or two of those well‐thinking æsthetes <foreign xml:lang="fre">de la
                            vieille roche</foreign>, whom Hamlin had basely deserted. “Mark my
                        words! Anne Brown has got impatient with all this philandering of Walter’s
                        about that precious Russian of his. There has been a grand scene, and Hamlin
                        has come round to reason. I met her returning from that Elaguine woman’s
                        to‐day, and<pb n="103" xml:id="VAB7109-102"/> she never looked so happy in
                        her life. She said Hamlin had been there, and I know that she gave them both
                        a bit of her mind. She’s a proud woman, Anne Brown, and could squash that
                        little Russian vixen like that!”</p>
                    <p>“But, my dear Edith,” objected her father, seated among an admiring crowd in
                        his dusty studio at Hampstead, among his ghastly Saviours on gilded grounds,
                        and Nativities, in despite of perspective—“how de ye know that there’s ever
                        been any philandering between ’em?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh papa, really now you are too provoking!”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Mr Saunders, how do we know anything?” chorussed the two or three
                        elderly poetesses and untidy Giottesque painters of the circle.</p>
                    <p>“P’raps ye don’t know anything, any of ye!”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Spencer sighed, as much as to say, “See what it is to be the
                        long‐suffering daughter of the greatest genius in the world, and pity
                        me!”</p>
                    <pb n="104" xml:id="VAB7109-103"/>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough had been reading some of his ‘Triumph of Womanhood,’ lying on
                        the hearth‐rug in the studio.</p>
                    <p>“Do you think he has proposed?” he asked, darting up, with beaming eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Proposed! I should think so, and been told not to play such tricks
                        again.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah!” cried Chough, “thank heaven. I—I—” but he stopped.</p>
                    <p>“You shall send Anne your Ginevra in the Tomb, papa, as a wedding
                        present.”</p>
                    <p>“Don’t be in too great a hurry,” said old Saunders; whereupon he was jeered
                        at with all the respect due to so great an artist.</p>
                    <p>For the first time after so long, Anne felt happy. A load was off her mind.
                        That Hamlin should love Sacha, and Sacha Hamlin, was the miracle which alone
                        could release her, and releasing her, put an end at the same time to the
                        horrible false position into which Hamlin’s self‐engagement to a woman so
                        different from himself created for him also in the future. And now only did
                        it strike Anne that perhaps<pb n="105" xml:id="VAB7109-104"/> she had no
                        right towards Hamlin to pay off her debt of gratitude at the expense of what
                        might be his future misery as well as hers. Had Hamlin been sufficiently
                        infatuated to wish to marry a woman whom he did not really and solidly love,
                        would it have been right on her part to let him have his way? All these
                        doubts, which she had previously put behind her, as mere selfish sophistry
                        to tempt her from her duty, now rushed home to her. But they came no longer
                        to torment, but to add to the relief, the cessation of bondage. Hamlin would
                        never, she said to herself, have been really happy with her as a wife; and
                        now it happened that he had met the woman who, whatever her shortcomings,
                        seemed to suit him. That Sacha Elaguine was an undisciplined, thoughtless,
                        rather sensuous woman, loving excitement and art, and indifferent to
                        abstract good and evil, Anne fully admitted; but were not these the very
                        qualities which would make her appreciate what in Hamlin was original and
                        charming, and blind<pb n="106" xml:id="VAB7109-105"/> her, for her happiness
                        (and added Anne, convinced by sad failure of the futility of trying to
                        change people’s nature) and for his, to his weak sides? And Sacha had just
                        that exuberant passionateness, more of the temperament and the fancy than of
                        the heart, which Hamlin required, and which she, Anne, so lamentably lacked.
                        For Sacha also it would mean a new life: it would mean, for the poor,
                        excitable little woman, always defrauded of affection and of an object of
                        adoration, a reality in her life, something to love, to worship, to pet, to
                        flatter—something to make her forget her miserable bedraggled childhood, her
                        wretched married life, her persecution and her maladies. This it would mean
                        to them; and to Anne it would mean . . . Ah! Anne did not dare to think what
                        it would mean for her; she was not yet sure. She might be mistaken, she was
                        still bound to doubt. And still, that great bliss, at which Anne was afraid
                        to look, meant only what to other women would have been a poor gift:
                            liberty<pb n="107" xml:id="VAB7109-106"/> to gain her bread, to feel and
                        think for herself—a life’s solitude.</p>
                    <p>Days passed on; and Anne, instead of being, as she expected, disappointed,
                        was confirmed by every little thing in her belief. On one pretext or other,
                        Hamlin was perpetually at Madame Elaguine’s. The latest excuse for seeing
                        her was to paint her portrait; so, for a number of days, Sacha came every
                        morning to the house at Hammersmith, and spent a couple of hours at least
                        closeted with Hamlin in the studio. Anne usually received her, and she
                        frequently stayed to lunch; and Miss Brown could not help feeling indignant
                        at the coolness with which Hamlin amused himself playing with two women: he
                        was perpetually trailing after Sacha, he was perpetually, she felt
                        persuaded, talking about life and love and himself in a way which was
                        equivalent to making love to the little woman; and yet, he would still come
                        and sit at Anne’s feet, and represent himself as the dejected and
                        heartbroken creature whom only a strong and pure<pb n="108" xml:id="VAB7109-107"/> woman could help. Once, Miss Brown had
                        considerable difficulty in restraining herself when, after a day spent with
                        his cousin, he came in the evening to her, and began the usual talk about
                        his soul being shrivelled up.</p>
                    <p>“I feel I am not worthy to live!” he exclaimed. “I have become too weak and
                        selfish to enjoy the world; I feel that I am sinking into a bog of meanness
                        and sensuality; and yet I cannot even become the mere beast that I ought—the
                        mere beast that would be satisfied with the mud. I keep looking up, and
                        longing for higher things which I cannot attain.”</p>
                    <p>“How very sad!” said Anne, icily; “what a pity you can’t make up your mind!
                        it would save you much valuable time. But then, I suppose, it always comes
                        in usefully for sonnets. That is the great advantage of being a poet.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was silent. He had—she felt sure, and she was indignant as if at an
                        affront—imagined that he might tempt her into saying—“I will raise you,”
                        while his poor, giddy,<pb n="109" xml:id="VAB7109-108"/> irresponsible
                        cousin was being dragged further and further into a passion which she would
                        never recover from—for she, at least, had a heart and he had none.</p>
                    <p>“You despise me!” cried Hamlin, after a minute.</p>
                    <p>“I thought your indecision between the bog and the stars rather contemptible,
                        certainly, just now. But I now see that such conditions are as necessary to
                        you as a poet as are your lay figures and studio properties to you as a
                        painter. It was my ignorance.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin fixed his eyes on the ground. He looked very weak and miserable, and
                        like a man who feels that he has dishonoured himself in some way. But to
                        Anne it was all merely a piece of acting—the climax of that long and
                        nauseous comedy of self‐reproach and self‐sympathising, of pretending to
                        hanker after evil and good, that was equally indifferent to him,—that comedy
                        which had begun long ago in his letters to her at Coblenz, which she had
                        watched with admiration, and love, and agony<pb n="110" xml:id="VAB7109-109"/> at first, and with contempt and disgust at last. And she was hardened
                        towards him. She could have said to him—“Go and marry Sacha!” only that at
                        this moment such a notion seemed an insult to his cousin, and that a
                        horrible fear possessed her that he would seize upon that, and try and work
                        her and her anger into this very patchwork of artificial and morbid
                        sentiment over which he was for ever gloating. Once or twice, indeed, it did
                        occur to Anne that perhaps this whole flirtation with Madame Elaguine had
                        been got up by Hamlin for her, benefit; that he was playing with the heart
                        of the foolish little woman (who did not realise that he was making her love
                        him) merely to provoke Anne’s jealousy—to move her by this means, since he
                        had failed by every other. But even if it had been thus begun, and Miss
                        Brown shrank from believing that Hamlin would have been so deliberately
                        base, it was clear that the comedy had become reality—that he cared for his
                        cousin and she for him. Perhaps—perhaps—all this remorse was real<pb n="111" xml:id="VAB7109-110"/> after all. But Anne’s heart had got hardened
                        against him: she could no longer, do what he liked, believe that there was
                        anything genuine in him.</p>
                    <p>Meanwhile Hamlin’s perpetual attendance on Madame Elaguine had become
                        apparent to every one; and even Mrs Spencer admitted to her father that
                        Hamlin could not have proposed that day she had met Anne.</p>
                    <p>“That is to say—mind you, I daresay he actually did propose; but that
                        wretched woman somehow contrived to talk him over again. I believe she’s
                        capable of everything!”</p>
                    <p>“Well, my dear,” said her father, “it goes a little against your theory that
                        Miss Brown looks just as happy as possible.”</p>
                    <p>“Because she’s too honourable to believe!” exclaimed Mrs Spencer; and
                        forgetting the many acrimonious remarks in which she had indulged against
                        Miss Brown, and the many times she had sighed at Walter Hamlin taking up
                        with a “mere soulless Italian” instead of with this or the other Sappho or
                        Properzia dei Rossi<pb n="112" xml:id="VAB7109-111"/> of her circle, she
                        added—“I always knew that Anne was one of the noblest women in the world;
                        and the nobler women are, the less will they believe in the baseness of men.
                        For my part, I think love and marriage are the greatest curses of a woman’s
                        life.”</p>
                    <p>In which sentiment poor Mr Spencer modestly acquiesced.</p>
                    <p>“I shall have to warn her some day, if no one else has the courage to do so,”
                        she said. Of course no one else did have the courage. Edmund Lewis became
                        every day more and more offensive in manner to Miss Brown; he hated her, and
                        he enjoyed seeing her what he considered ousted.</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor, although she went on abusing Madame Elaguine for being the
                        Sacha of other days, lived too much in her bedroom, saw too little of what
                        was going on even in the house, to guess at anything. Mary and Marjory Leigh
                        looked on in wonder and indignation; but Anne’s calm and cheerful manner
                        forbade their saying anything. Did<pb n="113" xml:id="VAB7109-112"/> not
                        Anne know better than any one how Hamlin felt towards her? and if Anne was
                        satisfied, must it not all be a delusion?</p>
                    <p>“Besides, Hamlin is too honourable,” said Mary, forgetting about the letter
                        to Harry Collett; “and how could a poet, an artist, prefer an odious, rowdy,
                        hysterical creature like Madame Elaguine to such a being as Anne Brown?” The
                        mere thought seemed a profanation.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think Hamlin is a bit noble,” said Marjory, sternly; “and such a
                        little wretch is just likely to pamper his vanity—and Anne is too honest to
                        do that.”</p>
                    <p>“Every man has a nobler and a baser side,” said Harry Collett, mercifully.
                        “Madame Elaguine (though I think it very uncharitable to hate her because
                        she is a little rowdy, and I’m sure she’s quite innocent) may flatter
                        Hamlin’s worse part. But the nobler will always have its way, and with it
                        Miss Brown. Walter is weak, but he can see the difference between an
                        inferior woman and a superior one. Besides, after all, she is his cousin,
                        and I see<pb n="114" xml:id="VAB7109-113"/> no reason to go tittle‐tattling
                        because two cousins are friends.”</p>
                    <p>“That’s the way Harry pays off Hamlin for writing that beastly letter about
                        me!” said Marjory to her sister, when Mr Collett was gone. “How I do hate
                        evangelical charity! how I do wish Harry had just a little of the bad in
                        him!”</p>
                    <p>Mary laughed, and catching hold of Marjory, kissed her.</p>
                    <p>“What do you mean?” cried Marjory, indignantly breaking loose.</p>
                    <p>“I mean, Marjory dear, that though you imagine the contrary, you are very,
                        very glad that Harry is just what he is.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, perhaps I am. But still, oh, I do hate . . .”</p>
                    <p>And thus the Leighs, being very happy themselves, forgot Anne Brown’s
                        supposed grievances, even as the best of us, being happy, will forget the
                        wrongs of others.</p>
                    <p>But there was one person who could not forget what seemed to him the most frightful<pb n="115" xml:id="VAB7109-114"/> sacrilege in the world; and that person was Mr Cosmo Chough. He
                        considered himself as the assistant high priest of the divinity called Anne
                        Brown, and he believed that it was his duty to bring back the high priest in
                        person, namely Hamlin, to the worship from which the powers of evil had
                        momentarily seduced him. But he thought it more simple to apply to the
                        offended goddess than to her recalcitrant priest, who, to tell the truth,
                        had treated his vague remarks with considerable scorn. Accordingly, one day
                        (June had come round now) Miss Brown was informed that Mr Cosmo Chough
                        desired to see her.</p>
                    <p>“How ao you do, Mr Chough?” said Anne, stretching out her hand to the little
                        man, who came in with even more than usually brushed coat and hat, and more
                        than usually blacked boots, his lips squeezed into a long, cat‐like grimace
                        of solemnity, his brows knit gloomily, and walking on the tips of his toes
                        like an operatic conspirator. Mr Chough sat down and sighed.</p>
                    <pb n="116" xml:id="VAB7109-115"/>
                    <p>“Will you have some tea?” asked Miss Brown, with her hand on the bell.</p>
                    <p>The poet of womanhood darted up, laid one hand lightly on Anne’s arm, and
                        opening and straightening out the other with an eloquent gesture, said—</p>
                    <p>“Excuse me. I would rather have no tea. I want your attention—your
                            <emph>best</emph> attention—seriously and at once.”</p>
                    <p>Anne could not help smiling.</p>
                    <p>“You can have both some tea and my best, my very best attention,” she
                        said.</p>
                    <p>Mr Chough sighed, and waited gloomily until tea had been brought, absolutely
                        refusing to open his lips.</p>
                    <p>“Have you brought something to read to me?” asked Anne, thinking it might be
                        some new bit of the ‘Triumph of Womanhood,’ which Cosmo Chough most
                        innocently read to all the ladies of his acquaintance, only Anne having the
                        courage to say every now and then, “I think that had better be omitted, Mr
                        Chough. I think people will give it<pb n="117" xml:id="VAB7109-116"/> a bad
                        meaning which perhaps you don’t intend.”</p>
                    <p>“I have nothing to read,” answered Chough, solemnly. “I have come to ask your
                        advice about a matter more important than any literary one.”</p>
                    <p>“You shall have it if I can give any. Go on, Mr Chough.”</p>
                    <p>“Well, then,” began Cosmo, stooping forward on his chair and frowning, “let
                        me premise that I have two friends whom I greatly value. I am not at liberty
                        to mention their names; but I will call one the Duke, and the other la
                        Marquise.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh!” cried Anne, laughing, “I fear I can’t give you any advice about such
                        exalted people as that. I am a woman of the people, and have never known a
                        duke in my life.”</p>
                    <p>“One moment’s patience, dear Miss Brown. This Duke—who lives—well, let us say
                        he has a magnificent <foreign xml:lang="fre">hôtel entre cour et
                            jardin</foreign> in Paris, has been affianced ever since his childhood
                        to the Marquise, who is the most beautiful<pb n="118" xml:id="VAB7109-117"/> and divine woman in the world, as he, indeed, is the most
                        accomplished gentleman, besides being my dearest friend; and they have been
                        looking forward to a union which will make their happiness, and that of
                        their friends, perfect. Do you follow that? But now—” and Cosmo Chough,
                        stretching out one long thin leg, so as to display his small foot and the
                        martial wrinkles of his boot, and propping his elbow on his other knee—“now,
                        mark. There comes into our perfect duet a discordant voice. A certain lady,
                        whom I will designate as the Queen of Night”—and he made his cat’s grimace,
                        and pausing, looked mournfully at Miss Brown, who sat quietly by, bending
                        over a piece of embroidery which she was doing from a design by Hamlin.</p>
                    <p>“Well!”</p>
                    <p>“Well, this lady, by some occult power of which I cannot judge, gains
                        possession of the fancy of the Duke—not of his heart,—he still continuing to
                        love the Marquise <foreign xml:lang="fre">coralment</foreign>, as the
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">trouvères</foreign> say,—and in short leads
                            him,<pb n="119" xml:id="VAB7109-118"/> without however, as I said, in
                        the least diminishing his passionate love for the Marquise, into acts, or at
                        least appearances, which, to the mind of the vulgar are incompatible with
                        such love. What do you say to that?”</p>
                    <p>Little by little Miss Brown had guessed what Chough was hiding beneath this
                        grotesque piece of romancing.</p>
                    <p>“I say that the vulgar are probably right; and that the Marquise, for all the
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">coral</foreign> love of the Duke, had better
                        throw him over, if she has a grain of self‐respect. Will you have another
                        cup, Mr Chough?”</p>
                    <p>Anne spoke coldly and indifferently; and Chough, who, despite his vaunted
                        knowledge of the human heart, was the most obtuse of good‐hearted little
                        people, actually prided himself upon having put his case so delicately, that
                        Miss Brown could not even guess as yet that she was alluded to.</p>
                    <p>“But the Duke would die were he to lose her! The Queen of Night, who is a
                        wicked fairy—<foreign xml:lang="fre">une méchante fée</foreign>—<foreign xml:lang="fre">une fernme serpent</foreign><pb n="120" xml:id="VAB7109-119"/> —<foreign xml:lang="fre">une mélusine, enfin tout
                            ce qu’il vous plaira</foreign>” (Chough always liked to show off his
                        French)—“has fascinated only his fancy, not his heart. It would be most
                        unfair if he were to lose the Marquise. Well, to proceed; the remedy would
                        easily be found. La Marquise, like all passionately loving women, is a
                        little cold and proud—<foreign xml:lang="fre">tant soit peu hautaine et
                            glaciale</foreign>—need only thaw towards the Duke. She need only say or
                        make a friend tell him, that she adores him and that he is her sole
                        happiness—and see! the Queen of Night’s spells are forthwith broken by the
                        power of true love—the Eternal Womanhood reasserts its right, and all is
                        happy again. But the mischief is, that there is no means of bringing this
                        home to the lady. Lately, indeed, a trusty and respectful friend, an
                        Italian—a poet of some small distinction, I may add—ventured so far as to
                        acquaint her of the public rumour concerning—I mean concerning the Duke and
                        the Queen of Night—in an anonymous letter . . .”</p>

                    <p>Miss Brown suddenly sat bolt‐upright, and fixing her eyes on Chough,
                        said—</p>
                    <p>“You don’t mean to say that you—you actually concocted that ridiculous
                        missive?”</p>
                    <p>“Ridiculous missive! What ridiculous missive?” asked Cosmo Chough, striking
                        an attitude.</p>
                    <p>“Well, I ought rather to say that most ungentlemanly anonymous letter,
                        written in Italian which would make a cat laugh.”</p>
                    <p>“Ungentlemanly! ungentlemanly!” howled Chough; but in reality what he was
                        thinking of was Miss Brown’s stricture upon the Italian.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Miss Brown!” he cried, after a minute, “and it is possible that you
                        should so far have misunderstood the friend who respects you most in the
                        whole world, as to have supposed that that letter had any evil intention? Is
                        it possible that you, who have of all people in the world been kindest to
                        me, who have been as a mother to my children—that you should have such an
                        opinion of me?”</p>
                    <p>Poor Cosmo had let go all his affectation;<pb n="122" xml:id="VAB7109-121"/>
                        he wrung his hands in real distress, and he actually seemed to be
                        crying.</p>
                    <p>“Oh fool, fool that I was, trying to do good, and merely making myself seem
                        an odious ungrateful wretch!”</p>
                    <p>His sorrow was so genuine that Miss Brown felt quite sorry for him.</p>
                    <p>“Come, come, dear Mr Chough,” she said, “don’t distress yourself. I think you
                        did a rather improper thing, but I am quite persuaded that you merely wished
                        to do good.”</p>
                    <p>And she stretched out her hand.</p>
                    <p>Chough struck his head with his fist.</p>
                    <p>“Ah, you are good—you are <emph>too</emph> good—dear, dear Miss Brown! but I
                        shall never <corr>recover</corr> from it—never. To think I only wished to do good—and you think me
                        a slanderer!”</p>
                    <p>“Oh no,” said Anne, quietly, “I don’t think it for a moment. I know that all
                        that letter contained was true, except that you were unjust to one of the
                        parties; for I am sure Madame Elaguine is not at all base, and has no
                        conception of what she is drifting into.”</p>
                    <pb n="123" xml:id="VAB7109-122"/>
                    <p>Chough gaped in astonishment.</p>
                    <p>“You believe it to be true, and yet . . .”</p>
                    <p>“How can I help believing by this time what every creature can see, and what
                        every creature, except themselves perhaps, must and does see as clear as the
                        sun at noon?”</p>
                    <p>Anne spoke very composedly.</p>
                    <p>“But if that is the case—if you know—why then, how is it that you don’t—well,
                        that you don’t put a stop to it?”</p>
                    <p>“One can’t put a stop to what has already taken place.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, but you can—you can—and it was in hopes of your doing it that I wrote
                        that letter. It is to entreat you to do it that I have come now, dear, dear
                        Miss Brown, to supplicate, to implore you . . .”</p>
                    <p>“To do what?” There was a freezing indifference in her voice.</p>
                    <p>“To do what? Why, to do everything and anything! Dearest Miss Brown, I know,
                        I understand fully, that Hamlin has acted unworthily towards you. I know, I
                        admit, that<pb n="124" xml:id="VAB7109-123"/> to a woman like you—all
                        passion, all nobility—Hamlin’s behaviour must be odious. But would it not be
                        worthy of you to reflect that Hamlin is a poet, and acting merely as a poet
                        must act? A poet is a double‐natured creature, a baser and a nobler nature,
                        and his whole life consists merely in receiving as many and various
                        impressions as both his natures can receive. A poet must know the stars, and
                        know the mud beneath his feet; he must drink the milk and the absinthe of
                        life,—he must love purely and impurely, with his heart, with his fancy, and
                        with his senses—ah, you frown!—well, but such the poet is, such is Hamlin.
                        His soul loves and adores you; what if, at the same time, his baser nature,
                        the satyr in the god, be caught elsewhere? He loves you none the less; yes,
                        he loves you even at the moment . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I think this all rather disgusting, don’t you, Mr Chough?” said Anne,
                        sternly.</p>
                    <p>“Nay, have patience—for the sake of Hamlin, for the sake of your own noble goodness<pb n="125" xml:id="VAB7109-124"/>! He loves you: and it requires but a look, a word, a message, to
                        make him forget that other love, to make it evaporate like opium‐fumes. Oh
                        say this word—say it—and blow that ugly cloud of impure love from off the
                        fair resplendent face of his devotion to you! Write to him—speak to him.
                        Empower me, oh dearest lady, to tell him that you love him, and that this
                        wretched fancy of his is making you miserable!”</p>
                    <p>“It is not,” answered Anne, harshly; “it is not doing anything of the sort,
                        and it is no more a fancy than his love for me. As to Madame Elaguine, she
                        is in every way fit to be his wife.”</p>
                    <p>“His wife!” screamed Chough, and looked as if he would faint; “and you would
                        let your resentment go thus far—you would let the nettles choke the roses,
                        the impure passion choke the pure one, you would sacrifice him and
                        yourself—you would let him . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I would let him marry his cousin. There is no impurity about it, so please
                        don’t revert to that, Mr Chough. She is just the woman<pb n="126" xml:id="VAB7109-125"/> who might make him happy; the inclination is
                        perfectly natural and proper.”</p>
                    <p>Chough started up. “Oh, you saint! you noble heroic woman!” he cried, kissing
                        Anne’s dress enthusiastically.</p>
                    <p>“What are you doing, Mr Chough?” she asked angrily.</p>
                    <p>“I am kissing the holiest thing I shall ever touch,” answered the little man
                        solemnly. “Yes! you are a saint, an Alkertis, an Iphigenia! But we will not
                        let the monstrous self‐sacrifice take place! No, by heaven! never, never!
                        You shall not give up your happiness; I will speak to Hamlin. I will tell
                        him all, all—that you love him . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I do not love Hamlin,” said Anne sternly, pronouncing every word clearly and
                        slowly.</p>
                    <p>“You do not love Hamlin!—you do not want—”</p>
                    <p>Poor little Chough was so utterly dumfounded that he had not the breath to
                        finish his sentence.</p>
                    <p>“You have obliged me to say what I never<pb n="127" xml:id="VAB7109-126"/>
                        intended to say to any one,” said Anne. “No; I do not love Hamlin; and if he
                        marry his cousin, I shall be happier than I thought I ever could be.”</p>
                    <p>“You love another!” whispered Chough, his eyebrows and whiskers standing on
                        end.</p>
                    <p>“Neither him nor any one else.”</p>
                    <p>“Then why—why have you not told him so? Why make the sacrifice of your
                        inclinations—because, marrying him, you would be—why?”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin has done everything for me. I was a penniless, ignorant servant.
                        He had me taught, he gave me his money, he gave me more kindness and
                        trustfulness and generosity than any man ever gave any woman I think, and I
                        must pay my debt. If he wants me, he shall have me. If not, so much the
                        better for me.”</p>
                    <p>There was a silence. Anne took up her piece of work; Chough sat rapping
                        gently on the table with his finger‐tips, looking wonderingly at her.</p>
                    <pb n="128" xml:id="VAB7109-127"/>
                    <p>At last Miss Brown spoke.</p>
                    <p>“You have got my secret out of me, Mr Chough. I don’t believe much in you
                        poets; and I think you are a giddy, often a foolish man. But I think you are
                        a gentleman at heart, and a good man; and as such, I trust you never to let
                        out, either by speech or hint or look, positively or negatively, a word of
                        what I have told you. If Mr Hamlin marry his cousin, so much the better; if
                        he marry me, so much the worse. But what must be, must be. And come what
                        may, I depend upon you, as the only friend upon whom I can rely, to forget
                        all that I have told you to‐day. Will you promise?”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown looked very solemn; and Chough was overcome by an almost religious
                        awe.</p>
                    <p>“I promise never to reveal,” he said quietly, “but you must not ask me to
                        forget; I have neither the power nor the right to forget the best thing I
                        have known in my life. Goodbye, Miss Brown, and God bless you!”</p>
                    <pb n="129" xml:id="VAB7109-128"/>
                    <p>And Anne, who believed only in right and wrong, felt really the better and
                        stronger for the blessing of the preposterous little poet of Messalina and
                        Lucrezia Borgia, who declared himself to be an atheist when he did not
                        declare himself to be a Catholic mystic.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
                    <p><hi>SOME</hi> time after this conversation with Cosmo Chough, a circumstance
                        took place which caused great momentary excitement, and considerably
                        unsettled Miss Brown’s mind. The summer had come with a sudden rush; and
                        Hamlin had had the notion of taking his aunt and Miss Brown, and two or
                        three friends, to spend a week at Wotton. Among these friends was Madame
                        Elaguine. That Hamlin should care to take his cousin to the house where she
                        had played so lamentable a part in her childhood; that Sacha should endure
                        to confront those invisible ghosts of her uncle, her cousins, her own former
                        self, of all the shameful past, which haunted that house, was quite incomprehensible<pb n="131" xml:id="VAB7109-130"/> to Anne. But day by day she was forced to recognise that she was
                        surrounded by incomprehensible ways of feeling and thinking, that she was,
                        in a way, like a person solitary among mankind from deafness or blindness,
                        from incapacity to put herself in their place; and recognising this, she
                        recognised also, with her unflinching justice, that she had no right to
                        hastily condemn the things which she could not understand. So when Madame
                        Elaguine, on the evening of her arrival at Wotton, insisted on wandering all
                        over the once familiar house, and openly said that she felt a pleasure, the
                        bitter pleasure of self‐inflicted penance, in confronting the past, in
                        humiliating her present self by the company of her former self, Anne merely
                        said to herself that she could not conceive a woman feeling like that—but
                        that, nevertheless, this theatrical and hysterical excitement might, after
                        all, lead to as good a result as her own silent and painful solitary
                        self‐absorption.</p>
                    <pb n="132" xml:id="VAB7109-131"/>
                    <p>“She is a brazen creature!” Aunt Claudia had cried, when she heard that Sacha
                        was going to Wotton; “corrupt like her father, and fantastic like her
                        mother. She must get Mrs Spencer or some one else to chaperon her in that
                        house, if indeed she wants any one. I shall stay behind. As to you, Annie,
                        you are at liberty to go or not go, of course.”</p>
                    <p>“I shall go, Aunt Claudia,” Anne had answered resolutely, “because I don’t
                        see that I have a right to imply by my absence that I disapprove of Madame
                        Elaguine’s going to Wotton. I neither approve nor disapprove; and I think
                        that, however little we may sympathise with her notions of self‐humiliation,
                        we must give her the benefit of supposing that she is honest in them.”</p>
                    <p>So Anne had gone.</p>
                    <p>The self‐humiliation of Madame Elaguine, and the hours she had spent in her
                        room—she had asked for the room which had been hers as a child—crying over
                        the past, did not prevent her being in excessively high spirits the<pb n="133" xml:id="VAB7109-132"/> evening following their arrival and the
                        successive one. It would seem as if the painful associations in which she
                        had steeped herself had produced a reaction in her whole nature. She was
                        childishly, almost uproariously gay, played with little Helen the greater
                        part of the afternoon, and after dinner treated the company—that is to say,
                        Anne, Mrs Spencer, Lewis, and Hamlin—to a perfect concert of all manner of
                        wild gipsy songs, Spanish and Russian, sung with a fury which amounted
                        almost to genius; and followed these up with little French songs, old and
                        new, picked up heaven knows where—from operettes, from peasants, from
                        books—the words of which and the astonishing <foreign xml:lang="fre">gaminerie</foreign> with which they were delivered, amused Lewis to
                        fits of laughing, threw Chough into enthusiasm, annoyed Hamlin a little,
                        puzzled poor Mrs Spencer, and made Anne reflect, as charitably as she could,
                        upon the different standards of propriety which seemed to exist for
                        Englishwomen and for Russians.</p>
                    <pb n="134" xml:id="VAB7109-133"/>
                    <p>Madame Elaguine’s songs made Anne feel quite uncomfortable and angry; but she
                        said nothing, seeing Mrs Spencer, who could tolerate any amount of
                        impropriety as long as it was medieval and poetic, was evidently putting
                        down this French levity as a mark of the Russian woman’s depravity; and she
                        felt somehow, that though she was annoyed herself, and annoyed with good
                        cause, she must not back up Mrs Spencer’s prejudiced indignation.</p>
                    <p>Cousin Sacha seemed to take a pleasure in vexing Hamlin, in shocking Anne, in
                        making Mrs Spencer think her a wicked creature; she sang on, in her
                        devil‐may‐care, street‐boy way, with a malicious, childish impudence in her
                        face; then suddenly, when she saw Hamlin get positively black at what he
                        considered her bad taste—suddenly dropped from her <foreign xml:lang="fre">leste</foreign> French couplets into a strange, wild, Spanish gipsy
                        song, sad and despairing beyond saying.</p>
                    <p>She looked very fascinating, as she sat near the window, resting her guitar
                        on her knee,<pb n="135" xml:id="VAB7109-134"/> her tiny feet and embroidered
                        stockings very visible beneath the lace flounces and frills of her
                        thistle‐down dress; her deep, Russian blue eyes looking, as it seemed,
                        rather into the past than the present, her whole slight, even emaciated,
                        body and face tense with a sort of hysterical emotion.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly she threw the guitar on the sofa.</p>
                    <p>“Bah!” she cried, “what is the use of singing sad things when one is sad? and
                        what is the use of pretending to be merry, and shocking people with <foreign xml:lang="fre">polissoneries</foreign> when one feels as old and dismal
                        as at ninety? I hate music.”</p>
                    <p>And she walked through the French window on to the wide terrace which
                        surrounded one side of the house and overlooked the lawn.</p>
                    <p>“The only good thing,” she said, “in this world is tobacco‐smoke. If,”
                        turning with affected deference and timidity to Mrs Spencer, who considered
                        a woman who smoked as little short of an adventuress, “you have no
                        objection, these gentlemen and I will have a smoke.”</p>
                    <pb n="136" xml:id="VAB7109-135"/>
                    <p>“Oh, pray don’t mind me,” snorted Mrs Spencer, stalking back into the
                        drawing‐room, and sitting down near the window.</p>
                    <p>The three men immediately produced cigars and cigarettes and matches.</p>
                    <p>“No, thank you, Walter,” said Madame Elaguine; “your cigarettes are too weak
                        for me—too ladylike, like their owner, for a badly brought up woman. I must
                        make mine myself.” And she went into her bedroom, the last room opening out
                        to the terrace, to fetch her box of tobacco and her cigarette‐papers.</p>
                    <p>In a minute she returned, whistling, in a curious bird‐like whistle, below
                        her breath, and rolling a cigarette in her fingers. Some of the party were
                        seated, some standing. Madame Elaguine came to where Miss Brown was seated,
                        looking into the twilight park.</p>
                    <p>“Dear Annie,” she murmured, putting her arm round Miss Brown’s neck, in her
                        childish way, and which yet always affected Anne as might the caress of a
                        lamia’s clammy scales.</p>
                    <pb n="137" xml:id="VAB7109-136"/>
                    <p>“I fear,” she said, putting her face close to Anne, and lowering her voice to
                        a whisper, “that you must have thought me horribly vulgar and undignified
                        and indecent just now. I don’t know why I sang all those nasty songs; I
                        suppose it was to vex Walter. I don’t like them myself. But sometimes a sort
                        of horrible desire, a kind of demon inside me, makes me wish to do something
                        which I know is disgusting; I feel as if I could be the lowest of women,
                        just from perversity. Ah, it is sickening.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“Where did you learn those wonderful little Burgundian couplets, Sacha?”
                        asked Lewis, in his sultan‐like familiar way. He had a trick of calling her
                        Sacha every now and then, as he had tried, but failed, to call Miss Brown
                        Annie.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know. I ought not to have learned them at all; and I ought not to
                        have sung them before a man like you, who notices all the nastiness there is
                        in anything, and a great<pb n="138" xml:id="VAB7109-137"/> deal more
                        besides,” answered Madame Elaguine, coldly.</p>
                    <p>“What a Southern evening!” exclaimed Cosmo Chough, looking up at the blue
                        evening sky, singularly pure and blue and high, twinkling with stars, and
                        against which the distant trees stood out clear like the sidescenes of a
                        theatre. “It is sad that our cigars should have to do for fireflies,—to be
                        the only thing imitating that,” and he pointed at the sky.</p>
                    <p>“A lit cigar is the only imitation of the stars which people like ourselves
                        can attempt,” said the Russian. “It’s so in everything—our poetry, our
                        passions—nothing but cigar‐lights for stars; don’t you think so, Annie?”</p>
                    <p>“What’s that?” asked Chough, suddenly.</p>
                    <p>They looked up at his startled voice.</p>
                    <p>“What’s what?” asked Madame Elaguine, quietly. “Have you seen the ghost of
                        Imperia of Rome, Mr Chough?”</p>
                    <p>“What the deuce is that?” exclaimed Lewis. In the midst of the general
                            blue<pb n="139" xml:id="VAB7109-138"/> dusk, one of the cedars on the
                        lawn, and a screen of trees beyond, had suddenly burst into sight, enveloped
                        in a bright light, which made the grass all round burn out a vivid
                        yellowish‐green against the darkness.</p>
                    <p>Anne turned round quickly and looked behind her.</p>
                    <p>“The house is on fire!” she cried. “Madame Elaguine’s room!” And before the
                        others could understand, she had rushed towards the other end of the
                        terrace.</p>
                    <p>The light, which had suddenly illumined the piece of lawn, the trees
                        opposite, did issue, a brilliant broad sheet like that of large chandelier,
                        from out of the open window of Sacha’s room.</p>
                    <p>“Good heavens!” cried Hamlin, “you must have set the curtains on fire with
                        the match of your cigarette!”</p>
                    <p>“No, no,” cried Madame Elaguine, “I lit my cigarette here outside; it must be
                        . . .” and she rushed wildly after Anne into her bedroom.</p>
                    <pb n="140" xml:id="VAB7109-139"/>
                    <p>An extraordinary spectacle met Miss Brown first, and the rest of the party an
                        instant or two later.</p>
                    <p>The large old‐fashioned bed of Cousin Sacha, which stood in the centre of the
                        room, was burning, blazing like a Christmas pudding, its whole top, coverlet
                        and pillows, turned into a roaring mass of bluish flame, whence arose an
                        acrid stifling smell.</p>
                    <p>“They have done it! they have done it!” shrieked Madame Elaguine, throwing
                        herself into Hamlin’s arms. “They want to kill me! they have always said
                        so!”</p>
                    <p>But before he had had time to answer, she had rushed off into a neighbouring
                        room, and, with a presence of mind most unexpected in her, returned with a
                        heap of woollen blankets which she had dragged off a bed.</p>
                    <p>“Pour the water on this!” she cried to Anne, who, with her strong arms, had
                        immediately dashed the contents of a bath on to the flames. “Soak this! it
                        is useless throwing water on the flames;” and taking the soaking<pb n="141" xml:id="VAB7109-140"/> blankets, the little woman threw them dexterously
                        on to the blazing bed, among the hissing of the smoke and fire.</p>
                    <p>In a minute every one had brought blankets, cushions, water; the servants had
                        run up; and in about five minutes the flames were extinguished.</p>
                    <p>The damages were very trifling compared with the appearance of danger. The
                        fire had not spread beyond the surface of the bed, and consumed only the
                        upper layer of bedding. But the sight of that expanse of waving blue flame
                        had been frightful, and it seemed impossible to realise that no harm had
                        been done.</p>
                    <p>“How has it happened?”—“How have they done it?”—“Send to the police
                        station.”—“Scour the park!”—every one was talking at the same time.</p>
                    <p>“I’ll go down into the park and have a good hunt,” said Hamlin, taking down
                        one of the guns which hung in the hall; “they can’t have got far yet.”</p>
                    <pb n="142" xml:id="VAB7109-141"/>
                    <p>“I don’t think you’ll catch them,” answered Lewis, in his drawling ironical
                        way.</p>
                    <p>“We’re not in Russia, Mr Lewis,” rejoined Mrs Spencer, bridling up;
                            “<emph>here</emph> any one can be caught; it’s not an incompetent police
                        as abroad.”</p>
                    <p>“Some things can’t be caught,” said Lewis, with an odd wise smile.</p>
                    <p>While they were standing discussing in the hall, they were startled by a
                        sudden thump on the floor. Madame Elaguine, who had hitherto been singularly
                        calm and energetic, had fallen in a half‐fainting condition, like a column
                        on to the ground. She was carried in to a couch in the drawing‐room, and
                        Anne called the Swiss maid, who came, with that sort of insolent
                        indifference to the condition of her mistress, which had struck Miss Brown
                        on more than one similar occasion. Madame Elaguine was in a state of
                        hysterical panic—she wept, and laughed, and talked, and moaned; but she
                        absolutely refused to be put to bed, and insisted with great violence
                            that<pb n="143" xml:id="VAB7109-142"/> some of the company should remain
                        about her. She kept Hamlin seated by the side of the sofa, his hand in hers,
                        until the arrival of the police, and of neighbours who had heard of the
                        burning bed, obliged him and the men to leave her. As soon as only Mrs
                        Spencer and Anne Brown remained, she became more calm, and merely lamented
                        over her fate, and over the probability that some day her enemies would
                        really succeed in killing either her or her child.</p>
                    <p>A curious coincidence occurred, which remained impressed in Anne’s mind.
                        While the rest of the party, including Mrs Spencer, were examining the house
                        in company with the policemen, Miss Brown, who was seated near Madame
                        Elaguine’s sofa—a sense of unreality, as of being at the play, filling her
                        whole nature after that terrible sight of the blazing bed—mechanically
                        opened a book which was lying on the table at her elbow. It was a child’s
                        story which she had bought on a railway bookstall and given to little Helen Elaguine<pb n="144" xml:id="VAB7109-143"/> to keep her quiet during the journey to Wotton. Mechanically her
                        eye ran along the page; but suddenly it stopped, as she read the following
                        sentence, printed in rather larger type than the rest—</p>
                    <p>“And they never forgot, as long as they lived, that terrible burning
                        bed.”</p>
                    <p>For a moment the words echoed through Anne’s mind as merely so much sound;
                        but, as is the case when we hear a name which awakens associations which we
                        cannot at first define to ourselves, she was conscious at the same time of
                        an effort to adjust her faculties, to seize a meaning which was there, but
                        which she could not at once grasp.</p>
                    <p>“And they never forgot, as long as they lived, that terrible burning
                        bed.”</p>
                    <p>Anne kept on repeating those words to herself. They made her restless. She
                        went to the window, and looked out into the night. The vision of that broad
                        sheet of white light on the terrace and bushes, of that expanse of waving
                        blue flamelets, rose up in her mind.</p>
                    <pb n="145" xml:id="VAB7109-144"/>
                    <p>“That terrible burning bed.” She saw the printed page again. Then, as to a
                        central bubble, other ideas which bubbled up slowly began to gravitate.
                        Madame Elaguine’s perfect, and, in a woman so excitable, unaccountable
                        presence of mind until all chance of further mischief had been over; the
                        blankets which she had immediately dragged out of the next room, as a
                        fireman might have dragged them; the rapid instruction, as of a person
                        accustomed to such things, to wet the blankets instead of pouring water on
                        the flames, as all the others had done; the insolent, indifferent look of
                        the maid; the going into her room to fetch the cigarette‐papers only a
                        minute or two before the conflagration, and when it would seem that whoever
                        had set the bed aflame must have been making the necessary preparations.
                        Then also, the fire had been so carefully limited to the bed, as if no real
                        damage had been meant. No; that was merely consistent with the usual policy
                        of Madame Elaguine’s mysterious enemies, who wished to<pb n="146" xml:id="VAB7109-145"/> frighten, but not to kill her. But another
                        thought arose. Madame Elaguine possessed a good deal of valuable old lace,
                        indeed more than her fortune at all warranted. Old lace was her hobby and
                        her pride; she had always a lot on her dress, on her night‐gown, on
                        everything. Some of the very finest that she possessed existed in large
                        quantity as the trimming of a white satin dressing‐gown, which, towards the
                        evening, was always put on her bed. Anne had noticed it this very evening,
                        when Madame Elaguine had called her into her bedroom to ask her advice, as,
                        with a spoilt child’s coquetry, she often did, about some flowers which she
                        was putting in her hair for dinner. For some reason the maid had already
                        arranged the room for the night, and, as usual, the white satin
                        dressing‐gown trimmed with lace had been lying on the bed. Anne had made a
                        note of the fact, because she had thought at the moment how absurd it was of
                        the Russian to put such valuable lace upon a garment which was perpetually
                            knocking<pb n="147" xml:id="VAB7109-146"/> about, and in which, as it
                        seemed to Miss Brown, she would scarcely be seen except by her own servant.
                        Now, while extinguishing the flames, one of Anne’s first thoughts had
                        somehow been the white satin dressing‐gown. What a pity that all that lace
                        should have been consumed! What an annoyance to Cousin Sacha! But, to her
                        surprise and relief, she had seen the dressing‐gown, a mass of satin and
                        lace, hanging in perfect safety on a peg at the furthest end of the room—the
                        dressing‐gown which, an hour before, had already lain in readiness on the
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>All these ideas moved confusedly through Miss Brown’s brain. Was it a mere
                        ordinary mental delusion, one of those impressions which physiologists
                        explain by the imperfect momentary double action of the two brain‐lobes; or
                        was it a recollection of a suspicion which had long existed in her mind, but
                        unconsciously, not daring to come to the surface? Anyhow, it seemed to Anne,
                        as she stood by the open window looking into the night, and listening<pb n="148" xml:id="VAB7109-147"/> to Sacha’s faint moanings, as if she had
                        gone through that or something similar before—as if it were not the first
                        time that she was invaded by the thought that all this persecution by
                        invisible and uncatchable enemies was a deception practised by Madame
                        Elaguine herself, a kind of artificial excitement and interest got up for
                        the benefit of her friends, for the benefit of her own morbid and theatrical
                        temper? It was difficult for a woman, simple, sincere, completely all of a
                        piece, like Anne Brown, to conceive such a possibility, and still more
                        difficult for her not to revolt from its contemplation as from an act of
                        disloyalty. But, on the other hand, Anne, just in proportion to her slowness
                        of mental perception, had not the power, which so many of us possess, of
                        denying the evidence of her reason for the sake of her feelings. So the
                        words in the book, which seemed as if they contained the suggestion of the
                        whole performance (if performance it was); the fact of the dressing‐gown
                        having been out of reach of all danger; the manner of Madame<pb n="149" xml:id="VAB7109-148"/> Elaguine and of her maid on this and previous
                        occasions,—haunted Anne, and united with the sudden recollection of what she
                        had read in one of Marjory Leigh’s scientific books about the connection
                        between hysteria and monomania, about the strange passion for deceit, for
                        hoax, for theatricality, sometimes observable in hysterical women. And then
                        she remembered the face and voice of Edmund Lewis, his ironical remark about
                        the impossibility of finding the culprits, his indifference and amused
                        superiority. Could he too have guessed?—and, it suddenly struck her, could
                        Hamlin have had the same thought? No, she felt sure Hamlin had not.</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> incident of the burning bed left the inmates of Wotton Hall in a
                        state of excitement which outlasted their stay in the country. All attempts
                        to find the culprits had been useless; and Madame Elaguine had begged Hamlin
                        not to permit any regular judicial inquiry, lest the story of her
                        persecution, about which she affected to be excessively jealous, should
                        become public property. Hamlin, who hated vulgar publicity, easily
                        consented. But the mysterious story was now known to all the guests at
                        Wotton, and soon became known to the whole pre‐Raphaelite set which centred
                        round the house at Hammersmith, with the result of turning Madame Elaguine,
                        in the eyes of Mrs Spencer and her friends, from<pb n="154" xml:id="VAB7109-151"/> something not much better than an adventuress,
                        into something uncommonly like a heroine and a martyr; for it seemed as if
                        these good folk, whose life was the most humdrum prose and whose ideal was
                        the most far‐fetched poetry, felt absolute gratitude towards the remarkable
                        individual who supplied them with a real mystery, a real persecution by
                        unknown enemies, a real romance. So when Sacha, on her return to town, began
                        to suffer or to think that she suffered from nervous prostration due to this
                        terrible shock, and to lie even more than usual on sofas in even more than
                        usually picturesque dressing‐gowns, she found herself surrounded by a crowd
                        of sympathising and admiring artists, writers, and critics, to whom she
                        confided, one by one, and in slightly different versions, the details of her
                        strange history.</p>
                    <p>The only person who seemed displeased was Hamlin; and the only person who
                        seemed cold was Miss Brown. Hamlin always required to absorb the whole
                        attention of any person to whom he took a liking; to see his cousin
                            fenced<pb n="155" xml:id="VAB7109-152"/> round with idiots, as he
                        described it, was almost a physical annoyance to him; he was cross,
                        captious, bitter, and gruff; and the more he showed his temper the more
                        pleasure Madame Elaguine took in provoking him. As usual, when out of sorts
                        with the world, and especially when he felt himself neglected, Hamlin began
                        once more to pay attentions to Miss Brown, to bemoan his own baseness and
                        weakness, to throw himself on her compassion, to insinuate that in her lay
                        his only hope.</p>
                    <p>This sort of talk, with his beautiful dreamy eyes fixed adoringly upon her,
                        his slow quiet voice sounding like that of a votary before an altar, had
                        long become for Anne a mere additional bitterness; a bitterness of
                        comprehension proportionate to the long delusion which had made her see in
                        this sort of behaviour the dissatisfaction of a noble nature, the yearnings
                        of real love. She was accustomed to it; and would have merely smiled the
                        bitter smile which had become part of her nature. But now, every lover‐like
                        look or word from Hamlin<pb n="156" xml:id="VAB7109-153"/> inspired Anne with positive terror; it seemed as if he had let her
                        fancy that he loved his cousin—that he had let her dream of release, of
                        freedom from the life captivity which threatened her soul, only to creep
                        back, as a cat creeps back to the mouse with which it is playing, and slowly
                        stretch forth his hand to seize her. This feeling became so strong in Anne
                        that little by little there developed in her a nervous dread of Hamlin:
                        every time that he approached her alone, that he fixed his eyes on her face
                        or addressed her by her name, she was aware of a chill throughout her body,
                        of a sudden pallor in her face; a chill, a pallor which, if noticed, must
                        mean to Hamlin that she loved him.</p>
                    <p>Into this vague and painful suspense were vaguely mingled the suspicions
                        which she had formed regarding Madame Elaguine. Confusedly Anne was
                        conscious that the worthiness or unworthiness of Sacha was not a matter of
                        indifference to her; if Sacha was a mere hysterical liar, she could not
                        sincerely love<pb n="157" xml:id="VAB7109-154"/> Hamlin, Hamlin could not
                        love her; and if this man and this woman did not love one another, Anne
                        Brown was once more, what she had for a brief time imagined that she was no
                        longer, the slave of her protector, as Mademoiselle Aïssé had been the slave
                        of M. de Ferréol.</p>
                    <p>Suddenly, one day, there came a change, and with it the end of the terrible
                        doubt and fear which were corroding Miss Brown’s soul. What had happened
                        Anne never clearly understood; she only perceived a change, and guessed that
                        it was connected in some manner with the sudden disappearance of Edmund
                        Lewis, and with some tremendous quarrel between him and Hamlin which seemed
                        to have preceded it. Mr Lewis, who had spent all his mornings in Hamlin’s
                        studio, and all his evenings in Madame Elaguine’s boudoir, appeared to have
                        sunk into the ground; his very name was scarcely mentioned; and Anne Brown,
                        who hated the very sight of the little man with the sealing‐wax lips and
                        green cat‐like eyes, who instinctively felt that he personified<pb n="158" xml:id="VAB7109-155"/> all the peculiarities which degraded Hamlin in
                        her eyes, had a vague superstitious notion that now that he was gone
                        everything would settle happily.</p>
                    <p>What had Lewis done? Had he insulted Madame Elaguine; and had this insulting,
                        by a man who was his friend, of a woman whom he loved, made Hamlin suddenly
                        conscious of his love for Sacha, and of his duty to protect an irresponsible
                        little woman whom his indecision was putting into a false position? The more
                        Miss Brown pored over the subject, the more did it seem as if there could be
                        no other explanation.</p>
                    <p>But whatever the explanation, the result was unmistakable. On the score of
                        ill‐health, Madame Elaguine had more or less dismissed all those admiring
                        and sympathising friends who had given Hamlin so much umbrage, and Hamlin
                        had become almost her sole and constant visitor. He appeared to have almost
                        taken up his abode at the Russian’s. He came to Hammersmith for lunch as
                        usual, but always<pb n="159" xml:id="VAB7109-156"/> found some excuse or
                        other for leaving immediately after: he was painting a portrait of his
                        cousin, and his cousin was too delicate to give him sittings except in her
                        drawing‐room. He not merely neglected Anne, but obviously avoided her. He
                        seemed to dread being left alone with her, as much as she, for such very
                        different reasons, had dreaded to be left alone with him: when he did not
                        succeed in getting away, he was moody and depressed; yet he seemed moody and
                        depressed also whenever, as was frequently the case, he was sent for by his
                        cousin, and whenever Anne met them together.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to Miss Brown as if she could understand it all so well: she, who
                        was slow in understanding others, felt as if she knew Hamlin’s character as
                        her own father must have known the construction and working of the machines
                        which she remembered seeing him continually taking to pieces and setting up
                        again. Hamlin had been, so Anne thought, obliged to admit to himself that he
                        loved his<pb n="160" xml:id="VAB7109-157"/> cousin, and that he had made her
                        love him; and he was depressed and irritated at his own inability to take
                        any decided course, at his humiliation in finding that this was the end of
                        all his romance with Anne, at his dread of being obliged, sooner or later,
                        to tell Anne the truth; nay, Miss Brown thought she knew Hamlin sufficiently
                        well to be persuaded that there entered into his feelings a certain
                        annoyance at having to forfeit the exotic and unhealthy pleasure of being
                        partially in love with two women at a time, and at the impetuosity of Sacha
                        precipitating matters from a position of hesitation and self‐reproach, which
                        was in some ways pleasant to his peculiar temper, into a situation requiring
                        a definite and prompt solution.</p>
                    <p>Oh, Anne had not suffered silently these two years, without getting to
                        understand the strange character to which her suffering was due. Yes, she
                        knew Hamlin and what was passing in his mind; and the sense of power implied
                        in this knowledge, the power of following all<pb n="161" xml:id="VAB7109-158"/> that he felt and thought, gave her a sort of
                        pleasure, proportionate to that very sense of her difficulty in
                        understanding any character save her own; a curious rare pleasure, in which
                        mingled the consciousness of the price at which it had been bought, and the
                        almost ineffable consciousness that this that she was studying concerned her
                        no more; the pleasure, so often talked about, of the man who has escaped the
                        shipwreck and looks down upon the dangerous waters in safety. Yes; she was
                        safe; she was free.</p>
                    <p>It gave her a morbid pleasure also to watch Madame Elaguine, who, in the last
                        month or so, ever since the quarrel with Edmund Lewis and the consequent
                        intimacy with her cousin, had suddenly changed in her manner towards
                        Anne—had shown a half‐savage, half‐childish desire to parade her conquest
                        before her rival, to let her see how completely she had taken Hamlin away
                        from her, to humiliate and insult her: the flaunting perversity of a new
                        sultana towards an old one. Anne had hitherto insisted<pb n="162" xml:id="VAB7109-159"/> on thinking that Madame Elaguine was really a very noble little
                        woman, and this revelation of a base wish to wound and humiliate, hurt her
                        at first like some nauseous smell arising suddenly beneath her nostrils. But
                        disgust was soon replaced by that new and secret pleasure in the
                        consciousness of understanding this woman better than she understood
                        herself; by the pleasure in feeling how wasted were all Madame Elaguine’s
                        insults—how startled would not the little woman be, could she but know that
                        every proof of her supremacy over Hamlin was to Miss Brown as each
                        successively sawed‐through window‐bar is to the prisoner pining for the day
                        of deliverance.</p>
                    <p>Anne felt herself getting into so singular a condition of excitement, losing
                        so completely, under the pressure of these conflicting doubts and hopes in
                        the past, of the great joy in the present, all her usual self‐composure and
                        self‐control, that she took fiercely to working, to hurrying in every way
                        through those studies<pb n="163" xml:id="VAB7109-160"/> which she had long
                        since begun in the sickening often‐deferred hope that they might become her
                        livelihood if she should ever be released from Hamlin. Miss Brown had often
                        and often, even when the sense of hopelessness had been bitterest, consoled
                        herself with what she believed to be unrealisable dreams for the future; and
                        after going through many possible plans, she had decided that if—if—she
                        should ever become her own mistress, she would employ, resolutely determined
                        to return it to him some day, part of the money which Hamlin had settled
                        upon her, in entering Girton or Newnham, where she would train herself to
                        become a teacher in a public school. Almost mechanically, her studies (and
                        restlessness, and the desire for something that should not be the harassing
                        reality, had developed in her a perfect passion for study) fell into this
                        programme. She had gone in for political economy, history, and what people
                        are pleased to call moral sciences.</p>
                    <p>Now that liberty seemed on the point of<pb n="164" xml:id="VAB7109-161"/>
                        being realised, and that she felt the want of something to steady her shaken
                        nature, she applied herself to this work with redoubled ardour.</p>
                    <p>“If you go on like that you will get seedy, Annie,” warned the practical
                        Marjory Leigh, now on the eve of becoming Mrs Harry Collett.</p>
                    <p>And Marjory Leigh proved right. The secret excitement of the last months,
                        joined to the recent overwork, was too much for Anne. One day she was
                        suddenly taken ill, and a little time later she was delirious.</p>
                    <p>“Nervous prostration from overwork,” said the doctors.</p>
                    <p>A great remorse, which was at the same time a great triumph, rose up in
                        Hamlin’s heart.</p>
                    <p>“Sacha,” he cried, one day as Madame Elaguine came into the studio at
                        Hammersmith, after visiting the sick woman, “it is I who am killing Anne;
                        and it is you—you—who are forcing me to do it,”—and he tore the<pb n="165" xml:id="VAB7109-162"/> portrait of Madame Elaguine off the board of his
                        easel, and pulled the paper, in long ribbons, through his fingers.</p>
                    <p>“It’s no great harm,” said the Russian, quietly; “I’m not quite such a guy as
                        you represented me, Watty, and I’m the better pleased not to go down to
                        posterity like that. As to Anne, don’t flatter yourself you are breaking her
                        heart, for the excellent reason that there is none to break. Too much study!

                    <p>Madame Elaguine watched Hamlin as she let these words drop, then she burst

                    <p><hi>ON</hi> recovering from that long delirium, during which she had raved
                        only about the past and the future, about Miss Curzon, the Perrys, the Villa
                        Arnolfini, Cousin Dick, Girton College, and political economy, but never—by
                        some singular obliviousness of the present—about Hamlin and Sacha,—the first
                        persons that Anne Brown recognised about her were the Leigh girls. Marjory
                        had postponed her marriage in order to help her sister in nursing Miss
                        Brown; and Mrs Macgregor had gladly accepted their proposal to settle for
                        the time being in the house at Hammersmith, she herself being far too
                        unpractical to be of any use. Anne’s impressions were vague, diffuse; the
                        ideas aud sensations, the slight amount of life<pb n="168" xml:id="VAB7109-165"/> of one day of early convalescence being, so to
                        speak, diluted into what were really days and weeks, day and night
                        succeeding each other confusedly to the girl, but feebly awake and for ever
                        falling asleep. It was a dream, but a pleasant one, consisting of veiled
                        misty impressions, separated by tracts of lethargy: impressions of the kind
                        faces and voices of Mary and Marjory, of the gleams of sunshine on the
                        carpet, of the waving of treetops outside the window, of the whistle of the
                        steamboat on the Thames; the song of the canary in the housekeeper’s
                        room—the cry of the milkman; of the bunches of big red and yellow roses put
                        down upon the sheet before her; of the broth and jelly and tea feebly
                        refused, and yet greedily swallowed,—trifles, nothings, but transformed by
                        the haze of mixed weakness and relief into things possessing a charm, and
                        never to be forgotten.</p>
                    <p>The mere sense of rest and renovation constituted a sort of happiness, with
                        which mingled the consciousness of the kindness of those<pb n="169" xml:id="VAB7109-166"/> round her,—of the Leigh girls and Mrs Macgregor,
                        who were in her room nearly all day; of Mrs Spencer, who came from the other
                        end of London every afternoon; of Chough and Cousin Dick, who came to make
                        inquiries; even of Hamlin, whose magnificent bundles and baskets of flowers
                        and fruit arrived regularly, together with the bunch of sweet‐peas and pinks
                        which Chough had bought at the greengrocer’s, or the sprigs of laburnum
                        which he had stolen in the park. Everything in the world seemed so good and
                        simple; all worries and doubts had gone with the dreadful visions of the
                        delirious nights. Anne had never in her life felt so simply, completely
                        happy; perhaps because, with her tense and tragic character, perfect
                        happiness was possible only in weakness and vagueness.</p>
                    <p>Little by little the past became concrete once more; but it became concrete
                        as the past, all her doubts and difficulties remaining far distant behind
                        her, like the Alps which the traveller has arduously crossed, and looks
                            back<pb n="170" xml:id="VAB7109-167"/> upon from the warm Lombard plain.
                        She took up her position and feelings where she had left them: she felt
                        herself free. At first she could scarcely tell why, as we sometimes can
                        scarcely account to ourselves for something which has happened the previous
                        day, and which, though forgotten, fills us with vague pleasure or pain on
                        awakening. Then she began to understand once more, and to add to her
                        recollections what she could make out of the present. She noticed that the
                        Leighs scarcely ever spoke of Hamlin; that they brought in his flowers,
                        books, and messages with a certain constraint, even, she thought, with an
                        occasional look of disgust and indignation. And they never, never once
                        mentioned Madame EIaguine.</p>
                    <p>“What has become of Sacha Elaguine?” she asked one day, rolling her head,
                        with face even paler than before, and black crisp hair just beginning to
                        cluster after cropping short, on the pillows. “Has she gone out of town? You
                        have never spoken about her, Mary.”</p>
                    <pb n="171" xml:id="VAB7109-168"/>
                    <p>Mary Leigh, who was seated, holding Anne’s thin white hand, did not raise her
                        head; and Marjory, who was pouring out the tea hard by, flushed scarlet.</p>
                    <p>“Haven’t I? Oh yes, I must,” answered Mary Leigh, still keeping her eyes on
                        the pattern of the carpet. “Madame Elaguine? Oh, she’s just as usual.”</p>
                    <p>“Odious little brute,” scowled Marjory.</p>
                    <p>Mary raised her head sharply, and gave her sister a look of reproof.</p>
                    <p>Anne asked no more. She had understood: during her illness Sacha had
                        tightened her hold on Hamlin; the Leighs had seen it, or been told, and Mary
                        was afraid lest her sister should let out to the invalid what she imagined
                        to be a heart‐breaking secret.</p>
                    <p>“I am free!” thought Anne; and repeated these words to herself every time
                        that one of the Leighs spoke coldly of Hamlin, or looked savage when he was
                        mentioned. And sometimes she fancied that she could distinguish in the face
                        and manner of the true‐hearted Mary,<pb n="172" xml:id="VAB7109-169"/> of
                        the indignant Marjory, the pain and perplexity of foreseeing that they
                        possessed a terrible secret, that they must make a terrible revelation.
                        Once, she felt sure, Mary’s heart had almost burst for her silence. Miss
                        Leigh had brought in Hamlin’s usual gift of flowers, a bunch of beautiful
                        white roses and jasmine; she was going to hand it to Anne, when her face
                        suddenly contracted, and she stuffed the flowers roughly into a jar.</p>
                    <p>“Won’t you let me smell Mr Hamlin’s flowers, Mary?” asked Anne from her
                        bed.</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh gave her a long strange look.</p>
                    <p>“They aren’t fit for you, Anne,” said Mary, in a hoarse voice; “they’re
                        horrible, morbid sort of things—they’ll just make your head ache.”</p>
                    <p>“My head is much stronger than you think,” said Anne; “let me have them—they
                        are lovely. The jasmine doesn’t smell like ordinary jasmine. What is it?—it
                        smells like the incense that Sacha Elaguine burns in her boudoir; it’s nice,
                        but too strong. I<pb n="173" xml:id="VAB7109-170"/> wonder whether they have
                        been in her boudoir to catch it. It’s very kind of Mr Hamlin to bring them
                        to me, especially as”—Anne looked up with a smile which frightened Mary
                        Leigh out of her wits—“he doesn’t care a bit about me any longer, you
                        know.”</p>
                    <p>Mary Leigh threw herself on her knees before Anne’s bed, and drawing her head
                        to her, kissed her.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Annie, Annie, my darling!” she cried.</p>
                    <p>“You are good,” answered Anne—“you are good to love me so. But Mr Hamlin is
                        also very good, although he doesn’t love me. I am very happy—so happy, Mary
                        dear.”</p>
                    <p>“She is mad,” thought Mary, in terror, as Anne threw her head back, smiling,
                        her onyx‐grey eyes beaming, on the pillow. And she resolved that, as long as
                        she could help, Anne Brown should not know what she knew, and what, every
                        time that Hamlin’s name was mentioned, sickened her heart.</p>
                    <p>Some days later Miss Brown was sufficiently well to exchange her bed for a
                        couch in the<pb n="174" xml:id="VAB7109-171"/> drawing‐room down‐stairs; and
                        then Hamlin asked whether he might be admitted to see her for a few minutes.
                        He seemed painfully impressed at the sight of Anne, whom he was accustomed
                        to see looking the embodiment of physical strength, a sort of primeval
                        warrior‐woman, stretched out on the sofa, so thin and hollow‐checked, so
                        pale, with a pallor quite different from the natural opaque ivory pallor of
                        her complexion; so weak of voice and gesture, so wholly despoiled, it seemed
                        to him, of her usual sombre haughtiness: resigned, and with the gentleness
                        of a sick child. He was silent and depressed, as a man might be who knew her
                        to be more seriously ill than she thought; and yet, as Anne was well aware,
                        it was most obvious to him and to every one that she was entirely out of
                        danger, and rapidly recovering. Miss Brown understood: he was weighed down,
                        but with a worse conscience than Mary Leigh,—by the thought that this woman
                        was unaware of the sort of treachery which was being committed behind her
                            back.<pb n="175" xml:id="VAB7109-172"/> Anne, on the other hand, felt
                        more really pleased to see him than she had done this long time past; it
                        seemed as if, now that the bond which tied her to him was loosened, she
                        could see once more all that was amiable and noble in him,—that she could
                        like him again, feel towards him simply, naturally, as towards a friend and
                        benefactor. And she felt sorry for his depression, for what she imagined to
                        be his self‐reproach; desirous of telling him almost, then and there, that
                        he need not make himself unhappy, that he was free to love his cousin.</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown was still unfit for much conversation; and Hamlin seemed glad to
                        cut short the interview. She asked him to raise one of the blinds; and when
                        the light streamed upon his face, she thought she saw in it something
                        unusual, something beyond his mere usual melancholy, a lassitude and look of
                        being worried; again she felt sorry for him.</p>
                    <p>“How is your cousin Sacha?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“She is well,” he answered briefly, “and<pb n="176" xml:id="VAB7109-173"/>
                        —sends you many messages. I don’t let her come, because she would excite
                        you. Goodbye.”</p>
                    <p>Every afternoon Hamlin returned for a short time. Anne’s first impression was
                        merely strengthened; Hamlin was extraordinarily depressed, worried‐looking,
                        taciturn. Anne felt really sorry for him; he was evidently, she thought,
                        eating his heart out in doubts and self‐reproach; he had gone too far with
                        Sacha to retreat, and yet his engagement to Miss Brown forbade his taking a
                        decisive step. After all, he was truer and nobler than she had thought, more
                        of her real Hamlin of former days; she reflected that this hostility of
                        temperament and aims between them, this long and sickening endurance of a
                        bond which suited neither, had made her unjust and bitter towards him, prone
                        to seek for only his worse sides, neglectful of his good ones. She felt that
                        it was not the least benefit of her release that she could now be perfectly
                        grateful once more; that she could give to this man the<pb n="177" xml:id="VAB7109-174"/> affection which he really deserved, and which she
                        really felt, now that the terrible debt of love was cancelled. She was
                        sorry, very sorry for him, and determined that, since he had not the heart,
                        it was for her to speak. But invariably, and as if warned by a secret
                        intuition, he had interrupted the conversation, and gone away whenever she
                        had been on the point of speaking. The bare name of Madame Elaguine seemed
                        enough to send him away; and yet, whenever Anne succeeded in making him
                        speak of his cousin, he had spoken of her with a strange bitterness, and
                        almost disgust.</p>
                    <p>“He is mean, after all,” thought Anne; “he is angry with poor Sacha for being
                        the cause of his finding himself in a false position.” And she determined
                        that she would speak, not to him but to Madame Elaguine; she felt that she
                        could not endure the way in which he would assuredly seek to whitewash
                        himself at his cousin’s expense. Mean, very mean; nay, something more than
                        mean. What irritation or hypocrisy could induce him to speak<pb n="178" xml:id="VAB7109-175"/> of the woman whom he loved with a sort of
                        constant innuendo, a constant sort of undercurrent of disgust?</p>
                    <p>And again she began to despise and dislike him. Another thing soon struck
                        her. There was something unusual about Hamlin’s appearance. Somewhat
                        effeminate he had always been in his aristocratic refinement; but now it
                        seemed to her as if there were in his face a something, half physical, half
                        spiritual, a vague, helpless, half‐stupefied look, which made her think of
                        that hysterical tippling little poet Dennistoun, whom she disliked so much.
                        Her mind reverted to what she had heard about Edmund Lewis having, at one
                        period, induced Hamlin to take opium.</p>
                    <p>“Is Mr Lewis back?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin flushed all over.</p>
                    <p>“Lewis is not likely to return,” he answered briefly.</p>
                    <p>What was the meaning of it all? Hamlin was also, she noticed, no longer as
                        careful in his dress as he had formerly been; there was<pb n="179" xml:id="VAB7109-176"/> something vaguely rowdy about him. And once, as
                        he stooped over her to rearrange the cushions under her head, it seemed to
                        her—was it true or not?—that she felt a sickening whiff, like those which
                        she well remembered since her childhood, when her father had come in from
                        drinking and taken her on his knees.</p>
                    <p>Was it possible that Hamlin, weak as he was, and feeling himself cornered in
                        a false position, had taken to drinking—to drinking, which had been the
                        fatal vice of his family, of his brother, father, and of his uncles, in
                        order to rid himself of his worries?</p>
                    <p>She must speak to Madame Elaguine. She must let them know that they were
                        free.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p><hi>WHILE</hi> she was in this perplexity about Hamlin, Miss Brown received a
                        visit from her cousin Dick. She had scarcely seen him, and never alone,
                        since that memorable walk home from Professor Richmond’s lecture. Whether
                        from the sense that he had gone too far, that his violence had offended and
                        frightened her; or whether, more probably, from his having rushed to the
                        conclusion that she was unattainable and perhaps unworthy of his seeking,
                        Richard Brown had kept studiously out of her way.</p>
                    <p>For the first time in his life he came in with hesitation and almost shyness.
                        He sat down by the side of her arm‐chair, and spoke with a gentleness, a
                        courtesy, that were quite unusual<pb n="181" xml:id="VAB7109-178"/> in him,
                        and had a charm just from their contrast with his downright and gruff
                        personality. The conversation rolled upon various indifferent subjects; he
                        seemed to be feeling his way to something, trying to decide whether she was
                        strong enough to admit of his saying something which weighed on his
                        mind.</p>
                    <p>“You are nearly recovered now?” he asked. “Do you feel as if you were getting
                        your strength back, Anne?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes,” she answered; “I feel wonderfully well. I have been for a drive
                        these last few days, and I am sure I could walk, if only they would let me.
                        I only feel very tired and lazy every now and then.”</p>
                    <p>There was a pause.</p>
                    <p>“Do you remember what you told me that afternoon when we walked home from
                        Richmond’s lecture—a rainy day at the end of March?” he asked suddenly.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
                    <p>“You said, if you remember, that you did not care for Mr Hamlin, and that you
                            felt<pb n="182" xml:id="VAB7109-179"/> yourself bound to him only by
                        gratitude and the sense that he wanted you—do you remember, Nan?”</p>
                    <p>“I remember perfectly. Well?”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown had spoken slowly and watching her face; and he seemed
                        surprised at the perfect calm which he read in it.</p>
                    <p>“Well, I think it is right that you should know what is by this time known by
                        all your acquaintances. Walter Hamlin no longer wants you; he has entirely
                        thrown you over for another woman. He is—I don’t know exactly what to call
                        it, and don’t mean any innuendo—well—the accepted lover of Madame
                        Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>Anne nodded.</p>
                    <p>“I know it,” she answered coolly. “I have known it, or at least guessed it,
                        since a long while.”</p>
                    <p>Richard was surprised, and, unconsciously perhaps to himself, mortified. He
                        had always resented his cousin’s fidelity to Hamlin, had always, with his
                        tendency to seek for base<pb n="183" xml:id="VAB7109-180"/> motives wherever
                        he could not sympathise, suspected that this fidelity was a mere cover for
                        an unworthy love of the fine æsthetic gentleman or for his fortune and
                        position; and he had anticipated a certain pleasure in seeing Anne wince
                        beneath his revelation.</p>
                    <p>“It is no business of mine to pass a judgment over Mr Hamlin,” he proceeded
                        slowly, and wondering, suspicious as he always was with women, of the
                        genuineness of Anne’s imperturbability; “the whole business seems to me
                        quite consonant with all my notions of his character.”</p>
                    <p>“I do not think Mr Hamlin has acted dishonourably towards me,” put in Anne,
                        quietly; “on the contrary, I feel sure that he reproaches himself much more
                        than he need.”</p>
                    <p>“Very likely. What I was going to say is merely that this new turn which
                        matters have taken necessarily implies an entire change in your position
                        towards Mr Hamlin. He no longer wants you; you are therefore free. Am I
                        correct in my view of the case?”</p>
                    <pb n="184" xml:id="VAB7109-181"/>
                    <p>He was speaking with a deference to her opinion quite new in him.</p>
                    <p>“As far as I can judge,” answered Anne, playing with a big lapis‐lazuli
                        rosary which she had taken off her neck, “I think you are quite correct,
                        Dick. I believe I am free.”</p>
                    <p>She hesitated and spoke the last words almost inaudibly, as if
                        superstitiously afraid that they should be heard.</p>
                    <p>“In that case I presume you will have to remodel your life. Have you thought
                        of any plans?”</p>
                    <p>“I have thought over the matter a good deal. My intention, as soon as Mr
                        Hamlin and I have come to an explanation, which will be shortly, is to go to
                        Ireland for a few months with Mary Leigh, to finish getting well and to
                        finish some preparatory work, and then to go up to Girton. I should be able
                        to pass the entrance examination in another three months. You see,” she
                        added, “Mr Hamlin, in spending the money that he has in turning me into<pb n="185" xml:id="VAB7109-182"/> a lady, has made it difficult for me to
                        take to any such livelihood as would have naturally been mine under other
                        circumstances; and I think, therefore, that I have a right to invest a
                        portion of the money which he has settled upon me, and which he fully
                        intended me to keep in any ease, in qualifying myself for the only sort of
                        business for which I am now fit. He has settled upon me the equivalent of
                        five hundred a‐year, apart from the expenses of this house, of which I know
                        nothing. Much less than that would more than cover the expenses of keeping
                        me at Girton and of starting me as a teacher or journalist; and once fairly
                        started, I hope I should be able to support myself and gradually to refund
                        this money. Do you think that would be fair, Dick? You see, it is quite
                        useless for me to think of ever repaying, even if money could repay in such
                        matters, what Mr Hamlin has spent upon me during all these years.”</p>
                    <p>She seemed to hesitate, to be afraid of being<pb n="186" xml:id="VAB7109-183"/> mean, of appearing to take advantage of Hamlin’s generosity.</p>
                    <p>“Do you really contemplate renouncing the fortune which Mr Hamlin settled on
                        you? giving up all the luxury to which he has accustomed you, Annie?”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown, disinterested though he was, was too deeply impressed with the
                        mercenary temper of mankind, to believe very easily in such sentiments.</p>
                    <p>“Why, of course,” answered Anne. “When Mr Hamlin marries his cousin, he will
                        find, that he has not too much with all his money. And I would certainly not
                        keep any of it as soon as I could do without; though heaven knows I am not
                        ungrateful, nor so silly as to fancy that I should be in the very least
                        lightening my obligation towards him.”</p>
                    <p>Richard did not answer for a moment. “Listen,” he said, not without
                        hesitation “I am nearer to you than Walter Hamlin and whatever I am, I owe
                        it to your father. I find I have just made a very considerable<pb n="187" xml:id="VAB7109-184"/> and quite unexpected profit off some mining shares which Mr
                        Gillespie left me. Let me advance you out of this money whatever may be
                        wanted to defray your expenses at college; you will repay me when you find
                        it convenient. In this way, you will be entirely independent of Mr Hamlin at
                        once: you can let him have all his money.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown hesitated, in a way very singular in his cut‐and‐dry nature; he
                        seemed prepared for a rebuff.</p>
                    <p>“You are very kind, Dick; but I can’t accept your offer. I owe it to Mr
                        Hamlin, in return for all the generosity he has shown towards me and would
                        still show, that I should never accept anything from any man but him, even
                        if I were not resolved never to put myself under such an obligation again. I
                        have no right to prefer your generosity to his.”</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown was silent. Then, after a moment, they fell to talking about
                        the plans and theories which occupied Cousin Dick’s mind. He was unusually
                        gentle and modest;<pb n="188" xml:id="VAB7109-185"/> he really seemed to be
                        losing some of that narrowness which had been the ugly side of his powerful
                        and upright nature.</p>
                    <p>“You are becoming quite tolerant, Dick,” remarked Anne. “Six months ago you
                        could never have conceived that any one unlike yourself or differing from
                        your views could have anything good in him. I am very glad; it will make you
                        more hopeful of the world, and show you a lot of energy and good faith which
                        deserves to be united to your own, and which you would formerly have thrown
                        upon the dust‐heap.”</p>
                    <p>“You are right,” answered Brown. “I feel that I have diminished my own
                        usefulness by not admitting any other kind of usefulness than my own. I
                        often catch myself thinking, now, that my great danger lies in my tendency
                        to underrate people; sometimes it seems as if, unless I can struggle against
                        it, it will invade and sterilise my whole nature.”</p>
                    <p>“I am so glad you feel like that, Dick.”</p>
                    <p>“And do you know,” he continued, “I<pb n="189" xml:id="VAB7109-186"/> think
                        this change is due to you; knowing you has shown me how horribly
                        unreasonable and unjust I am apt to be in my preconceived notions. I really
                        did think you an æsthete once, Annie; nay, at one time, I was so base as to
                        think that you were base, that you cared for Hamlin’s position and money and
                        good looks, while not caring for him. Will you forgive me, Annie?”</p>
                    <p>He bent over her, and took her hand. She let him hold it for a minute. She
                        felt so strangely free, so safe, so happy somehow with this man, whose
                        presence had so often been a threat and an insult.</p>
                    <p>“I wonder whether you will ever learn to be just to Mr Hamlin,” she
                        mused.</p>
                    <p>“I will do my best.”</p>
                    <p>She had withdrawn her hand from his.</p>
                    <p>“I wonder whether I have ever been just to Mr Hamlin,” said Anne.</p>
                    <p>Richard reddened.</p>
                    <p>“What makes you say that, Nan?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know. I feel how difficult it is<pb n="190" xml:id="VAB7109-187"/>
                        for a nature like mine to be just towards, to understand, any one outside
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>“Can you be just towards me?” he suddenly asked.</p>
                    <p>“I am, I think.”</p>
                    <p>“Do you think, then,” went on Richard Brown, “that during the time you spend
                        at Girton you could try a little and understand me,—you could try and like
                        me a little, Annie?”</p>
                    <p>“I do like you, Richard,” she answered coldly; but a quiet happiness, like
                        that of a windless, half‐covered morning in the fields, stole over her.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean this,” he said, rising. “I want you to like me, Nan, as much—as
                        much as you thought you liked Walter Hamlin.”</p>
                    <p>Anne shook her head sadly.</p>
                    <p>“That is quite impossible,” she said: “one doesn’t feel like that twice, I
                        fancy, Richard, any more than one believes twice in angels or such
                        things.”</p>
                    <pb n="191" xml:id="VAB7109-188"/>
                    <p>Richard Brown frowned. She could never pluck Hamlin, Hamlin in some shape,
                        real or false, out of her heart.</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye,” he said; “I fear I have tired you. Annie,” he added, “it is
                        idiotic, isn’t it? but all the time you were ill, even until I came into
                        this room, I kept hoping that you might have lost your looks—that Hamlin
                        might be quite unable ever to care for you again—that you might have ceased
                        to be, in this sort of way, above me. And yet, when I saw you, I was glad it
                        was not so. Oh, Nan, promise me you will try and like me a little.”</p>
                    <p>“Please don’t say that, Dick. I have been a slave, a prisoner. Can’t you
                        understand that my great joy is the sense of my freedom, my sense of
                        belonging to no one, caring about no one? Can’t you understand that it seems
                        horrible to me to even think that I could ever care for any one again? Can’t
                        you let me enjoy my liberty, at least until I have realised that it isn’t a
                        dream?”</p>
                    <pb n="192" xml:id="VAB7109-189"/>
                    <p>She spoke with impetuosity, but gently; and her cousin did not feel
                        rebuked.</p>
                    <p>“By the way,” he said, “I suppose you have heard who is expected here
                        soon—your old friend, Melton Perry.”</p>
                    <p>“Melton Perry!” cried Anne. It seemed such centuries since she had heard that
                        name last. “Oh, I shall be so glad to see him, he is such a good man!”</p>
                    <p>She walked up and down after Dick had left.</p>
                    <p>Melton Perry! the name brought up the far, far distant past—a vision of the
                        untidy house at Florence; of Mrs Perry’s lean and Sapphic profile; of the
                        tall grass and crushed herbs in the vineyard of the Villa Arnolfini; of
                        Hamlin as she had first known him—a mysterious, unattainable ideal high
                        above her; of the studio at the top of the tower; of herself, as she
                        recollected herself to have been, a sombre, unhappy creature, with whose
                        identity she seemed to have no connection, and into<pb n="193" xml:id="VAB7109-190"/> whose dark and confused mind she felt unable to
                        see. There was something very painful in this sudden return of the past in
                        company with her old friend, and Anne thought bitterly of the difference
                        between the dreams of happiness, so positive, so perfect, of those days, and
                        the reality of happiness, so negative, so poor—consisting in what? in being
                        left to herself—which belonged to her now. And yet, after all, as she looked
                        into her girlhood before Hamlin’s coming, she recognised the same
                        negativeness; she had wished to be free, to be a daily governess, to depend
                        upon no one for her livelihood, to be able to know something of a wider
                        life. She had never hoped, scarcely even wished, for happiness; the
                        semblance of it had passed before her eyes, had, for a brief time, made her
                        life more acutely sensitive; but she returned to the negative: it was the
                        law of her life.</p>
                    <p>And, as she cleared her mind of all vain regrets, she became aware that, in a
                            manner,<pb n="194" xml:id="VAB7109-191"/> this return upon her scene of
                        Melton Perry was like the ringing of the bell, the orchestral flourish,
                        which ends a piece as it has begun it. The comedy of her love for Hamlin,
                        and of Hamlin’s love for her, was over; and she felt impatient for Melton
                        Perry’s arrival.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> day after this visit from Cousin Dick, came the first visit from
                        Madame Elaguine. It seemed to Anne that, from the very moment of her
                        entering the room, she could perceive something strange in Sacha’s
                        manner—something brazen, flaunting, cruel. The little woman somehow no
                        longer looked so small and that childish appealingness had entirely left her
                        manner; she was self‐possessed, cynical, triumphant. Her very dress was
                        different from anything in which Miss Brown had hitherto seen her; exotic
                        indeed and fantastic, like everything that she wore, but certainly not
                        turned out by Madame Elaguine’s maid. She kissed Anne familiarly on both
                        cheeks, enveloping her in an atmosphere of heady Eastern perfumes.</p>
                    <pb n="196" xml:id="VAB7109-193"/>
                    <p>“Poor Annie,” she said, “you have been very ill, and must have thought me a
                        great brute for not coming to see you before. But Walter absolutely forbade
                        my coming—stood in front of your door, so to speak, and shut it in my face.
                        He pretended that I should have excited you too much. Perhaps I should; I am
                        a wretched, excitable creature. Perhaps he was right; what do you think?”
                        Madame Elaguine fixed her eyes on those of Anne; a long look of scrutiny and
                        triumph, as if she had expected to see her wince.</p>
                    <p>“I think Mr Hamlin was quite mistaken,” answered Miss Brown quietly,
                        understanding the meaning of that look. “I am much less subject to
                        excitement than he supposes; and your presence would not have excited me
                        more than any one else’s.”</p>
                    <p>“Really!” and Madame Elaguine’s mouth took a peculiar little sneering turn;
                        “I should have thought that I <emph>was</emph> exciting, now. Not more
                        exciting, for instance, than the Miss Leighs? or than your cousin, Mr
                            Richard<pb n="197" xml:id="VAB7109-194"/> Brown?” and she again looked
                        scrutinisingly at Anne, who merely shook her head. “By the way, your cousin
                        has quite cut me of late, Annie—ask him why. I suspect that he thinks me a
                        dangerous woman, quite without moral ballast,—what my German teacher used to
                        call <foreign xml:lang="ger">Sittlicher Ernst</foreign>. He was such a funny
                        creature that German teacher of mine; did I ever tell you about him? He
                        taught at the school where I was in Petersburg: a thin lank creature, with
                        long red wrists projecting a yard from his sleeves, and a waistcoat which
                        would ride up whenever he was excited; he used to lean against the wall, any
                        part of his body at random, and bend and sway the rest of him about, like a
                        caterpillar. He taught us German literature, and was very shocked because I
                        said the ‘Bride of Corinth’ was the only amusing thing Goethe had ever
                        written. He believed in Schopenhauer—and hated women, and me in particular,
                        because I had no <foreign xml:lang="ger">Sittlicher Ernst</foreign>; and one
                        day, what do you think he did? he fell on his knees and tried<pb n="198" xml:id="VAB7109-195"/> to catch me round the waist. Poor devil! he was
                        turned out of doors, and drowned himself later. I wonder whether it was out
                        of despair at my want of <foreign xml:lang="ger">Sittlicher Ernst</foreign>?
                        He was such a queer creature. I sometimes think, after all, he was the only
                        man I could really have loved, if only his waistcoat had not ridden up, and
                        his wrists projected so much from his cuffs.”</p>
                    <p>Sacha laughed, and bit her lower lip a little, so that it suddenly became
                        scarlet, like the lips of Edmund Lewis. She threw herself back in her chair,
                        one foot crossed over the other, her eyes fixed on the Venetian chandelier,
                        which caught opalescent lights in the sunshine; she was smiling, perhaps in
                        recollection of the professor with his wrists and his waistcoat.</p>
                    <p>Anne did not know what to say; the presence of this woman seemed to freeze
                        her, like the contact of some clammy thing: it was as if the soul of Edmund
                        Lewis had entered her body and had become more active, more<pb n="199" xml:id="VAB7109-196"/> subtle in its new habitation. Mechanically her
                        eyes rested upon Madame Elaguine’s dress, a marvellous vague thing, made in
                        some confused resemblance of the men’s dress of Moliére’s time,—a crimson
                        plush coat and a big man’s cravat of Flanders lace, but all bursting out, by
                        every conceivable slashing and gap, into a mass of lace, which hung about
                        her like a cloud of thistle‐down, beneath which her thin and nervous little
                        body seemed to twist and writhe with every word.</p>
                    <p>“It’s a pretty frock, isn’t it?” she remarked, looking down upon it with
                        satisfaction. “Oh no, I didn’t make this; I am bored with always making my
                        own frocks. It’s from Worth. I swore I would bring round Watty from belief
                        in pre‐Adamitic skirts and purfled sleeves and eighteen‐penny medievalism to
                        a belief in Worth; you know he used always to rant at Paris clothes. Well,
                        I’ve been as good as my word; this is from Worth, and what’s more, Walter
                        has paid my bill. Humiliating, rather, isn’t it? but then, you see, I’m a
                            pauper,<pb n="200" xml:id="VAB7109-197"/> and can’t buy Worth frocks on
                        a thousand a‐year, including subscription for a copy of Chough’s new
                        translation of ‘Villon,’ with all the improprieties annotated, Dutch paper,
                        morocco, rough edges, price three guineas, can I?”</p>
                    <p>Anne flushed. Hamlin had paid for Sacha’s dress! And yet, had Hamlin not paid
                        for not merely one, but all Anne’s dresses these years—nay, for everything
                        that Anne saw about her—nay, for everything almost that Anne knew and was?
                        And still, how was it, there was a difference? and as she looked at Sacha in
                        her fantastic Molière coat of crimson plush and watered white silk and lace,
                        which Hamlin had paid for, she could not get out of her mind the image of
                        certain French kept women whom she had seen, in their elaborate dresses and
                        well‐appointed victorias, driving in the Park. It was very unjust and
                        horrible, yet she could not get it out of her mind.</p>
                    <p>“Walter is a queer creature,” went on Madame Elaguine; “somewhat like my German<pb n="201" xml:id="VAB7109-198"/> caterpillar professor: I don’t mean in the matter of wrists and
                        waistcoats, but in the matter of women. I don’t know how to say it; my ideas
                        aren’t ever very clear: I suppose it’s want of <foreign xml:lang="ger">Sittlicher Ernst</foreign>, and also because I’m hysterical—at least
                        the doctors say so; because I insist on having my own way. I mean that
                        Walter, for instance, hates me in a certain sense just as that professor
                        did. I’m sure he sometimes feels as if he could throttle me, because I have
                        no <foreign xml:lang="ger">Sittlicher Ernst</foreign>, and because I made
                        love to him, and offered him barley‐sugar and tops when I was ten. And yet!
                        Ah, well, I suppose I am a wretch! Oh, Annie dear, I fear, I fear I am a
                        wretch!” and Madame Elaguine suddenly jumped up from her chair and flung her
                        arms round Miss Brown’s neck and kissed her, with such violence that Anne
                        felt her lips almost like leeches and her teeth pressing into her
                        cheeks.</p>
                    <p>“Oh Annie, I am an unworthy wretch! I am a beast towards you!” she cried.</p>
                    <p>Anne felt a horror, a kind of fear of death;<pb n="202" xml:id="VAB7109-199"/> and yet she felt sorry for this woman; was she not a wretch in not
                        clearing up the position—in letting this woman continue to love in shame,
                        when she might love openly and honourably? She loosened herself from Sacha’s
                        embrace.</p>
                    <p>“Madame Elaguine” she began, feeling her face still burning from this
                        strangling embrace, and mechanically smoothing her ruffled hair, “I have
                        long wanted to tell you something with regard to Mr Hamlin—indeed I feel I
                        ought to have told it you before, but . . .” At this moment the door opened
                        and Hamlin entered.</p>
                    <p>Anne had missed her opportunity; it was impossible to speak before Hamlin,
                        although she had once or twice contemplated clearing up matters to him and
                        his cousin at the same time. But it was impossible now. Sacha had something
                        strange, brazen, about her, which froze Anne’s soul. Hamlin was listless,
                        depressed, with that hang‐dog, stupefied air that Miss Brown had noticed in
                        him of late. He<pb n="203" xml:id="VAB7109-200"/> spoke little, barely
                        answered any of Sacha’s remarks: every time that he raised his eyes upon his
                        cousin, it was with an expression that amounted almost to disgust; and she
                        seemed nowise hurt, but rather amused and pleased at this look, and took a
                        pleasure in provoking it by a hundred absurdities, and by a sort of bullying
                        way, as if expressly to show her power over this sullen creature.</p>
                    <p>They did not stay long. Madame Elaguine rose, and Hamlin mechanically
                        followed her example: was it that he could not see her go away by herself,
                        or that he was afraid of being left alone with Miss Brown?</p>
                    <p>“This is my first visit to you since your illness, and it will be my last for
                        a little time,” said Madame Elaguine, letting Hamlin help her on with her
                        cloak, and spinning out the operation, as if to show that this depressed and
                        sullen creature, for all his sulkiness, was her slave.</p>
                    <p>“Are you going away?” cried Anne, a sudden fear entering her heart. Sacha noticed<pb n="204" xml:id="VAB7109-201"/> her involuntary flush, and mistook its meaning.</p>
                    <p>“Only for a fortnight,” she answered, with an odd smile. “Oh no; I can’t do
                        without London and my friends—hideous London and disagreeable friends, at
                        least so far as Walter is concerned. I suppose it’s my perversity and want
                        of <foreign xml:lang="ger">Sittlicher Ernst</foreign>, again. I am going to
                        Paris this evening. I have a notion of taking Boris out of his English
                        school and sending him to the Lycée. I feel I have had a surfeit of
                        respectability and æstheticism, and that I’d rather my son were a Frenchman
                        and a Bohemian. It’s a whim. Perhaps it will make me return a frantic
                        Anglomaniac. Fancy if Boris were to grow up a thing like this!” pointing to
                        Hamlin,—“a horrible pseudo Sir Galahad, as Watty was at sixteen. Faugh! I
                        couldn’t bear it. Good‐bye, Annie dear; I fear you must think me an immoral
                        woman, and that my German professor wasn’t so far wrong. Good‐bye, my
                        beautiful Madonna of the Glaciers,” and again Miss Brown was half<pb n="205" xml:id="VAB7109-202"/> stifled in the cloud of oriental perfumes, as
                        Madame Elaguine kissed her cavalierly on both cheeks.</p>
                    <p>“Come along, Watty!” cried Sacha; “can’t you learn to open the door for a
                        woman?”</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye, Miss Brown,” and Hamlin gave a little sigh of weariness as he
                        pressed Anne’s hand.</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown remained in a state of vague fear all that day. Was that love—at
                        least on Hamlin’s part—that look of bored disgust with which he had
                        responded to Madame Elaguine’s provocation? Anne grew pale at the notion of
                        that fortnight of Sacha’s absence. Would Hamlin, fickle, easily wounded in
                        his vanity, sated with Madame Elaguine’s Russian ways, remain faithful to
                        the absent woman? Would he not rather return and begin afresh that old, old
                        story of Platonic adoration, of self‐reproach, with what his cousin called
                        Madonna of the Glaciers? And as Hamlin was leaving, he had said to her half
                        audibly, “If you will allow me, I will come to‐morrow afternoon<pb n="206" xml:id="VAB7109-203"/> and see what can be done to my Vision of
                        Beatrice, if you will give me a sitting.”</p>
                    <p>A sitting! Anne’s heart had sunk at the mere word.</p>
                    <p>But the next morning she found on the tray on which her breakfast was brought
                        up a twisted note. It was from Hamlin, written late the previous night.</p>
                    <p>“DEAR MISS BROWN,” it said,—“I fear you will think me very uncourteous to
                        break through our engagement for to‐morrow morning. But I am feeling rather
                        anxious lest Madame Elaguine should get imposed on about the school for her
                        boy; so I shall join her for a few days in Paris. Pray forgive my apparent
                        rudeness.—Yours sincerely, W. H.”</p>
                    <p>“What’s your news, Annie?” asked Mary Leigh, who had come in to see after her
                        invalid. “You look as if you had come in for a fortune!”</p>
                    <p>Anne made an effort and laughed.</p>
                    <p>“It was only Mr Hamlin postponing a sitting which I was to give him. I
                            really<pb n="207" xml:id="VAB7109-204"/> don’t feel much like sitting
                        yet. Mr Hamlin’s gone to Paris to look after a school for Boris
                        Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>“And Madame Elaguine?”</p>
                    <p>“Madame Elaguine—went yesterday.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, indeed!” answered Mary Leigh; and as she said that, a wave of red came
                        into Miss Brown’s pale face—why, Anne could not herself have explained.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
                    <p><hi>THE</hi> day after Hamlin’s departure to join Madame Elaguine, Richard
                        Brown paid another visit at Hammersmith; and he dropped in frequently in the
                        next few days. He never spoke of his hopes, he never inquired about Anne’s
                        plans; he scarcely so much as alluded to Hamlin’s departure. He seemed
                        satisfied to see his cousin, to explain to her all the things that he hoped
                        some day to do. This forbearance, this delicate discretion, on the part of
                        one of the most tactless and exacting of men; this something which implied
                        that Cousin Dick had learned to consult her wishes, touched Miss Brown very
                        much. Love, or by whatever other name (since the name of love was
                        discredited to Anne) she might<pb n="209" xml:id="VAB7109-206"/> choose to
                        call Richard’s strong and steady feeling, seemed to have purified this
                        powerful and generous temper of that alloy of coarse and contemptuous
                        suspicion that had occasionally repelled her so much.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown had become comparatively quite charitable in his judgments,
                        sincerely anxious to be just. He tried to see things a little from her point
                        of view—nay, even to understand whatever good there was or had been in
                        Hamlin. This big and self‐reliant man, who had already thought and done so
                        much for himself and for others, began to appear to his cousin as less
                        mature than she had fancied, and even less self‐reliant; new instincts and
                        perceptions, new sides of his nature—making it fuller, richer,
                        purer—developing under her influence. Anne did not love her cousin; she did
                        not even anticipate loving him anything as she had once loved Hamlin. She
                        recognised that, in her nature, love could exist only for an ideal, and in
                        an ideal she could never again believe; but she became aware of<pb n="210" xml:id="VAB7109-207"/> a relation of frank comradeship, of mutual
                        respect and attachment and usefulness, which warmed her nature, and made
                        hopes and projects bud and blossom up. She was nervously anxious for that
                        fortnight to have come to an end, to have Hamlin back, to speak to him; and
                        yet, at the same time, it seemed to her dreadful that these few days of
                        freedom from care, freedom from the shadow which had so long hung over her,
                        should so soon come to an end.</p>
                    <p>The fortnight was drawing to a close; Hamlin would soon be back. Anne began
                        to be filled with unendurable impatience; she even, once or twice, began a
                        letter telling him everything, and tore it up only from the fear that it
                        might seem harsh, ungrateful, that it might (and the idea was terrible to
                        her) make him suppose that she was jealous, that she loved him. It was a
                        great relief to her when there suddenly came a telegram, sent on from
                        Hamlin’s lodgings, and opened by his servant, which announced for next
                        evening the arrival<pb n="211" xml:id="VAB7109-208"/> of Melton Perry, who
                        knew nothing of Hamlin’s momentary absence from town.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Aunt Claudia,” cried Anne, “Mr Perry is coming to‐morrow evening! Do you
                        think—oh, do you think you could have him to stay here till Mr Hamlin
                        return?”</p>
                    <p>“Who is Mr Perry?” asked Chough, who was dining with them, suddenly pricking
                        up his ears at Anne’s excited tone. Could <emph>he</emph> be the explanation
                        of Anne’s indifference to Hamlin? thought the poet of the Eternal
                        Feminine.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Perry,” answered Anne, “is the gentleman in whose house I was a servant
                        until I met Mr Hamlin—the father of the little girls whose maid I was. He
                        was very kind to me, and I am very fond of him.”</p>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough stared at her in amazement. He had quite forgotten, indeed he
                        had never properly realised, that this queenly woman, this more than Dante’s
                        Beatrice or Petrarch’s Laura, had actually been a nursemaid—a servant! She a
                        servant! he repeated to himself,<pb n="212" xml:id="VAB7109-209"/> looking
                        at Miss Brown as she sat opposite him; at this goddess, it seemed to him,
                        with the wonderful face as of one of Michelangelo’s Titanesses; the solemn,
                        mysterious, onyx‐grey eyes; the something superhumanly grand in person and
                        movement. To have been a servant, and to remind people of it, was his next
                        thought; and this Cosmo Chough, conscious of his supposed father the duke,
                        and of his real father the apothecary at Limerick, was absolutely unable to
                        comprehend.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Perry, except Miss Curzon, was the only friend I ever had, until—until I
                        met Mr Hamlin,” went on Miss Brown. “You will give him the spare room, Aunt
                        Claudia, for my sake, won’t you? And you will let me arrange it for him, and
                        make it look a little untidy, and put match‐boxes and pipe‐lights about, so
                        that he may feel a little comfortable.”</p>
                    <p>Mrs Macgregor laughed.</p>
                    <p>“Put as many pipe‐lights about as you please, my dear; but if he fill Watty’s
                        studio with pipe‐smoke, you will be responsible, not I.”</p>
                    <pb n="213" xml:id="VAB7109-210"/>
                    <p>The next afternoon Anne Brown was just in the midst of what she called making
                        the spare room look untidy, taking out the superfluous æsthetic furniture
                        which would, she knew, fidget her former master to death, dragging in
                        leather arm‐chairs instead of imitation Queen Anne things, and piling
                        newspapers and novels on the table, when a visitor was announced. She went
                        down into the drawing‐room, and, to her surprise, found Edmund Lewis. An
                        inexpressible sense of disgust came over her, This man personified all that
                        she hated most of that past with which she was about to break for ever. The
                        little man with the auburn beard and sealing‐wax lips was considerably less
                        free‐and‐easy and sultan‐like than usual; his humiliation, whatever it was,
                        had evidently done him good. Indeed, Miss Brown was almost beginning to ask
                        herself whether she might not have been a little unjust towards him also, so
                        respectful and amiable had he made himself, when it began to dawn upon her
                        that there was an explanation<pb n="214" xml:id="VAB7109-211"/> for his
                        visit much more in keeping with the character she had hitherto attributed to
                        him.</p>
                    <p>“I hear that Walter Hamlin is in Paris with his cousin,” he had remarked,
                        after a few minutes’ conversation. He had tried to say it in an off‐hand
                        manner; but Anne had felt his green eyes fixed curiously upon her.</p>
                    <p>“Yes; they have gone to settle about sending Boris to the Lycée.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis hereupon made some remarks about English and French schools, and upon
                        the education of Boris Elaguine; but slowly and dexterously he made the
                        conversation return to Sacha and Hamlin; he made the conspicuous matter no
                        longer the object of Madame Elaguine’s and Hamlin’s journey to Paris, but
                        the journey itself.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t think Madame Elaguine’s Russian relations—her aunt who lives in
                        Paris and Boris’s grandfather—will be particularly pleased at her going
                        about like that with a young man,” he said. “Russians are such corrupt
                        people, they see mischief in everything.”</p>
                    <pb n="215" xml:id="VAB7109-212"/>
                    <p>Anne understood. Edmund Lewis, who always hated her, had been unable to
                        resist the temptation, now that both Hamlin and Sacha were safe out of the
                        way, of seeing the proud Miss Brown wince beneath his compassion. He was
                        artistically playing upon the feelings of humiliation and anger with which
                        he imagined her to be filled.</p>
                    <p>“Madame Elaguine is Mr Hamlin’s cousin, you must remember,” answered Anne,
                        quietly bending over her embroidery.</p>
                    <p>“True; but the people who meet them in Paris won’t know that, or won’t
                        believe it. Besides, it’s not as if they had always lived together and been
                        as brother and sister, as some cousins have. I think Madame Elaguine is very
                        rash to run the risk of unnecessary gossip; and I must say I can’t
                        understand Hamlin being so dense as not to see that he was compromising his
                        cousin, especially as people were beginning to notice his assiduity to his
                        cousin even here. Of course, however,” added Lewis, fixing his eyes on Miss
                            Brown,<pb n="216" xml:id="VAB7109-213"/> “being engaged, to you makes a
                        difference to Hamlin. A man who is engaged to be married may, I suppose, go
                        about with any woman—it is as if he were married. I am very sorry I shall be
                        far away, somewhere in Central Asia or South America—I don’t know where—when
                        your marriage will come off, Miss Brown. I must make my congratulations
                        betimes.”</p>
                    <p>“There is nothing to congratulate about,” answered Anne, quietly; “there has
                        been no question of my marrying Mr Hamlin. I am sorry such an idea should
                        have got abroad. I was, you know, Mr Hamlin’s ward till lately, and I am now
                        taking advantage of his aunt’s kindness to stay here till—till I settle what
                        I am going to do; I may be going to Girton—I don’t know.”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, indeed!” exclaimed Lewis; “pray forgive my unintentional impertinence
                        then. Girton? Ah—How long do you intend remaining there?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know. Nothing is settled yet.”<pb n="217" xml:id="VAB7109-214"/>
                        Anne was determined not to let this man enjoy his impertinence and
                        spitefulness: he should go away baffled.</p>
                    <p>“I may stay there altogether. I should rather like to be a teacher.”</p>
                    <p>“And I,” said Lewis, with one of his would‐be fascinating smiles, “would, in
                        that case, like to be a pupil, Miss Brown.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer. He must be disappointed, she thought. But he was
                        determined to get some satisfaction out of her.</p>
                    <p>“I can’t get over Hamlin’s thoughtlessness in accompanying Madame Elaguine to
                        Paris,” he said. “It would have been so simple to ask some lady to be of the
                        party. I suppose you did not like leaving Mrs Macgregor? I was sorry to hear
                        that she was ailing.”</p>
                    <p>“There was no question of my going,” answered Anne; “and I do think it is
                        such silly nonsense about any one being required. If people choose to think
                        that Mr Hamlin is going to marry his cousin—well, why not? It would be a
                        very natural thing if he did.”</p>
                    <pb n="218" xml:id="VAB7109-215"/>
                    <p>She looked Lewis boldly in the face. It was the first time that she had said
                        the thing which she believed, hoped for, prayed for.</p>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis was evidently staggered; and Anne enjoyed watching his
                        discomfiture. But a thought soon came into his subtle head.</p>
                    <p>“I suppose you see a good deal of Mr Richard Brown?” he asked; “he’s an
                        extraordinarily clever man.”</p>
                    <p>“Yes; he is very able. I see him often enough. At present his electioneering
                        business doesn’t leave him much time.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, to be sure. It costs a lot of money, doesn’t it, to get into Parliament?
                        But I suppose Mr Brown is rich now, is he not?”</p>
                    <p>“He is well off.”</p>
                    <p>“And he is sure to succeed. He has a fine career before him,” mused Lewis. He
                        had, as he thought, grasped the situation: there had been an amicable
                        exchange—Anne was to marry Richard Brown, and Sacha was to have Hamlin. All
                        his enemies—for Sacha and Hamlin had evidently sent him to the right-about<pb n="219" xml:id="VAB7109-216"/>—were going to be happily settled. His paste‐coloured face grew
                        pastier than ever; he bit his scarlet lips and auburn moustache; he looked
                        horribly angry and malignant; wickeder than even Anne, who had always hated
                        him, would have believed it possible.</p>
                    <p>But he kept his temper—nay, he was quite unusually deferential and sweet. He
                        led the conversation to other topics; and Anne thought that his only object
                        was now to talk no more about the affairs which he had so misjudged, when,
                        she scarcely knew how, he began to talk about Wotton Hall—first about the
                        scenery, then about the grounds, then the house, then their stay there, and
                        finally about the incident of the burning bed.</p>
                    <p>He went over all the circumstances of it; he summed up all that he and Anne
                        knew of Madame Elaguine’s persecution; and then, as if discussing a curious
                        psychological problem, he asked her whether it had ever occurred to her that
                        there was any possibility that the persecution should be a fraud, and that
                        the bed<pb n="220" xml:id="VAB7109-217"/> had been set fire to by Madame
                        Elaguine herself. “I don’t know whether you remarked at the time, that the
                        flames burst out just two minutes after Madame Elaguine had fetched the
                        cigarette‐papers out of her room, and that she had given orders to her maid
                        not to come until she should be rung for,” said Lewis; “also, that Madame
                        Elaguine seemed extremely unwilling that any inquiry should be made into the
                        matter afterwards.”</p>
                    <p>Anne said nothing; the recollection of the precious lace‐trimmed
                        dressing‐gown, placed carefully out of the way of the flames, and of that
                        sentence, “And they never forgot, so long as they lived, that terrible
                        burning bed,” which had caught her eye in little Hélène Elaguine’s
                        story‐book, came into her mind. She had put that matter of the persecution
                        behind her of late, and yet in her heart she felt that she believed it to be
                        a fraud.</p>
                    <p>“I have had my doubts about it,” bending over her work lest Lewis should see
                        her face. “Indeed,” she added boldly, indignant at her<pb n="221" xml:id="VAB7109-218"/> own want of frankness, “I am inclined to believe
                        that Madame Elaguine did set that bed on fire. Several things have made me
                        think so.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis smiled. “I am glad to find that you take my view of the case, Miss
                        Brown. The chemist at Appledore—where, if you remember, Madame Elaguine went
                        for some shopping the day before the fire—showed me himself the bottle of
                        acid from which he had helped Madame Elaguine—I forget the name of the
                        stuff—she said she wanted some to take spots out of a dress.”</p>
                    <p>“Indeed,” went on Lewis, “I think that we have in Madame Elaguine a very
                        curious instance of a sort of monomania which has, I believe, its scientific
                        name,”—and Lewis began to retail a variety of instances, culled out of some
                        volume of ‘Causes célèbres,’ of persons who had elaborately made up
                        persecutions of which themselves were victims. He had always been fond of
                        talking as if he knew a great deal about morbid conditions of the brain,
                        and, indeed, morbid things of all sorts; and he<pb n="222" xml:id="VAB7109-219"/> talked for some time as if he took a purely
                        abstract interest in the case.</p>
                    <p>“One is apt to meet very singular types among Russian women, especially such
                        as have led a wandering life like Madame Elaguine,” went on Lewis. “They are
                        devoured by a passion for the forbidden, or at least for the unreal and
                        theatrical; there is something strangely crooked in their moral vision,
                        something discordant in their nature. They are extraordinary, charming,
                        intelligent, depraved creatures. Only a Russian woman could be at once so
                        childish and so theatrical and insincere, so full of idealism and of
                        cynicism, as Madame Elaguine. Ah, she is a wonderful being! That matter of
                        the burning bed finishes her off perfectly.”</p>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis fixed his green magnetic eyes on Anne. He still believed that
                        she must hate Sacha, as it was clear that, for some reason or other, he
                        hated the Russian; and he wished, by giving Miss Brown these notions about
                        Madame Elaguine, to induce<pb n="223" xml:id="VAB7109-220"/> her to revenge
                        herself and him. But Anne had become quite dense to his intentions. She did
                        not connect these ideas with Lewis; his words seemed to her now the mere
                        expression of all the things which her own instinct had revealed, and which
                        she had put behind her in her desire that Sacha should relieve her of the
                        intolerable debt to Hamlin. The creature described by this odious man was
                        the real Sacha; she was Madame Elaguine as she now clearly appeared to Miss
                        Brown. And yet how unjust! Lewis had wanted to torment her by making her
                        jealous of Madame Elaguine; he now wished to pay off Madame Elaguine for
                        having, in some manner, slighted his own vanity.</p>
                    <p>“I think you take a dreadful view of the matter,” she said; “you explain
                        Madame Elaguine, who is only half a Russian, by all the horrible Russians
                        you have ever met or imagined. I think there is a much simpler explanation.
                        Madame Elaguine has been very strangely brought up; she has lived with very
                        bad people; her husband was a<pb n="224" xml:id="VAB7109-221"/> horrible
                        wretch, we all know. She is excessively hysterical—her mother, Mr Hamlin’s
                        aunt, was so also—and we all know that the desire to be prominent, to
                        deceive, is a common form of hysteria. And as she has never been brought up
                        to restrain herself, she imagines herself to be persecuted, and makes up the
                        persecution. She is much more to be pitied than to be blamed.”</p>
                    <p>Anne spoke rapidly. She seemed to be speaking fairly; and yet she knew she
                        was wilfully misrepresenting, that Madame Elaguine was something more than a
                        hysterical monomaniac: she remembered Mrs Macgregor’s stories of Sacha’s
                        degraded childhood, all the accusations of her precocious lying and
                        unchasteness, of her having led one of her cousins into mischief, and set
                        the house by the ears. She was indignant with herself for defending this
                        woman—out of charity? out of conviction? No. But merely because she required
                        that this woman be sufficiently innocent to become Hamlin’s wife.</p>
                    <pb n="225" xml:id="VAB7109-222"/>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis stroked his auburn beard meditatively.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t believe in praise and blame,” he answered; “I believe merely in
                        fate. Some people are born noble, truthful, chaste—others just the reverse.
                        It is the fault of neither; and each, in its way, is equally interesting and
                        valuable to the artist or the psychologist. The curious thing about Madame
                        Elaguine is, that she apparently stands half‐way; she is, according to the
                        ideas of the world, half responsible and half irresponsible. We see in her a
                        hysterical woman, troubled by a morbid love of deceit; and at the same time
                        a woman to whom such deceit is or has been practically necessary. Madame
                        Elaguine continues for her amusement, and develops to the utmost, an
                        imaginary persecution, whose origin must be sought in some intrigue which it
                        was her interest to veil by a mystification,” Lewis drawled on in his
                        omniscient, half‐pedantic way, as if the intrigues of married women were the
                        most usual subject of<pb n="226" xml:id="VAB7109-223"/> conversation between
                        a man and a young lady, and as if to suggest that Madame Elaguine had led a
                        loose life were the most obvious and inoffensive of proceedings.</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown blushed crimson; but she felt something more than insulted,
                        something more than indignant. What right had this man to focus all her own
                        suspicions concerning a woman whom she fervently wished not to suspect?</p>
                    <p>“Mr Lewis,” she said, “I don’t think those things should be listened to by me
                        or said by you. I believe that Madame Elaguine is not sound in her mind, and
                        that her persecution is a hoax; but I believe that she is an honest woman in
                        other respects. She is a friend of mine, and I will not hear her
                        slandered.”</p>
                    <p>“Heaven forbid that I should wish to slander her! I think she is a
                        fascinating woman; and she is—at least she was—quite as great a friend of
                        mine as of yours. I was only telling you how I explain her character.”</p>
                    <p>Lewis had always appeared a reptile in<pb n="227" xml:id="VAB7109-224"/>
                        Anne’s eyes; but never so much as just now.</p>
                    <p>“I hate scandal,” he said, taking his hat, “and I am most grieved to have
                        appeared to be talking scandal. People always misunderstand the sort of
                        passionate interest I take in every kind of curious character. I suppose you
                        would call it morbid, Miss Brown; but I really was considering Madame
                        Elaguine merely as an interesting study.”</p>
                    <p>All this kind of talk, of which Hamlin was so fond, perfectly sickened Anne;
                        and the sudden stirring up of all her old suspicions was exasperating.</p>
                    <p>“That is all very fine,” she said angrily; “but do you, or do you not,
                        believe Madame Elaguine to be a dishonourable woman, apart from this
                        monomania?”</p>
                    <p>“It is very hard to say. You know I disbelieve in what you call moral
                        responsibilities. I imagine Madame Elaguine to have found her mania for
                        persecution very convenient at one period of her life—yes, certainly<pb n="228" xml:id="VAB7109-225"/>. I think it is the only rational way to account for the beginning
                        of it—don’t you?”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown took no notice of Lewis’s insolent inquisitiveness of manner.</p>
                    <p>“If you think that, Mr Lewis,” she said, “may I ask how you reconciled with
                        your notions of gentlemanly behaviour the calm way in which you let Mr
                        Hamlin introduce such a woman as you describe to me, and let me continue to
                        know her? No; you are perfectly aware that all this is merely trumped up at
                        the moment.” And she put her hand on the bell‐handle, for the door to be
                        opened to Lewis.</p>
                    <p>Edmund Lewis smiled.</p>
                    <p>“Walter Hamlin’s eyes are quite as good as mine. As regards my behaviour
                        towards you, I cannot go into details, but you may understand, dear Miss
                        Brown, that two or three months ago I may not, as a man of honour, have been
                        at liberty to discuss Madame Elaguine’s character in the way that I<pb n="229" xml:id="VAB7109-226"/> have done now that Madame Elaguine’s
                        relations with me have entirely changed their nature. Good‐bye, dear Miss
                        Brown. I am most truly grieved if I have offended you in any way.”</p>
                    <p>Anne merely made an impatient gesture, a gesture almost of disgust, as Edmund
                        Lewis left the room.</p>
                    <p>So this was the explanation of Edmund Lewis’s apparent disgrace! Sacha
                        Elaguine had repelled his odious advances, she had closed her door to him,
                        she had complained to Hamlin; and now, as soon as their backs were turned,
                        Lewis had come to slander them without fear of a horsewhipping. Anne seemed
                        to breathe once more—thank heaven that the wretch had overreached himself in
                        his malice!</p>

                    <p><hi>THE</hi> door had scarcely closed upon Edmund Lewis, when it opened again
                        suddenly.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Perry!” cried Anne, rising and running forward as a child might run to
                        meet a former kind and encouraging teacher; “Mr Perry! oh I am so glad to
                        see you!”</p>
                    <p>It really seemed to her that this dear, good, open familiar face, with the
                        untidy yellow hair and beard,—that this well‐known, boyish, slouching figure
                        drove away like some cabalistic sign the loathsome creature who had been
                        there a few minutes before,—that Melton Perry dispelled all the horrid
                        vision left behind by Edmund Lewis.</p>
                    <p>“Didn’t expect me yet, eh, Annie—I mean Miss Brown?” said Melton Perry, as
                            she<pb n="231" xml:id="VAB7109-228"/> seized his hand in both hers. “I
                        suppose you expected me by the Dover train. But I came by Dieppe, six hours’
                        agony, but a saving of twelve‐and‐sixpence. I was always an economical
                        creature, wasn’t I? Why, what’s that you have round your neck? That beastly
                        little pewter and horn rosary that I got you at the Fair of the Impruneta,
                        by George! Fancy your having kept such a thing!”</p>
                    <p>“It’s one of the best things I have,” said Anne, the tears coming into her
                        eyes as this well‐known voice brought back the far‐distant past—“it’s the
                        present of a friend.”</p>
                    <p>“And all this, isn’t this also the present of a friend?” said Perry, throwing
                        himself into an arm‐chair, and looking round the room with much the same
                        wonder with which Anne had looked at its strange furniture, its brocades and
                        embroideries, and Japanese vases and lustre plates, when she first came;
                        “but I forgot, Walter Hamlin isn’t a particular friend of yours.”</p>
                    <p>To this jest Miss Brown made no answer:<pb n="232" xml:id="VAB7109-229"/> if
                        only Melton Perry could guess at the literal truth of his words!</p>
                    <p>“Lord, what a damned gorgeous place this is!” cried Perry, still looking
                        round; and then, suddenly turning towards Anne, where she sat, in a
                        wonderful trailing dress of deep crimson stamped velvet, a big bunch of
                        blackish crimson roses marking off, throwing into relief, the strange opaque
                        ivory of her face, “what a beautiful woman you are, Annie! Do you know, I
                        usen’t to believe it, when Watty raved about you at the Villa Arnolfini.
                        What a crusty old jackass I must have been! But tell, why in the wide world
                        aren’t you married yet? What have you been doing all this time?”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin has not asked me to marry him yet,” answered Anne,
                        laconically.</p>
                    <p>Melton Perry thrust his hands upon the arms of his chair, and his whole body
                        forward. “Not asked you to marry him yet!” he repeated; “do you mean to say
                        you aren’t engaged to him . . .?”</p>
                    <p>Anne shook her head.</p>
                    <pb n="233" xml:id="VAB7109-230"/>
                    <p>“That he’s been going loafing, and spooning, and doing <bibl><title>Vita
                            Nuova</title></bibl> all this time? I thought that he must have lost two dozen
                        grandfathers and grandmothers in rapid succession, so that one mourning
                        postponed your marriage after the other, or something similar.” Then a
                        thought suddenly struck him. “Hamlin’s not ill?” he cried. “Consumption,
                        madness, doctors’ consultations,—anything of that sort?”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown could not help smiling.</p>
                    <p>“Oh no, Mr Hamlin has been quite well. He is in Paris at present; he didn’t
                        expect you quite so soon, but he will be back in a day or two.”</p>
                    <p>Melton Perry rose and looked Anne very earnestly in the face—</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown—no, I can’t call you Miss Brown—Annie, tell me the truth. Has
                        Hamlin not kept his word—has he played you any dirty trick? No, no, I don’t
                        mean anything,—but, has Hamlin played fast and loose with you?”</p>
                    <pb n="234" xml:id="VAB7109-231"/>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin never intended asking me to marry him at once,” answered Anne,
                        evasively. She felt in Melton Perry’s suspicions that again, as with her
                        cousin, Hamlin would be attacked, maligned, that she would have to defend
                        him. “Don’t you remember, Mr Perry? We were to wait, to see whether we
                        really . . . I will tell you all about it later—to‐morrow. It is a long
                        story; I want to hear about you now, about Italy—about your work, the
                        children, Mrs Perry.”</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin,” she added, fearing lest her evasive answers, her haste to get
                        rid of the subject, should prejudice Perry against his friend, “has been
                        most generous and noble towards me; indeed much more than I can ever
                        say.”</p>
                    <p>“I’m damned if I understand any of it,” said Perry to himself, as he
                        proceeded to answer Anne’s rapid strings of questions about his wife, his
                        little girls, his pictures, his etchings,—those etchings, never thought of
                        before, which had revealed in this sixth‐rate painter<pb n="235" xml:id="VAB7109-232"/> a great artist, and had brought him, in good case
                        to make money, to England. Miss Brown insisted upon showing him up to his
                        room herself. As she was leaving him, he looked at her long and
                        seriously.</p>
                    <p>“Annie,” he said, “if it’s not rude to ask, for I’ve forgotten—how old are
                        you?”</p>
                    <p>“I was twenty‐four last month. Why do you ask? Do you think I look more?”—she
                        added, with a smile whose bitterness he did not catch. She could scarcely
                        realise it herself; she seemed to have lived so long, such years and years
                        since she had seen him last—nay, since she had first entered this room.</p>
                    <p>“Twenty‐four,” repeated Perry, stupidly. “Well now, don’t be offended—of
                        course you couldn’t be more, for you weren’t of age when you left us; but
                        somehow—it isn’t that you don’t look young, you know, but all the same I
                        should have thought . . . I’m a rude brute.”</p>
                    <p>“That I was much older,” laughed Miss Brown. “Well, I often think so
                        myself.”</p>
                    <pb n="236" xml:id="VAB7109-233"/>
                    <p>“It’s something, I don’t know what. You are far handsomer than in Italy, and
                        you never did look much like a girl—you know what I mean; but now, upon my
                        word, I don’t know how to say it, I never saw an unmarried woman look like
                        you. You look as if you had seen and understood such a heap of things. I
                        feel quite a fool before you. Forgive me,” he said, “I’m always a blundering
                        tomfool. I had somehow thought of you as something like my own girls.
                        Winnie’s sixteen, you know, and such a strapping girl. But I feel as if you
                        might be my grandmother.”</p>
                    <p>Anne laughed. “I have always felt as if I were your grandmother. I was born
                        old. Good‐bye, Mr Perry. Remember that dinner is at seven; and put on a
                        dress‐coat if you want to win the heart of my aunt—I mean Mr Hamlin’s
                        aunt.”</p>
                    <p>Melton Perry whistled as he stooped to unbuckle his portmanteau.</p>
                    <p>“I’m damned if I understand anything of it all, and Annie least of any of
                        them,” he mused.</p>

                    <p>“<hi>AFTER</hi> all,” said Melton Perry to himself next morning, as he sat
                        under the big apple‐trees in the garden, smoking his pipe and looking at
                        Miss Brown stitching at a piece of embroidery and overwhelming him with
                        questions about Winnie, Mildred, Leila, the baby, Mrs Perry—nay, even about
                        all her former fellow‐servants in Italy, and the grocer round the corner,
                        and the milkman, and the man who came from the country every Monday to fetch
                        the linen,—“after all, it was a very bright idea of old Watty’s to fall in
                        love with our nursemaid and turn her into a wonderful æsthetic being in a
                        wonderful æsthetic house: it was very sensible of Mrs Perry to encourage him
                        in the idea; and it was just like<pb n="238" xml:id="VAB7109-235"/> a
                        confounded, fumbling, purblind old pig and ass like me to try and prevent
                        it.”</p>
                    <p>After lunch Anne took Melton Perry up into the drawing‐room, cool, and almost
                        Italian, with drawn blinds and a faint smell of flowers in the dusk, on one
                        of the most stifling London afternoons. Perry mechanically took out a
                        cigarette; but he hastily put it in again. It seemed to him profanation to
                        smoke in such a wonderful room, in the presence of such a wonderful
                        woman.</p>
                    <p>“Please smoke; you used always to smoke after lunch with Mrs Perry,” said
                        Anne.</p>
                    <p>“But—this isn’t Florence; and you—you aren’t Mrs Perry.”</p>
                    <p>Anne made an impatient gesture that he should take out his cigarettes again.
                        She had determined that she must speak to him before Hamlin came; that she
                        must try and get him to understand, to explain things to Hamlin. But how get
                        this good‐natured, kindly, childish, yet in a way chivalrous, harum‐scarum
                        creature to understand her story? She<pb n="239" xml:id="VAB7109-236"/> had
                        a great dread of the impossibility of making him understand that Hamlin had
                        never acted meanly towards her—that their estrangement was due to nothing
                        voluntary on Hamlin’s part, to nothing but the disappointing of her own
                        perhaps unwarranted ideals; of making him understand that Hamlin’s
                        connection with Madame Elaguine, instead of being a grievance in her eyes,
                        was the greatest happiness she could conceive. Perry was sure to burst out
                        against Hamlin, to refuse to listen to her explanations, to insist upon
                        fighting the battle of an injured woman.</p>
                    <p>Anne groaned at the thought, as she might have groaned at some immense stone
                        to roll uphill. It was always so difficult for her to understand others, so
                        intolerably more difficult to make herself understood. But she had
                        resolved.</p>
                    <p>“I must tell you all my history since last we saw each other,” she said; “you
                        will want to hear it, won’t you, Mr Perry?”</p>
                    <p>Perry, to whose brain all the unwonted<pb n="240" xml:id="VAB7109-237"/>
                        splendour of this house, all the fantasticalness of finding his former
                        nursemaid changed into a magnificently dressed goddess, had gone with a sort
                        of narcotic effect, answered in a stupefied way, “Oh dear, yes—of course—I’m
                        dying to hear it. I can’t at all realise that it is really you, Annie, or
                        really anybody and anything. Do you remember when we went into Lucca that
                        day for the feast of the Holy Face, and I left you with Winnie and Mildred
                        to go to the opera with Hamlin? D’you remember the plaster bust of
                        Castruccio at the top of the hotel stairs, with the old woman’s night‐cap
                        on? I don’t know why that bust haunted me so. What tiny trots Winnie and
                        Mildred were, with sashes down at their knees! and such confounded young
                        flirts, five feet seven, as they are now! I see you have Winnie’s
                        photograph. How comic those brats must have looked! . . . But won’t you tell
                        me all your marvellous and incredible circumstances?”</p>
                    <p>“I scarcely know where to begin; perhaps<pb n="241" xml:id="VAB7109-238"/> I
                        had better begin at the end. You wanted to know,” said Anne, making a great
                        effort to arrest Perry’s attention, “why Mr Hamlin and I weren’t married
                        yet, nor even engaged . . .”</p>
                    <p>“Oh yes; what the deuce is the meaning of it, Annie? You are certainly the
                        queerest people, you æsthetic folk. By Jove! you actually have a photograph
                        of yourself with the children. I had clean forgotten its existence; and now
                        I remember as if it were yesterday taking you to Alinari’s, and how beastly
                        naughty Winnie was! Oh, what a sulky blackamoor you do look, Annie! Good
                        gracious! you don’t mean to say you know <emph>her</emph>?” and Melton Perry
                        suddenly turned the album, at which he was looking, towards Anne. “Where in
                        the world did you pick up a photograph of Mrs Constantine Bulzo?”</p>
                    <p>“Mrs Constantine Bulzo ?” asked Anne, in amazement. “Whom do you mean? I
                        never heard of such a person. That photograph?—why, that’s a half‐Russian
                        cousin of Mr Hamlin's<pb n="242" xml:id="VAB7109-239"/>, Sacha Elaguine, who was a Miss Polozoff.”</p>
                    <p>“Hamlin’s cousin!” whistled Melton Perry,—“well, upon my word . . . yes, of
                        course, I had forgotten—of course, her name isn’t Mrs Constantine Bulzo any
                        longer. But may I ask, how under heaven do you come to know Madame
                        Elaguine?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t understand a word. This lady is Madame Elaguine; she is Mr Hamlin’s
                        first cousin, and that’s of course how I come to know her.”</p>
                    <p>“Hamlin’s cousin or not Hamlin’s cousin, how in the wide world could a woman
                        like you ever know, ever meet such a—such a—excuse the word, but it’s the
                        least bad I can find—such an abominable baggage as this woman, Elaguine, or
                        Bulzo, or Polozoff—as this abominable Sacha?”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown turned white and almost green; the embroidery slipped out of her
                        hands—she gasped.</p>
                    <p>“Good Lord, what’s the matter with you,<pb n="243" xml:id="VAB7109-240"/>
                        Annie?” cried Perry, jumping up; “you surely didn’t imagine that—you surely
                        can’t be a great friend of such a creature as that. What’s the matter?—are
                        you ill?”</p>
                    <p>“It’s nothing—the heat, I suppose,” said Anne, stooping to pick up her
                        embroidery; “and then, also, I suppose I’m not very strong yet; I’ve had
                        brain fever, and you took me by surprise. But I oughtn’t to have been
                        surprised, because I know Sacha Elaguine has a great many enemies, and that
                        her circumstances, her history, and in some measure, unfortunately, her ways
                        and character, rather lend themselves to all manner of horrible stories.
                        She’s a frightfully tried and slandered little woman, poor thing. But I
                        don’t—I don’t believe any of it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne was conscious of a horrible effort as she spoke these words; lying was
                        difficult to her; and she remembered Edmund Lewis’s words.</p>
                    <p>“Are you really fond of Madame Bulzo—I mean Madame Elaguine?” asked Perry,
                            grown<pb n="244" xml:id="VAB7109-241"/> very serious suddenly, and
                        looking Anne in the face with an expression of surprise and pain. “Are you
                        intimate with her?”</p>
                    <p>“I am intimate in the sense of having been with her a good deal, and knowing
                        more than other people about her,” answered Anne; “but I can’t say I am a
                        great friend of hers. She is Mr Hamlin’s cousin; she has settled in England
                        recently; he—we, I mean—see a good deal of her. I am awfully sorry for her,
                        poor little woman; but there isn’t very much in common between us.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank goodness!” cried Perry. “Do you know, the sight of that photograph
                        made me feel quite sick—the thought that you, Annie, should be the friend of
                        such a creature. But I knew you couldn’t be.”</p>
                    <p>“But I am Madame Elaguine’s friend; I don’t believe a word of the infamous
                        stories that are told about her; and you wouldn’t believe them either, if
                        you knew all that I do.”</p>
                    <p>“What <emph>do</emph> you know ?” asked Perry, slowly<pb n="245" xml:id="VAB7109-242"/> and pityingly; “about the iniquities of Monsieur
                        Elaguine, about the terrible persecution, the bits of letters, the
                        pistol‐shots, the poisoned chocolate, the lit spirits of wine poured under
                        the door,—all that crazy imposture, I suppose? Well, I hope that Hamlin
                        knows no more than you; otherwise, by God! he’s no better than a blackguard
                        to let you associate with this woman, be she his cousin a hundred times
                        over; and you must never see that woman again, Annie. I forbid you to—I, as
                        the oldest friend you have in the world—I forbid you to defile yourself by
                        knowing that infamous creature.” And Perry walked fiercely up and down,
                        while Miss Brown, her whole body, it seemed to her, melting away from her
                        soul, sat speechless looking at him.</p>
                    <p>“Listen to me, Anne,” he said, “and judge whether I am unfair. God knows I’m
                        not a Puritan, neither towards myself nor towards others. I’ve been a very
                        rowdy man; I’ve knowu a great many rowdy women—what you call regular bad
                        women—Russians, who are the<pb n="246" xml:id="VAB7109-243"/> worst of
                        all—by the dozen. I’m not a red‐tapist; I can quite understand women
                        misbehaving,—having lovers—that sort of thing,—or even, if they are very
                        wretched, selling themselves. It’s beastly immoral to say so before a woman,
                        but still, there it is, it’s the truth. Well, such as you see me, I wouldn’t
                        touch <emph>that</emph> woman with the longest pair of tongs in all the
                        devil’s kitchen. That woman is really wicked—not merely immoral, but
                        abominable, atrocious; she is the sort of woman who absolutely degrades a
                        man, takes a pleasure in turning him into a beast and a madman—whose
                        greatest pleasure would be to degrade and make a beast of an honest woman.
                        Just listen to me. Some five years ago I knew a Greek couple—a young man and
                        his sister, called Constantine and Marie Bulzo. They were orphans, very
                        young, very handsome, especially the boy, who was only eighteen or nineteen.
                        They were a sort of half‐English Greeks, and went in for being æsthetical
                        and artistic, all that sort of thing. I knew them in Florence, where Miss
                            Bulzo,<pb n="247" xml:id="VAB7109-244"/> who was four or five years
                        older than her brother, was studying painting. I gave them both lessons. I
                        never met two such beautiful creatures, body and soul, as those young
                        Bulzos. They were like young saints, and yet perfectly childish and merry,
                        and they were quite devoted to each other: Marie really lived only for the
                        boy. Well, six months later I met the two at Venice. They were staying at
                        the same hotel as your Madame Elaguine, who immediately proceeded to make
                        herself awfully fascinating and pathetic to them. Of course the poor
                        children swallowed all about the persecutions by the Nihilists as so much
                        Gospel. They introduced me, and Madame Elaguine rather amused me; but I saw
                        very soon that she wasn’t a woman for them to know. There was a man staying
                        in the same hotel, an old friend of hers, and, in fact, her lover, who was
                        one of the vilest scoundrels the world ever bred—a horrible loathsome old
                        Russian. I used to wonder how Madame Elaguine could endure him, but then I
                        found out that he paid<pb n="248" xml:id="VAB7109-245"/> her bills for her.
                        I tried to warn the Bulzos, especially Constantine, as, being a man, he
                        might be expected to understand such things rather better. But, <foreign xml:lang="ita">figurati!</foreign> (and Perry made an expressive gesture
                        of Italian exaggeration,) they wouldn’t hear a word against their beloved,
                        deeply injured, martyrised Madame Elaguine. Well, we half quarrelled; I
                        scarcely saw anything of them. At the end of four months what do I hear, but
                        that Miss Bulzo was married to Madame Elaguine’s loathsome Russian; and
                        then, a week later, I see Constantine and Madame Elaguine go off in the
                        train together. Do you understand? Madame Elaguine, who was in love with
                        young Bulzo, wanted to go off with him, and not knowing what to do with
                        Marie, and wishing to dismiss and settle accounts with her <foreign xml:lang="lat">quondam</foreign> lover, had, in some fiendish way,
                        induced this innocent girl of twenty‐four to marry this frightful old
                        Russian sinner—had sold her to the loathsome beast as a settlement to their
                        debts; and Marie, after a few months, simply pined<pb n="249" xml:id="VAB7109-246"/> away and died of shame and disgust at the slavery
                        she had been sold into. Do you understand that?”</p>
                    <p>“I understand; but I don’t see why I should believe—it’s too horrible to be
                        true.”</p>
                    <p>“It is true, though, for Constantine Bulzo told it me all himself later; how
                        the Elaguine had talked him over to consent, and had regularly bullied his
                        sister into the marriage, by pretending that it was the only way of paying a
                        lot of imaginary debts of her brother’s, and had forced Constantine, who was
                        raving in love with her, to hold his tongue. That was the end of Marie
                        Bulzo. Now as to Constantine. His sister once safely married to her old
                        beast, he went off with the Elaguine, or rather, the Elaguine went off with
                        him. Next summer I met them at Perugia; they were travelling about in remote
                        places as Mr and Mrs Bulzo; and English people were so kind as to believe
                        that this Russian woman of thirty and this Greek boy of twenty were married.
                        Constantine perfectly adored her; but I never<pb n="250" xml:id="VAB7109-247"/> saw a man more changed: he looked thirty, a
                        miserable, hang‐dog, effeminate sort of creature, quite unable to do
                        anything except drag after his so‐called wife. That woman had regularly
                        ruined the poor boy, broken his spirit, turned him into a kind of male
                        odalisque of hers. Two years later the Bulzos were at Venice again; and I
                        came just in time for the catastrophe. One fine morning Mrs Constantine
                        Bulzo, become Madame Elaguine once more, packed her trunks and went off with
                        a French painter, leaving her supposed husband to pay the hotel bill.”</p>
                    <p>“I saw Constantine shortly after; the woman had spent nearly all his money,
                        and he was living, or starving, in a room in a beastly court, slinking out
                        only early in the morning and late at night, spending the day lying in his
                        bed, eating opium and drinking. I never saw such a wreck in my life. As he
                        was starving, I got him a place as clerk at a picture‐shop, and tried to get
                        him to work; but he didn’t seem to care about living, and went on drinking
                            and<pb n="251" xml:id="VAB7109-248"/> stupefying himself, till one day
                        he drowned himself in the lagoon—they say accidentally, but I shall never
                        believe it. That is the story of your Madame Elaguine; and I swear to you I
                        have not exaggerated one word of it. Do you still think she is a woman fit
                        to be known by you? By heaven! when I think what that miserable boy was when
                        I saw him last, and what he had been when first I knew him, I feel as if it
                        would be the greatest possible pleasure to throttle your Madame Elaguine
                        with my own hands! Upon my soul, I do!”</p>
                    <p>Perry was walking up and down rapidly. Anne had never seen him so excited in
                        his life.</p>
                    <p>“But,” remarked Miss Brown, coldly, “even admitting your story to be true,
                        which I suppose, as it comes from you, that I must, was it all the woman’s
                        fault? You men always throw the blame on the woman. But your Constantine
                        Bulzo must have been a wretched weak creature.”</p>
                    <p>Perry stopped short.</p>
                    <pb n="252" xml:id="VAB7109-249"/>
                    <p>“No one has a right to expect every man or every woman to be very strong,” he
                        answered, sadly. “This poor boy was kind and trusting, and, when left to his
                        own devices, honest. He was not weaker than most men, especially than most
                        artistic natures—not weaker, for instance, than Walter Hamlin.”</p>
                    <p>Anne Brown did not answer. But next morning she greatly surprised Melton
                        Perry by asking him, in a voice that affected him as being very strange—</p>
                    <p>“Did you tell me something—a dreadful story—about Madame Elaguine and a young
                        Greek friend of yours, yesterday afternoon?”</p>
                    <p>Perry looked at her with surprise. There was something in her wide‐opened,
                        strained eyes, in her rigidity of features, that made him think of a
                        sleep‐walker.</p>
                    <p>“Of course I did. Why?”</p>
                    <p>“Oh, nothing. I had only a very bad night—all manner of horrible dreams, and
                        I was not sure whether this might not be one of them.”</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
                    <p>“<hi>DO</hi> you know, Annie,” said Melton Perry, two or three days later, “I
                        find Watty very much altered. He seems so fearfully depressed and
                        broken‐spirited. He used always to be bored, but not like this; he has got
                        to look so old, with those great rings under his eyes.”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown did not answer. Hamlin had returned the previous evening from
                        Paris, and she also had noticed that he was changed—not so much, indeed, as
                        Melton Perry seemed to think, for Melton Perry had not seen him for four or
                        five years; and she—she had watched a change coming over him during the last
                        months. Yet even she must own to herself that this change had made rapid
                        progress during his fortnight or three weeks in Paris, or at least that this
                            absence<pb n="254" xml:id="VAB7109-251"/> enabled her to notice the
                        change much more. He was even more than usually apathetic and silent, and
                        his pleasure at seeing his old friend once more was so slight, or rather so
                        tempered by a kind of indifference and even annoyance, that Miss Brown felt
                        perfectly nervous lest poor warm‐hearted Melton Perry should feel mortally
                        wounded. The next day Hamlin made an effort over himself: he seemed anxious
                        to be as kind as possible to Perry; but somehow it did not succeed. Melton
                        Perry would have liked, as he said, to have Walter all to himself, to sit
                        with him by the hour together, or walk out alone with him, talking of old
                        times; but Hamlin seemed possessed by a nervous dread of a <foreign xml:lang="fre">tête‐à‐tête</foreign>. He could not sit in the studio
                        with Perry for more than half an hour without, on some excuse or other,
                        calling his aunt or Miss Brown. He seemed to have invited a lot of people to
                        drop in at all hours, as if to protect him from his old friend.</p>
                    <p>“It’s awfully good of old Hamlin to wish me to know all these grand swell
                        painters and<pb n="255" xml:id="VAB7109-252"/> newspaper writers,” said
                        Perry to Anne, in the tone of a disappointed child; “and I suppose it
                            <emph>is</emph> very useful to me. But still, I wish I could get him to
                        understand that what I want at present is to see just him and you; that all
                        these confounded influential people will keep; and that I’d rather have a
                        good talk over a pipe with him alone, as in old days.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer. It seemed to her that she understood so well why Hamlin
                        dreaded a <foreign xml:lang="fre">tête‐à‐tête</foreign> with Melton Perry; a
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">tête‐à‐t;ête</foreign> which would be, largely,
                        a talk about the past and the future, about her, Anne Brown. But Anne could
                        not think about poor Perry and his disappointed friendliness; her whole
                        nature seemed to be staggering and reeling, and the concerns of other folk
                        were as distant, as unattainable, as they might be to a person tossed for
                        hours on a stormy sea, paralysed, removed as it were from the world by an
                        unspeakable sense of nausea. The days seemed to reel past, and yet not a
                        week was gone since the arrival of Melton Perry.</p>
                    <p>One afternoon, they were seated—Hamlin,<pb n="256" xml:id="VAB7109-253"/>
                        Perry, and she—with Mrs Macgregor at tea in the dim, shuttered drawing‐room,
                        with the heavy scent of flowers, when Richard Brown was announced. If a
                        ghost had appeared on the threshold, Anne could not have turned paler, and
                        trembled harder in all her limbs—this man, whom she had seen but a week ago,
                        seemed indeed a spectre out of the past, the long dead past, with which all
                        connection was severed. It was an immense relief to her not to be alone; she
                        had an instinct that Richard had come to ask her whether, at last, she had
                        settled matters with Hamlin; she thought she could see his eyes going from
                        Hamlin’s face to her own inquiringly. The conversation was languid and
                        indifferent. Richard Brown wished for an explanation from her; Melton Perry
                        hoped for an explanation from Richard Brown; Hamlin looked on passively,
                        with that half‐stupefied look which she had noticed in him lately.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin was more than merely depressed, he was very sad; his face, so handsome
                        and still so young, so perfectly unmarked in feature,<pb n="257" xml:id="VAB7109-254"/> contrasted strikingly with the pleased,
                        happy‐go‐lucky, kindly face of Perry; with the strong, eager, contemptuous
                        face of Brown. For a moment Anne wondered what this sadness meant; whether
                        there was in him any recollection of what he was, of what he might be;
                        whether the poet, the dreamer, the chivalrous Hamlin of former days, still
                        existed and suffered within this weak and degraded Hamlin of the present;
                        and then, suddenly, this thought came in violent contact with the
                        remembrance of Perry’s story of Constantine Bulzo. Had Constantine Bulzo
                        looked like that?</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown, obviously disappointed in his visit, rose.</p>
                    <p>“Why are you going so soon, Brown ?” asked Hamlin, rising and making an
                        effort over himself; “you never give me a chance of seeing you. Won’t you
                        stay to dinner? It is very impertinent of me to invite people in a house
                        that isn’t mine; but I feel sure Miss Brown is disappointed in not having
                        had any talk with you. Chough is coming to see Perry<pb n="258" xml:id="VAB7109-255"/> this evening, so you and your cousin might have a
                        chat after dinner.”</p>
                    <p>He spoke simply, in his quiet, subdued, melancholy voice. Richard Brown
                        looked at him rapidly from head to foot; what was the meaning of this? And
                        Anne felt herself growing very red. Had Hamlin guessed what she scarcely
                        herself knew?</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” answered Richard; “I am dining with some of my would‐be
                        constituents to‐night. You know,” he said to Anne, “I am going into
                        Parliament, I believe. I will return soon; many thanks, Mr Hamlin.”</p>
                    <p>“I have a good many things to tell you, Nan,” he said, as Miss Brown
                        accompanied him to the room‐door. “I have heard of a scholarship which I am
                        sure you could take if you would cram for six months; and I want to ask you
                        a lot of things also. I will come back in two or three days. Good‐bye.”</p>
                    <p>He squeezed her hand; and Anne felt her heart thump at that hand‐squeeze, so
                        frank and affectionate.</p>
                    <pb n="259" xml:id="VAB7109-256"/>
                    <p>“Good‐bye, Cousin Dick,” she said. Her voice and eyes and hand lingered in
                        that farewell, in a way quite unusual to her reserved and decided nature.
                        She was saying goodbye she knew not exactly to what, but she felt that the
                        farewell was the last, and that it meant farewell to her happiness.</p>
                    <p>Chough came to dinner and stayed during the evening.</p>
                    <p>When he and Hamlin had taken their departure, Perry remained for a few
                        moments standing by the open window, looking vacantly at the trees, the
                        outlines of the craft moored opposite, the long trails of moonlight on the
                        water. Then he came back into the room, and began fiddling with some roses
                        in a glass.</p>
                    <p>“Beautiful roses,” he said, in an awkward drawl; “we have none like them in
                        Italy. Why don’t Italians cultivate flowers? What do you call this? Is it a
                        La France? I never knew a turnip from a jasmine.”</p>
                    <p>“I think it is a La France; I don’t know,” answered Anne, taking a
                        candlestick off the<pb n="260" xml:id="VAB7109-257"/> dining‐room
                        mantelpiece. “I think I must leave you now. You will find a box of
                        cigarettes on the sideboard. Forgive me, I feel so tired and stupid.”</p>
                    <p>“One moment!” cried Perry. “It’s a very disagreeable thing I have to say,
                        Annie; but I think I ought to say it. I guessed it the second time I saw him
                        already; but now I am quite sure of it—Hamlin drinks.”</p>
                    <p>Anne did not answer.</p>
                    <p>“I don’t mean to say that he gets drunk. But he drinks—spirits; I’ve seen him
                        to‐night after dinner, and I’m sure he’s going to take more at home. There’s
                        no mistaking the look. It isn’t that he takes much, not more than I or most
                        men might take; but it is that he oughtn’t to take any. He used, you know,
                        never even to take wine, except with gallons of water. He can’t take
                        anything of the sort. I remember already when we were at college together,
                        Watty was a teetotaller. It appears some people are like that; I’ve heard
                        doctors say that it’s not unusual in families where<pb n="261" xml:id="VAB7109-258"/> there has been much drinking: it’s a sort of
                        diseased sensitiveness to alcohol—it becomes a kind of poison. You know that
                        Hamlin’s father drank, and one of his uncles died of drink, and his brother
                        is either dead or dying, somewhere in a <foreign xml:lang="fre">maison de
                            santé</foreign>, of a sort of mixed <foreign xml:lang="lat">delirium
                            tremens</foreign> and craziness. It’s a thing,” went on Perry, keeping
                        his eyes fixed on the pattern of the Persian rug under his feet, “which
                        grieves and alarms me horribly; and in which I feel that you are probably
                        the only person who could have any influence with him. It’s useless my
                        speaking. He must have got in among a bad lot. That little Chough seems
                        harmless enough;but I hear that he was very close with a nasty fellow called
                        Lewis—a spiritualist, opium‐eater, haschisch‐eater, and heaven knows what.
                        Does he see much of him now?”</p>
                    <p>“He has quarrelled with Edmund Lewis, I fancy.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah—so much the better. Then this would evidently be the moment to act. Of
                            course<pb n="262" xml:id="VAB7109-259"/> I know it will be awfully
                        difficult and horrible for you; because he’ll feel so miserably ashamed
                        before you, and, of course, you will feel it almost as badly as he. But
                        still, you are the only person that can influence him. You see he loves you,
                        worships you, all that sort of thing. And I am sure you will have the
                        courage to get over your repugnance to a disagreeable half‐hour, won’t you,
                        Annie, for your own sake as well as his?”</p>
                    <p>“I will do my best,” said Miss Brown.</p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
                    <p><hi>MISS BROWN</hi> went up to her room slowly, and slowly proceeded to
                        undress.</p>
                    <p>“You look very tired, miss,” said her maid; “haven’t you perhaps been
                        overtiring yourself so soon after your illness? and don’t you think you had
                        better let me brush your hair for you?”</p>
                    <p>Anne shook her head; she had never consented to let any one wait upon her
                        except when ill, with that odd feeling that she, a servant, had no right to
                        have a servant; and the maid whom Hamlin considered as a sort of necessary
                        institution for a woman in Miss Brown’s position, had been virtually put at
                        the disposal of Mrs Macgregor, whose constant fidgeting over her clothes,
                        and tea, and coffee,<pb n="264" xml:id="VAB7109-261"/> and food, according
                        to hygienic theories of thirty years back, might have afforded occupation
                        not to two but to twenty maids. Anne really did look very worn out; more so
                        than she had seemed these several weeks, thought the maid.</p>
                    <p>“No, thank you, Laura,” said Miss Brown. She really did not feel at all as if
                        she could sleep; she felt the blood rushing through every artery of her
                        body, and a hot faintness overtake her.</p>
                    <p>“It won’t do to make myself ill again,” she said to herself. The doctor had
                        said that for the present she must try and get as much sleep as possible;
                        and she was a practical, methodical person. She brushed her hair, still in
                        short wavy masses since it was cut during the fever, carefully, slowly. It
                        seemed to her as if, in the half light, it looked more grey than black. She
                        pulled out a few white hairs: they come early in hair as dark and wiry as
                        hers. She folded her clothes methodically, as she used to fold the clothes
                            of<pb n="265" xml:id="VAB7109-262"/> the little Perrys, put out her
                        light and lay down.</p>
                    <p>“It won’t do to make myself ill again,” she said; and, closing her eyes,
                        determined to sleep.</p>
                    <p>She remained stretched out rigidly, like a dead woman, her head straight on
                        her pillows, and trying to keep her mind as rigid as her body. But it was of
                        no use. She could not sleep; her blood and her thoughts seemed to throb
                        furiously within her.</p>
                    <p>Anne’s mind had been made up, quietly, methodically, much in the same way as
                        her hair had been brushed and her clothes folded, already a good hour ago,
                        when talking to Melton Perry; she had seen the necessity of a decision
                        coming, had waited for the moment when the decision should be made, ever
                        since she had heard that story of Madame Elaguine and Constantine Bulzo.
                        There had been, it seemed to her, no alternative; and there seemed to her
                        that there was no alternative now, either. But as she lay motionless in<pb n="266" xml:id="VAB7109-263"/> her bed, and stared into the darkness
                        with wide‐opened eyes, she began, once more, to go over slowly and
                        repeatedly the steps of the argument, which had, three or four days ago,
                        become manifest to her as might the mechanism of a broken watch to a
                        watchmaker, of any very inevitable and obvious thing.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin had done everything for her; he had turned what she looked back upon
                        with horror, as a kind of intellectual and moral death, into life. He had
                        bought her soul free, had nourished and nurtured it, as a man might have
                        redeemed, nourished, and nurtured the body of some slave child, doomed to be
                        a cripple in a crippling occupation; he had done, she felt assured, what no
                        other man had ever done for a woman, since no other woman, she thought,
                        could have escaped from such a state of utter soul stagnation as had already
                        begun, those five years ago, in her slow, sullen nature. It was more than
                        had ever been done for another woman, and Anne felt its value<pb n="267" xml:id="VAB7109-264"/> more than any other; for despite the modesty and
                        frankness which often took others aback, the very stuff of her soul, like
                        the very mould of her features, was pride. She knew herself to be nobler
                        than the majority of men and women; not more intelligent, nor more honest,
                        nor more kindly, nor any one particular quality, but more homogeneous of
                        nature; not alloyed in any portion, whatever she might be; upright, sincere,
                        practical, harsh even, through and through: a reality, where they seemed but
                        half reality and half make‐up. And that she should be this she owed to
                        Hamlin; without him she would have been equally homogeneous of soul, but it
                        would have been with the uniformity, the rigidity of spiritual death.</p>
                    <p>What Hamlin had done, he had done from no base motives, and without the
                        smallest taint of baseness in the doing: he had not actually wanted her, he
                        had wanted merely to perfect a thing that seemed to him good of its sort, to
                        make her a soul that should suit<pb n="268" xml:id="VAB7109-265"/> her body;
                        he had done it deliberately, consistently, unwearyingly, with a gentleness,
                        a generous tact, which had themselves been a benefit.</p>
                    <p>That Hamlin had acted from an imaginative whim, that he had carried out an
                        exotic artistic caprice, played a sublimated game of artistic skill, Anne
                        could not at this moment take into account. She knew, and only too well,
                        that Hamlin was selfish, whimsical, fantastic, vain, a seeker after new
                            <foreign xml:lang="fre">poses</foreign> and new sensations; but she knew
                        all this analytically, piecemeal as the result of thought; and she was in a
                        sense too dull, too unable to comprehend others, and, above all, too utterly
                        devoid of all vanity, whimsicalness, and theatricality, too completely of a
                        piece, a mass of granite, as she often felt, to conceive these analytically
                        recognised peculiarities as absolutely organic and active forces. She had
                        conceived Hamlin to be that which to her was the easiest
                        conception—generous; and nothing could make her conceive his behaviour
                        towards her in any<pb n="269" xml:id="VAB7109-266"/> any other light.
                        Moreover, there remained in this frank and fearless nature, shrinking from
                        no disillusions, one delusion which was the safer for her very consciousness
                        of uncompromising hatred of all delusions. She clung, without knowing it, to
                        the belief that in one thing at least Hamlin had been perfectly noble, that
                        no subsequently discovered weakness and baseness could ever alter that; she
                        treasured up a shred of her old ideal, the belief that whatever Hamlin might
                        be towards others and towards himself, towards her he had been the real
                        Hamlin whom she had loved and worshipped.</p>
                    <p>And now this Hamlin, this man to whom she owed all, and whose past she still
                        loved, was gradually being alienated from all the nobler things for which he
                        was fit—gradually being separated from his nobler self, and dragged,
                        stripped of all his better qualities, into a moral quagmire, a charnel, a
                        cloaca, to stick and rot inchwise. And this, Anne said to herself, to some
                        degree by her own<pb n="270" xml:id="VAB7109-267"/> fault; for had she not
                        let her antipathy for the tendencies which she had gradually discovered in
                        him, and her loathing for the tendencies of the men who surrounded him,
                        smother her gratitude, her sympathy, turn her away in sullen scorn and
                        isolation, from the man whom she was bound to help, and the men whom she was
                        bound to combat? She forgot for the moment the many abortive attempts she
                        had made to awaken the better qualities of Hamlin; or rather, she could no
                        longer conceive that those attempts had been sufficiently strenuous and
                        determined; it seemed to her, forgetful of the dead‐weight of opposition,
                        that she must have been very feeble and half‐hearted. Instead of thinking of
                        him, she had thought only of herself, of preserving her own soul from
                        infection, of keeping her own soul strong and active; she had selfishly
                        thought of the world’s miseries, which she could not prevent, instead of
                        thinking of Hamlin, whom she might have saved; and finally, she had let
                        herself indulge in dreams of liberty, that is to say, of desertion<pb n="271" xml:id="VAB7109-268"/> of her duty. Those monks and nuns of former days, for whom she
                        felt such unutterable contempt, had they acted differently from her when
                        they left their fellow‐men to perish in sin, in order that they might enjoy
                        the luxury of virtue in a convent or a desert? She loathed æsthetes like
                        Hamlin; and yet, what had she herself been, save an æsthete of another sort,
                        selfishly preoccupied with spiritual comfort, and worse than any of them for
                        the very moral consciousness which lay at the root of this immorality?</p>
                    <p>Why had she not driven away Edmund Lewis, opposing herself to him with all
                        her might? Why had she not driven away Sacha Elaguine? Now that she had
                        learned from Melton Perry what this woman really was, every single
                        circumstance of their former intercourse, every single fact and suggestion
                        that had come to her, from Mrs Macgregor’s warnings to Edmund Lewis’s
                        cowardly accusation,—all the hundred little impressions which she herself
                        had received, grouped themselves<pb n="272" xml:id="VAB7109-269"/> together,
                        and made it obvious that Sacha must be, could only have been, the horrible
                        walking depravity which she had been revealed. Essentially unanalytic of
                        mind, Miss Brown could now no longer conceive how it was that she had not
                        understood Madame Elaguine at once; in that massive horror with which the
                        Russian woman had filled her, it was impossible to remember all the deluding
                        little circumstances which had closed her heart to suspicion—nay, all the
                        purity of her own nature, the charity, the desire to be equitable, which had
                        made this now so overpowering mass of abomination not merely impossible to
                        realise, but impossible to conceive. It seemed to her as if Sacha must
                        always have shown herself what she was; and that she, Anne Brown, must have
                        wilfully closed her eyes. She had never asked herself whether it was not her
                        duty towards Hamlin to come to some conclusion about his cousin; she had let
                        their connection drift on; she had seen in the ruin of the man to whom she
                        owed all, only a means to her<pb n="273" xml:id="VAB7109-270"/> own
                        deliverance from a life which she hated, from a duty which she shirked. Anne
                        remembered how she had watched with terror that look of weariness and shame
                        on Hamlin’s face, which ought to have told her that this poor, weak, sick
                        soul might still be saved; she remembered the joy with which she had heard
                        of Hamlin’s departure for Paris—that is to say, of the crowning act of
                        weakness and folly which had made him the chattel of his cousin. Anne
                        loathed herself as a woman might loathe herself, who recognised that she had
                        let some living creature die of hunger and want of nursing. Shame she did
                        not feel, nor yet remorse; she cared too little for herself to care for her
                        own ideals; she did not once think that she had been mistaken, that she had
                        been base, ungrateful, that she was dishonoured in her own eyes; she merely
                        thought that Hamlin was on the brink of ruin, ruin of all his nobler self
                        and of his happiness—that she had done it, and that she was there, alone, to
                        save him. In those long hours, lying motionless in the<pb n="274" xml:id="VAB7109-271"/> dark, the face of Hamlin, as she had recently
                        seen it, that weak, profoundly depressed, half‐degraded face, was constantly
                        before her eyes; and surrounding it, vague and threatening, the faces—so
                        strangely like it and transfigured in a kind of tragic degradation, of the
                        portraits at Wotton Hall—of Hamlin’s half‐crazy, disgraced brother; of his
                        odious, passion‐stained father; of his drunken uncles; above all, that
                        beautiful woman’s face, with the curled hair and loose collar—that face so
                        curiously compounded of effeminacy, whimsicalness, and cynical
                        self‐abandonment; of his great‐uncle Mordaunt, whose portrait had been
                        exiled to the lumber‐room, whose name banished from the memory of his
                        relatives; and along with them, and resembling them like a brother, the
                        confused, imaginary image of that miserable Greek lad whom Sacha Elaguine
                        had ruined.</p>
                    <p>Was it still time? Could Hamlin still be saved? was he already hopelessly
                        bound for life to Madame Elaguine? Had Anne waked<pb n="275" xml:id="VAB7109-272"/> up too late? She did not know. She only knew that
                        there was not an hour, not a moment to lose; and that there was but one
                        thing to be done. Hamlin must not, should not, marry Sacha. And the only way
                        to prevent it was that he should marry Anne Brown. He might, as Lewis said,
                        and as she believed, already be the lover of Madame Elaguine; but he was not
                        yet the husband, and most probably not yet the betrothed. And was he not
                        bound, by that paper which the ignoble suspiciousness of Richard Brown had
                        required of him in that distant past in Florence, to marry Anne Brown at
                        whatever time she rnight call upon him to do so?</p>
                    <p>“I must become his wife,” said Anne to herself; and she said it as she might
                        have said “the sun must rise in so many hours.” There was no room for
                        hesitation on her part; the choice, the act of volition, was so decided,
                        that there ceased to be either choice or volition; to become Hamlin’s wife
                        seemed to Anne as an inevitable necessity coming from<pb n="276" xml:id="VAB7109-273"/> without. But little by little: as she lay there
                        broad awake, yet with somewhat of that tendency, as of an opium‐dreamer, to
                        see things exaggerated which comes to us in darkness, she began to realise
                        the meaning of this formula—to become Hamlin’s wife. The whole past rushed
                        into her mind, and became, as it were, the mirage of the future, and that
                        mirage was horrible. To be Hamlin’s wife meant to relinquish the liberty
                        which had, for the last two or three months, been safe within her grasp, the
                        liberty of being herself. Anne was one of those natures which, though able,
                        by moments, to enjoy themselves like children, do not believe much in
                        happiness; to whom, singled out, as it were, to achieve self‐sacrifice or
                        endure martyrdom, happiness is a mere name, a negative thing—but to whom
                        unhappiness is a positive reality, the thing which they expect, with which
                        their soul seems, in some pre‐natal condition, to have become familiar as
                        the one great certainty. The happiness, therefore, which she was
                            losing—the<pb n="277" xml:id="VAB7109-274"/> independence, the activity,
                        the serenity, the possibility of a life of noble companionship with Richard
                        Brown—all this was only a distant and unsubstantial thing; she had never
                        experienced it, and it could not well be realised. But she knew by
                        experience, familiar with its every detail, the unhappiness which lay in the
                        future as Hamlin’s wife, for this future would be but a return to the past;
                        and she felt as might a person lost in a catacomb, and who, having got to a
                        chink, having seen the light and breathed the air, should be condemned to
                        wander again, to rethread for ever the black and choking corridors leading
                        nowhere. That Hamlin was lost if he married Sacha, she knew as she knew that
                        two and two make four; but she did not in the least flatter herself that her
                        own influence would be as potent for good, as Madame Elaguine’s must be
                        potent for evil. She knew Hamlin too well for that, and herself also. If
                        Hamlin had remained weak, cold, vain, and mean under her influence hitherto,
                        he must remain<pb n="278" xml:id="VAB7109-275"/> so for ever; he was born
                        all these things. She could prevent his growing worse, she could not make
                        him grow better; her position would be as that of a woman who devoted
                        herself to nurse a person sick of an incurable disease: there would be none
                        of the excitement of a possible cure, only the routine, the anxiety peculiar
                        to a case where the patient is for ever on the brink of getting worse.</p>
                    <p>To be understood, to be sympathised with, to be loved really and really to
                        love—none of these things would be for her. But, after all, what right had
                        she to any of them? Anne was, in all matters concerning herself, a born
                        fatalist and pessimist; the words of Goethe, “Entbehren sollst du, sollst
                        entbehren,” were to her not an admonition, but a mere statement of fact. She
                        had, for a time, fancied that she clutched happiness; if it had turned out,
                        like the goddess clutched by Ixion, a mere mist, why, that was quite
                        natural; there was nothing to complain of in that.</p>
                    <p>But suddenly there came a sense not any<pb n="279" xml:id="VAB7109-276"/>
                        longer of the loss of happiness, but of a sickened revolt from all the
                        things which this sacrifice of happiness implied. Not to love, not to be
                        loved. Well, that was natural; but to submit to becoming the property of a
                        man whom she did not love, and who could not, in her eyes, ever love her,
                        that was another thing. Edmund Lewis and Madame Elaguine, learned in such
                        matters, had been perfectly correct when they declared that Anne was, in
                        their sense of the word, passionless, cold. To this woman, consumed by
                        intellectual and moral passion, her womanhood meant merely the instincts of
                        superior chastity, of superior soul cleanness, which seem the birthright of
                        women, as the instincts of superior generosity, of superior soul energy,
                        seem the birthright of men; and this, to her the only result of womanhood,
                        merely added a positive element of repulsion to the disdain for what the
                        world is pleased to call love already existing in her. Anne Brown, born of
                        the people, grown up as a servant, left to take care of herself when<pb n="280" xml:id="VAB7109-277"/> scarcely more than a child, and then
                        thrust into the midst of a demoralised school of literature which gloried in
                        moral indifference,—Anne Brown had none of those misty notions of marriage
                        so easily transfigured into poetry, and which make (and perhaps fortunately)
                        many clean‐souled and disdainful girls enter unconsciously and unabashed
                        upon a life frequently neither very noble nor very clean. Without
                        formulating it to herself—for she never formulated anything—Miss Brown had a
                        very strong sense that marriage without love was a mere legalised form of
                        prostitution. To become, therefore, the wife of Hamlin, was an intolerable
                        self‐degradation—nay, a pollution; for it seemed to her, and the idea
                        sickened her whole soul, that the moral pollution of Sacha Elaguine would be
                        communicated to her. To become the wife of Sacha’s lover! Her limbs seemed
                        to give way, to dissolve; a horrible warm clamminess overtook her; she could
                        not breathe, or breathed only horror.</p>
                    <p>Anne rose from her bed, and wrapping herself<pb n="281" xml:id="VAB7109-278"/> in her dressing‐gown, sat down by the window, partly ajar. She
                        threw it wide open, pulled up the blinds, and, gasping, looked out into the
                        darkness. The sky was covered, not a ray of light; it was raining—she heard
                        the drops fall heavily on the leaves under the window; a warm damp gust of
                        air blew in her face. Anne did not know what it was to faint, and her limbs
                        did not give way beneath her; but she felt as if her mind, her soul, were
                        fainting, growing clammy—slipping, slipping away, dissolving into
                        nothingness. To be the wife of Sacha’s lover! With the scornful aversion
                        which a woman of actively chaste nature (for the virtue exists in most women
                        only in a negative, passive condition) experiences for the more abstract
                        idea of weakness and unchastity, was mingled—perhaps not very clearly to
                        herself—somewhat already of the wrath of the outraged wife. Under her very
                        eyes, before all the world, Hamlin had deceived her—had been another woman’s
                        lover—and had let her associate with his<pb n="282" xml:id="VAB7109-279"/>
                        mistress! the kind of resentment which the world sometimes mistakes for
                        jealousy, but into which there enters no love,—the sense not of being
                        neglected as an individual, but being insulted as a woman. To be the wife of
                        Sacha’s lover! Anne’s imagination—slow in all things, and slowest where any
                        ignoble or impure thing was concerned—was trailed as by an inexplicable
                        force along a dim tract of foulness.</p>
                    <p>No; she could not marry this man. She had no right to forego her just
                        resentment, to stifle her just disgust, no right to degrade her soul in
                        order to save his. If he was weak, vain, foredoomed to baseness, let him run
                        his career—fulfil his destiny. Some sacrifices are sins. Without identifying
                        the case, Anne’s thoughts reverted to the story, to the words of Isabella in
                        ‘Measure for Measure’; and the pride that lay at the bottom of her soul—the
                        pride of purity and strength—rose like a great wind within her. No; she
                        would not pollute her cleanness, prostitute her nobility, for this<pb n="283" xml:id="VAB7109-280"/> man. Anne folded her dressing‐gown close
                        about her, and extended her strong fingers tight over the arms of her
                        chair—a movement like that of a judge about to pronounce a sentence. Any one
                        who could have seen her sitting thus by the window—who could have seen that
                        pale stern face, those wide‐opened onyx‐grey eyes looking steadfastly into
                        the darkness—would have said that this magnificent young woman with the
                        tragic features was capable of cold cruelty.</p>
                    <p>But though in some measure right, since there is a destructive element in all
                        strong souls, the person who should have thought like this would yet have
                        been mistaken. Anne’s ruthlessness, her cruelty, could exist only against
                        herself; the sacrifice, which seemed to her no very great matter, was the
                        sacrifice of herself.</p>
                    <p>Anne remained seated for a few minutes by the window, that storm of pride and
                        contempt rushing in great gusts through her whole nature. But then suddenly
                        the storm dropped.</p>
                    <pb n="284" xml:id="VAB7109-281"/>
                    <p>Here was Hamlin, to whom she owed everything, owed this very soul which
                        seemed too good to be wasted upon him, in danger of being degraded for ever
                        by this loathsome woman, this incarnation of all his own vices, this moral
                        disease become a human creature. This fate <emph>must</emph> be averted,
                        Hamlin <emph>must</emph> be saved, for his own sake and for the sake of the
                        world—of all those nobler things that he might still do; he must be saved,
                        and only one thing could save him—hence that one thing must be done. Anne
                        rose from the window. This darkness unnerved her. She struck a light and lit
                        the candles on the mantelpiece; they were in clustered candlesticks, and the
                        room was brilliantly illuminated. Anne looked round her. There was a heap of
                        books and papers on her table,—she had been interrupted in tidying them the
                        previous day. She began to put them to rights. Some of the books were the
                        manuals of political economy and works on philosophy which she was studying
                        with a view to Girton.<pb n="285" xml:id="VAB7109-282"/> The sight of them
                        made a knot rise in her throat and the tears come into her eyes. She felt
                        that she would never read them again. She took them in her arms, and opening
                        the lowest drawer of her writing‐table, locked them up. “I will give them to
                        Marjory’s women’s club,” she thought. Then she opened another drawer, and
                        got out all her note‐books and copy‐books,—her many months’ work, ever since
                        Richard Brown had first lent her his primer. She turned over a few pages
                        slowly. The sentences seemed to have no meaning; her brain refused to act.
                        She took the papers one by one and tore them into small shreds, and threw
                        them into the waste‐paper basket. “There is an end of that,” she said to
                        herself quietly. Anne looked round the room once more,—at the spruce Queen
                        Anne furniture which had surprised her so much, at the blue and white vases,
                        the shimmering plates, the pieces of embroidery on the wall—all the things
                        which Hamlin had put there to please her. Was there anything more—anything
                        more to<pb n="286" xml:id="VAB7109-283"/> be done? On the mantelpiece stood
                        a photograph of Richard Brown, unframed, which he had recently given her:
                        she had asked him for a photograph during Hamlin’s absence with Sacha. She
                        took the photograph and held it over one of the candles; it curled up,
                        charred, only the rim which she held remaining to show what it had been; she
                        turned it round and round over the flame, and then threw the crumpled piece
                        of charred pasteboard into the grate.</p>
                    <p>The first pale light of dawn was beginning to mingle with the light of the
                        candles, making them burn yellow, and surrounded by a sort of halo, like the
                        tapers round a catafalque. Outside she saw the chilly grey streaks of light,
                        the faint cold rose veinings of sunrise. But the sunrise itself did not
                        come; the sky gradually appeared, clotted with red and purplish reflections;
                        then the colour died away, and there remained instead a pale, suffused, grey
                        heaven. It began to drizzle. Anne left the window. The room was light now
                            with<pb n="287" xml:id="VAB7109-284"/> daylight—the candle‐flames mere
                        yellow specks. Anne put them out; she pulled down the blinds and got into
                        bed, and again stretched herself out in that stiff way, her head propped up
                        on the pillows, trying not to think. In a few minutes she was asleep.</p>
                    <p>When the maid came in, she did not wake up as usual, and the girl was
                        half‐frightened and very much awed by seeing Miss Brown lying straight and
                        motionless; her face, surrounded by a sort of wreath of short, curling,
                        iron‐black locks, stiff on the pillow, looking, in the grey morning light
                        which came through the pale‐blue blinds, like a dead woman.</p>
                    <p>Anne opened her eyes and looked round slowly, as if trying to collect her
                        thoughts. “Ah,” she said, half audibly, “I remember.”</p>

                    <p><hi>BY</hi> an effort of manœuvring which was not very natural to her, Miss
                        Brown induced Melton Perry to take himself off after breakfast and go and
                        see some studios, an expedition which would keep him out of the way till
                        lunch. She would have Hamlin all to herself. When Perry was gone, Anne sat
                        down to write to Mary Leigh, who was in the country. There was absolutely no
                        reason why she should write to Mary, nor had she anything whatever to tell
                        her; but she was devoured by a restlessness—by a vague desire to talk to
                        some one who cared for her. She told Mary Leigh nothing of what was passing
                        through her mind, nor of the event which was pending: there was not, in her
                        letter, a word to suggest<pb n="289" xml:id="VAB7109-286"/> anything of the
                        sort; but there was in it the expression, vague and without motives, of the
                        great emotion which occupied her soul. “I want to tell you, dear Mary,”
                        wrote Anne, “how grateful I am for the affection which you and Marjory have
                        shown towards me lately. If I had died of that illness, it would have been a
                        great consolation to know that you cared for me so much.” She did not know
                        why, the tone of the whole letter, with all these expressions of gratitude,
                        had the solemnity of a farewell, as if written by a woman who expected to
                        die soon. And Anne really felt as if her life were coming to an end.</p>
                    <p>When she had finished writing, she went down to Hamlin’s studio. He would
                        come soon, and she would wait for him here.</p>
                    <p>It was still drizzling, and the room opening on to the garden, with its silk
                        blinds drawn down, was full of a kind of twilight. Anne walked up and down
                        for a minute or two, looking vaguely round her. A drowsy scent of faded
                        flowers, of cigarette‐smoke, of she<pb n="290" xml:id="VAB7109-287"/> knew
                        not what scent, made her feel weak and dreamy, and reminded her, with a
                        movement of disgust, of Sacha Elaguine’s rooms. She had not been in the
                        studio of late, except for a few minutes at a time. Everything seemed to her
                        untidy and dusty—easels and boards thrown about in a way which was not usual
                        with Hamlin. She looked vaguely at the various things,—at the drawings by
                        Rossetti and Burne Jones on the walls, the books in cases, the terra cottas
                        and bits of carving on brackets, the piano with the brocade cover thrown
                        back, and the score of Wagner’s Tristram still on the desk. She looked at
                        the score and played a few notes, but stopped. She loathed that music which
                        Hamlin and Sacha so admired—that music, with its strange, insidious
                        faintings and sobbings, its hot, enervating gusts of passion. On the
                        mantelpiece, among the Japanese jars, the bronze lamps, and other similar
                        properties, her eye caught a small bottle of blue glass. She took it up: it
                        was not labelled, or the label was removed, but it<pb n="291" xml:id="VAB7109-288"/> left a sort of sickly‐smelling stickiness on her
                        fingers. So Perry was right; Hamlin had returned to his old practice of
                        taking opium. She put the bottle back, and walked up and down once more.
                        Then her eye fell upon an unfinished portrait of herself, or what was
                        intended to be herself, which stood in the shadow. A solemn sombre woman in
                        green, with very blue peaks and glaciers in the distance, twisting the faded
                        green leaves of a palm‐branch. It was the picture which Hamlin had begun
                        long, long ago in Florence; and her mind went back to that other rainy day,
                        as gloomy as this one, seemingly centuries ago, when she had stood in the
                        tower studio, about to take leave of Hamlin, as she thought, for the last
                        time. Was she really as sombre as that picture? thought Anne. On a table,
                        gritty with dust, lay an open sketch‐book; Anne took it up listlessly. The
                        sheet was scrawled with several versions of an allegorical design, feebly
                        drawn, scarcely more than outlined, and, as it seemed, in a moment of
                            weariness.<pb n="292" xml:id="VAB7109-289"/> A beautiful naked youth was
                        clutched by a huge, haggard woman, her torn dress licking his body like
                        flames, her lips greedily advancing to his delicate face, which shrank back,
                        like a flower withering in the heat of a furnace. There were several
                        versions, crossing and recrossing each other oddly, but always the same
                        flower‐like winged boy writhing in the terrible breath of this embrace,
                        always that fainting beautiful face, and those burning lips with the suction
                        of flame. Beneath one of the versions was scrawled, “Amor a Libidine
                        interfectus,” and a few lines, half scratched out, of a sonnet. Anne did not
                        read them; she put down the sketch‐book. She knew the sense of that
                        allegory, even before her eye caught the words, “and thus my soul,” which
                        formed one of the lines of the rough‐scrawled sonnet. Anne shuddered. Steps
                        came along the corridor—Hamlin’s steps. She sat down near the window, for
                        she expected her heart would have begun beating even to bursting. But it was
                        not so; Miss Brown felt wonderfully calm.</p>
                    <pb n="293" xml:id="VAB7109-290"/>
                    <p>“I want to talk to you about something, Mr Hamlin,” she said, when he had
                        recovered from the surprise of finding her in the studio. “You have nothing
                        very pressing to do just now, I hope?”</p>
                    <p>“Nothing,” answered Hamlin; “I am at your disposal.” He sat down opposite to
                        her, and began to fidget with the pencils and pen‐knives lying on the table.
                        He was very pale, haggard, and looked tired and worried.</p>
                    <p>“You don’t seem well,” said Anne, mechanically.</p>
                    <p>“I am horribly nervous, that’s all,” he answered, passing his hand through
                        his hair. “I suppose it’s this damp heat. Will it annoy you if I smoke a
                        cigarette? I feel my brain spinning.”</p>
                    <p>Anne nodded, and waited in silence till he had taken two or three puffs.</p>
                    <p>“Mr Hamlin,” she suddenly began, in a low, steady voice, rather like a person
                        reciting a lesson, “it is going on three years since I left Coblenz and came
                        into this house. I am over<pb n="294" xml:id="VAB7109-291"/> twenty‐four,
                        and I don’t think it is possible to continue much longer on the theory that
                        I am your ward. It is time that something should be decided about my
                        future.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin listened quietly, with a certain listless and helpless look that was
                        very painful.</p>
                    <p>“I quite agree with you,” he answered, “and I fully see how greatly I am to
                        blame in not having forestalled you. You must not suppose that I have not
                        thought more than once about this matter. I have done so, I assure you. But
                        somehow, things have always come in the way; and then, you know, I—I did not
                        wish to put any pressure upon you. In short, I am unable to say how it is
                        that I have placed myself in what may appear to be the wrong in this
                        matter.”</p>
                    <p>Again he passed his hand across his head.</p>
                    <p>“Forgive me,” he said, “for being so feeble this morning. I really have a
                        wretched headache.”</p>
                    <p>“I am very sorry for you,” answered Anne, but adding with the same deliberate resolution<pb n="295" xml:id="VAB7109-292"/>, “but all the same, I feel that I can no longer delay, and that I
                        must avail myself of this opportunity to ask you a question. Have you any
                        intention of marrying me?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin, who had been sitting with his head resting on his hand, vacantly
                        watching the wreathing smoke of his cigarette, suddenly looked up at Anne.
                        She was seated very erect in a high‐backed chair opposite, looking taller,
                        calmer than ever, less girlish than ever also, although he had never thought
                        of her, even years ago, as a girl. He looked at her for a moment in silence;
                        a long, lingering, and very melancholy look.</p>
                    <p>“Miss Brown,” he answered, and his voice became tremulous towards the end of
                        his speech, “you have, if you remember the terms of our reciprocal
                        engagement, always been free; and you are free. It is rather sad for me to
                        reflect—and perhaps a little sad for you also—how very differently things
                        have turned out from what I believe both of us anticipated. And it is, as
                        you may understand, not a little<pb n="296" xml:id="VAB7109-293"/> sad to
                        part with what has been the best thing in my life—to end my best episode.
                        But you must remember that I never wished you to be otherwise than perfectly
                        independent; it has been a great matter in a useless life like mine to have
                        contributed to reinstate you, as it were, in your birthright; it will be
                        something to think of later, that I have been conducive in making you what
                        you are; and”—Hamlin had risen from his chair and stretched out his
                        hand—“will you believe me also when I say that I am very, very happy that
                        you have found a man whom you can love and respect, and who can make you
                        happy?”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin’s mouth, that delicate mouth with the uncertain lines, began to
                        quiver. Anne turned very red, and then, suddenly, very white. She did not
                        take his hand; she did not look at him as he stood before her; her eyes
                        seemed fixed in space, as she answered in a voice which became steadier and
                        louder as she went on—</p>
                    <p>“You don’t understand me. I was not<pb n="297" xml:id="VAB7109-294"/>
                        alluding to any notion of marrying my cousin. I don’t want to marry Richard.
                        What I want to ask you is this: Will you marry me, Mr Hamlin?”</p>
                    <p>Anne, spoke very slowly, gravely, and calmly; but as she spoke, she felt her
                        heart tighten. There remained still one chance, one shred of hope, and in
                        another moment that might be gone.</p>
                    <p>A sudden convulsion passed over Hamlin’s face; he caught at the back of a
                        chair, for he seemed trembling and reeling, his eyes closed for a moment as
                        if he were choking, and he made a vague helpless movement with one hand, as
                        a man who cannot speak. Then, suddenly, he flung himself down before Miss
                        Brown’s chair, seized both her hands, and covered his face with them.</p>
                    <p>“Anne—Anne!” he cried.</p>
                    <p>They remained thus for a moment; she seated upright in the chair, he on his
                        knees, her hands pressed to his face.</p>
                    <p>“Anne—you love me,” he murmured.</p>
                    <pb n="298" xml:id="VAB7109-295"/>
                    <p>Miss Brown did not answer. She looked straight before her into space,
                        fixedly, vaguely, taking in nothing, with her solemn, tearless, grey eyes.
                        She felt as if she were waiting she knew not for what, counting the tickings
                        of an unheard clock.</p>
                    <p>“You love me, Anne; you love me!” cried Hamlin, louder; and pressing closer
                        to her, he put out his arms, and drew down her face to his, and kissed her,
                        twice, thrice, a long kiss on the mouth.</p>
                    <p>It seemed to Anne as if she felt again the throttling arms of Sacha Elaguine
                        about her neck, her convulsive kiss on her face, the cloud of her drowsily
                        scented hair stifling her. She drew back, and loosened his grasp with her
                        strong hands.</p>
                    <p>Hamlin sprang up. His face was changed: he was radiant. He took her hand in
                        both his, and looked long into her eyes.</p>
                    <p>“Forgive me,” he whispered; “forgive me—oh, forgive me, Anne. That all this
                        time I should have been so blind—thought<pb n="299" xml:id="VAB7109-296"/>
                        you indifferent and contemptuous. Oh, forgive me for all my wickedness, my
                        folly; forgive me, my darling, for not having understood that I belonged to
                        you, that you loved me.”</p>
                    <p>Anne nodded without speaking. She could not tell a lie, even now; and she
                        knew she must not tell the truth. Yet never perhaps had she loathed Hamlin
                        as she loathed him—vain, fatuously happy—at this moment that he believed she
                        had confessed that she loved him.</p>
                    <p>“Well, then,” she said quickly, “perhaps you can understand that—after what
                        has passed, you understand—I am anxious that we should get married at once.
                        Perry was asking me, only the other day, why things had dragged on so long;
                        and then also there is . . .”</p>
                    <p>“I understand,” interrupted Hamlin. “Oh, forgive me, dearest. I never, never
                        really loved that woman: I could not have loved her. I have never loved but
                        you. Will you believe it?”</p>
                    <pb n="300" xml:id="VAB7109-297"/>
                    <p>“You will never see her again?—I mean, never except in my presence? ” went on
                        Anne. “Will you promise that? And will you promise to leave London in a day
                        or two—to go to Italy, anywhere where she is not—and wait till I can join
                        you with Aunt Claudia?”</p>
                    <p>“I promise; I will do anything. Oh, Anne, if only you will forget all that;
                        if you will believe me when I tell you that I never loved that woman—that I
                        felt the whole time that she was debasing, humiliating me, making me forfeit
                        all my honour and my happiness . . .”</p>
                    <p>Anne paid no attention to these assurances. So he was shifting all the shame
                        of his weakness and baseness and sensuality on to another,—washing his hands
                        of the woman who had given herself to him. How like him! How well, how
                        terribly well, Anne knew him!</p>
                    <p>“You have promised, remember,” she repeated,—“you will leave to‐morrow, the
                        day after—as soon as you can. You won’t tell her where you are going—do you
                        understand? You will write to‐day, and tell her of our<pb n="301" xml:id="VAB7109-298"/> marriage, and that you have promised never to see
                        her again.”</p>
                    <p>Hamlin kissed her hand with passion.</p>
                    <p>“And listen,” went on Miss Brown; “this evening there is a big party at the
                        Argiropoulos. I did not intend going; but I wish to go now. Write to Mrs
                        Argiropoulo to tell her we are coming together; explain that we are going to
                        be married; ask her to tell all her guests. I want every one to know. Do you
                        understand, Mr Hamlin—Walter, I mean? You won’t lose time, will you?”</p>
                    <p>“No, no!” cried Hamlin; “I understand. Only forgive me; and tell me that you
                        love me, my darling;” and he seized Anne, and kissed her again with a sort
                        of fury. “Tell me that you forgive me for all that I have made you suffer,
                        Anne. Speak,—only one word, Anne—one word.”</p>
                    <p>Anne covered her eyes with her hand.</p>
                    <p>“I forgive you, Walter,” she answered, and burst into tears. But she wiped
                        them away, and, rising suddenly, left the room.</p>
                    <pb n="302" xml:id="VAB7109-299"/>
                    <p>“Walter is leaving for Italy to‐morrow,” she said, as she met Melton Perry in
                        the corridor. “I want you to accompany me and Aunt Claudia there in a few
                        days. Mr Hamlin and I are going to be married.”</p>
                    <p>“God bless my soul!” cried Perry. “When—where—why didn’t you tell me before?”
                        But Anne was out of sight.</p>

                    <p><hi>IN</hi> the blazing drawing‐room, where a crowd of black coats and
                        shining bare shoulders and fashionable dresses contrasted drolly with the
                        melancholy thin Cupids of Burne Jones, the mournful mysterious ladies of
                        Rossetti, which adorned the walls, one of Mrs Argiropoulo’s many musical
                        celebrities was wailing Austrian popular songs at the piano. Miss Brown, who
                        had undergone the universal staring and received the general congratulations
                        with a monosyllabic composure much criticised on all hands, had slipped
                        away, when the Austrian tenor approached the piano, to the furthest end of
                        the room, where she was half protected from sight by the plants of an
                        adjacent conservatory. All this triumph, people said to themselves<pb n="304" xml:id="VAB7109-301"/>, as they looked round at her seated alone in the corner, dressed
                        in a wonderful garment of cloth‐of‐silver, resting her dark head on her
                        hand, was too much even for her. Yet in reality Miss Brown did not feel any
                        emotion; she was too tired for that. She felt as if she had just finished a
                        long journey, or as she used sometimes to do years ago after a hard
                        morning’s ironing in summer—weary, broken, too numb for thought or for pain.
                        The guttural voice of the Austrian tenor, wailing out the simple little
                        mountain songs, which would at any other time have brought the tears into
                        her eyes and a thought of death into her heart, seemed to her vague and
                        distant like a voice in a dream; and like a crowd seen through a mist seemed
                        all these very concrete men and women all about her. As the last notes of
                        the song died away, she felt the touch of a fan, the downy stroke of a bunch
                        of feathers, on her neck. It was Madame Elaguine behind her; but the sight
                        of Madame Elaguine caused Anne no emotion, and she<pb n="305" xml:id="VAB7109-302"/> followed the Russian woman, who beckoned her into
                        the neighbouring conservatory, in the same absent way as she had answered
                        the congratulations of her acquaintances.</p>
                    <p>“You are very tired, Annie dear,” said Madame Elaguine, in one of her
                        caressing half‐whispers, but fixing her eyes on Miss Brown with a look which
                        was anything but a caress. “All this emotion—this general ovation and
                        triumph, this great joy of satisfied love—has been too much for you, poor
                        child!”</p>
                    <p>Anne shook her head, thrown back on the Persian embroidery of an ottoman,
                        among the large tropical leaves and the delicate stems of bamboos and fern
                        plants. She knew that this woman wished to insult her; but she was too weary
                        and absent‐minded to care.</p>
                    <p>“I am merely rather tired. I didn’t get much sleep last night,” she answered,
                        as she might have answered the maid who pulled up her blinds in the morning.
                        Madame Elaguine seemed a hundred miles away from her: she<pb n="306" xml:id="VAB7109-303"/> shrank neither from a woman whom she loathed, nor
                        from a woman who, she felt, was bent upon insulting her.</p>
                    <p>She did not feel Madame Elaguine’s glance, although the glance was
                        concentrated hatred and outrage.</p>
                    <p>“Poor child!” repeated Sacha, taking one of her hands and pressing it between
                        her own burning ones. “Poor child! Ah, well, I won’t bore you with
                        congratulations. I know Walter sufficiently well to know how happy he will
                        make you; and I know how deeply you have loved him all the while, and how
                        faithfully he has always loved you. But I want to give you a little
                        wedding‐present. I have brought it here, because Walter has written to me
                        that you don’t want to have your bliss disturbed, and are going off at once.
                        Quite right. When people are very happy, there’s something immodest in
                        letting the world see it and be jealous; that’s the classic view, isn’t it?”
                        As she spoke she drew from out of her cloud of lace and feather trimmings a
                        little leathern case.</p>
                    <pb n="307" xml:id="VAB7109-304"/>
                    <p>“Oh dear no,” went on Madame Elaguine, “you mustn’t think I’ve been ruining
                        myself. I’m far too much of a pauper and far too selfish to go making
                        handsome presents. It doesn’t cost me anything, you see, for Walter gave me
                        them last month; and as I really don’t care a jackstraw about pearls, and I
                        accepted them merely to please him, I think it’s much better you should have
                        them to make the set complete, since you have the necklace.”</p>
                    <p>The case contained two large pearl ear‐rings, which Anne immediately
                        recognised as part of the set once belonging to Hamlin’s mother which he had
                        shown her long ago at Wotton. Round her own neck was the former Mrs Hamlin’s
                        pearl necklace; he had given it to her that evening, not a fortnight,
                        perhaps, since giving Sacha the ear‐rings.</p>
                    <p>Anne looked at the ear‐rings for a moment, feeling the triumphant eyes of
                        Sacha upon her; she felt also her face grow crimson, and her soul waking out
                        of its state of lethargic indifference, with a fierce desire to tear the
                            pearls<pb n="308" xml:id="VAB7109-305"/> off her own throat, and crush
                        them into the carpet with her foot.</p>
                    <p>“Thank you,” she merely said, closing the box and handing it back to Sacha;
                        “I don’t think I could wear them, Madame Elaguine. And I don’t think my
                        husband would wish me to wear them,” she added, but the words half stuck in
                        her throat.</p>
                    <p>“Won’t you, really?” said the Russian. “I assure you Walter will be most
                        mortified if he hear that you have refused them. It would be a hundred
                        pities that the set should be spoilt. I wouldn’t have taken these, if he
                        hadn’t told me that I should have the rest. You see, I was the nearest of
                        kin last month. And I’m sure it would make poor Aunt Philippa turn in her
                        grave to know that all her things did not go to Miss Anne Brown. Ah, well—as
                        you like. I can always get them exchanged at the jeweller’s for something
                        else—or I’ll tell Walter, and he can buy them back for you. That’s more like
                        a pauper’s proceeding.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you, Madame Elaguine,” said Anne,<pb n="309" xml:id="VAB7109-306"/>
                        preparing to rise, “I think I ought to go and talk to some of the people in
                        the next room.”</p>
                    <p>But Madame Elaguine laid hold of her wrist. “Don’t go yet, my dear Madonna of
                        the Glaciers—I shan’t see you again, perhaps, for a long while, and I want
                        you to tell me some things. I’m a horrible ill‐bred little creature, I know,
                        but I can’t help it. I’ve always had a lot of morbid curiosities. One of
                        them is how love‐marriages are made up—how it all comes about. You see I
                        wasn’t married for love—I was married for money by my Russian relations. But
                        I always think I should like to know about love‐marriages. Tell me what
                        Walter said to you—how he did it. I wish I’d seen it.”</p>
                    <p>Anne’s face was burning. Each of Madame Elaguine’s words was a piece of
                        insolence.</p>
                    <p>“Did you always love him—ever since the beginning—ever since he sent you to
                        school; and have you always gone on caring for him in the same way?” went on
                        Madame Elaguine. “Fancy, I thought you didn’t care much for<pb n="310" xml:id="VAB7109-307"/> Walter, almost disliked him; I almost thought you
                        were in love with your big black cousin. It was like my obtuseness! Do tell
                        me all about it . . .”</p>
                    <p>“There is nothing to tell you, Madame Elaguine,” said Anne. “Mr Hamlin and I
                        are going to be married, that’s all.”</p>
                    <p>“In short,” answered Madame Elaguine, bursting into an angry laugh, “you
                        thought better of it; you learned to appreciate the satisfaction of getting
                        a handsome husband, with a good name and a good fortune. I think you are
                        quite right. Mrs Hamlin of Wotton sounds better than Mrs Richard Brown. Or
                        else are you still sufficiently human to enjoy making a man give the cold
                        shoulder to another woman? I fear I must spoil your satisfaction in this. I
                        have never cared a button for Walter. I would not have married Walter for
                        anything you could offer me; I only cared to bring down his pride a little,
                        in remembrance of the days when his great virtue of seventeen had me turned
                        out of my uncle’s house, like a<pb n="311" xml:id="VAB7109-308"/> housemaid
                        who has made love with the butler. As to Walter himself, you are welcome to
                        him, though I don’t promise that some day the whim may not return to me to
                        amuse myself a little more at his expense.” Miss Brown looked at Madame
                        Elaguine with disgust: this delicate charming little creature seemed
                        suddenly transformed into Mrs Perry’s housemaid Beppa, whom she had
                        overtaken one day, years ago in Florence, browbeating and insulting the
                        laundress’s girl, accusing her of trying to get between herself and the
                        man‐cook.</p>
                    <p>“All this is very useless and disagreeable,” she said, rising to go.
                        “Good‐bye, Madame Elaguine.”</p>
                    <p>But Sacha laid her hand on Miss Brown’s arm.</p>
                    <p>“I see,” she said, “your friend and former master Mr Perry has been
                        entertaining you with anecdotes of my life, and perhaps Edmund Lewis has
                        been doing so also. Very shocking, weren’t they? Well, I won’t insult you
                        any longer with my presence. But I<pb n="312" xml:id="VAB7109-309"/> think
                        it’s as well that you should know in time that if I have been in the mud
                        according to your ideas, Walter Hamlin has been into it with me. It’s rather
                        difficult to make such things clear to a Madonna of the Glaciers, but
                        perhaps Mr Perry will help you to understand the matter. To put it plainly,
                        ever since you fell ill, Walter has been my lover.”</p>
                    <p>The little woman spoke in a very low but very distinct voice, unabashed,
                        brazen, almost smiling. She said the last words not in shame, but in
                        triumph; hurled them at Anne as an outrage, almost as a thunderbolt.</p>
                    <p>“I knew it already,” answered Miss Brown, gathering her white brocade skirts
                        about her.</p>
                    <p>“You knew it!” exclaimed Madame Elaguine, staring at her as if she could not
                        believe her ears.</p>
                    <p>“You knew it!” she repeated after a moment, a sudden triumphant scorn coming
                        into her face. “You knew it, and you make him marry you all the same! Well,
                        I wish you all possible happiness, and I rejoice that<pb n="313" xml:id="VAB7109-310"/> Walter has got a wife who understands so well how
                        to deal with him. As to me, pray don’t think that I bear you any malice. I
                        am only surprised and amused; and extremely interested, from the
                        psychological point of view, in finding that a virtuous woman may condescend
                        to things which would turn the stomach of a woman who has no pretence to
                        virtue.”</p>
                    <p>Anne brushed aside the palm‐leaves and ferns of the conservatory door. A
                        sudden pain, as of a blow with the fist, was at her heart. She did not
                        answer, for she felt that there was truth in Sacha’s insult.</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown had forgotten that ignominy is an almost indispensable part of all
                        martyrdom.</p>
                    <p>She found Hamlin standing in a little knot of friends.</p>
                    <p>“I fear I must be going home rather early,” he said, “as I set off for the
                        Italian lakes tomorrow morning, and all my packing still remains to be done.
                        And I think,” he added, with a kind of supplicating look, “that Miss<pb n="314" xml:id="VAB7109-311"/> Brown looks rather tired also, and ought
                        to let me escort her home.”</p>
                    <p>Anne nodded. She saw the burly shoulders, the bushy black head of Richard
                        Brown in the crowd, and she dreaded meeting him.</p>
                    <p>“Let us go,” she said.</p>
                    <p>But as they were turning away, Richard made his way to his cousin.</p>
                    <p>“Good evening, Annie,” he said, in an off‐hand voice; “I have had no
                        opportunity of congratulating you and Mr Hamlin.”</p>
                    <p>“Thank you, Dick,” answered Miss Brown, her eyes mechanically avoiding his.
                        “I’m sorry it’s so late; the carriage is at the door, and Mr Hamlin and I
                        must be leaving.”</p>
                    <p>“Ah, very good!” said Brown. “Well, then, I will take you down, and help you
                        to get your wraps, while Mr Hamlin finishes taking leave of his friends.” He
                        gave a contemptuous nod to Hamlin, waited for Anne to have said good‐bye to
                        her friends, and pushed his way with her through the crowd, while<pb n="315" xml:id="VAB7109-312"/> Mrs Argiropoulo murmured, for the thirtieth or
                        fortieth time that evening—</p>
                    <p>“Well, I must say it is a satisfaction to see two people who are really made
                        for each other, like Walter Hamlin and dear Anne.”</p>
                    <p>There was no one as yet in the highly æsthetic study, which had been turned
                        into a perfect exhibition of fantastic shawls and opera‐cloaks. They had
                        said nothing while going down‐stairs, and even now Richard Brown was silent,
                        as he hunted about for his cousin’s cloak.</p>
                    <p>“Anne, are you there?” asked Hamlin’s voice from the corridor.</p>
                    <p>Richard Brown’s heavy brows contracted. “Here’s your fan,” he said, stooping
                        to pick it up. “Good‐bye, Nan! I hope you may be happy—”</p>
                    <p>She stretched out her hand. “Good‐bye, Dick!” said Miss Brown, raising her
                        eyes shyly upon him; “you have been very good to me—”</p>
                    <p>Richard looked at her for a moment as she stood under the lamp, in her
                        shimmering white<pb n="316" xml:id="VAB7109-313"/> dress. Then, as she was
                        going away on Hamlin’s entrance, he turned round suddenly to her and
                        murmured, in his hot angry whisper—</p>
                    <p>“Good‐bye, Nan—you mercenary creature!”</p>
                    <p>A few intimate friends had assembled near the hall door, to say good‐bye.</p>
                    <p>“Here, Mr Chough,” cried fat old Mr Saunders, the impeccable disciple of Fra
                        Angelico, “you’ll be just in time to write a nice bridal ode while Miss
                        Brown packs her boxes to‐morrow. Mind you cut out Spenser and Suckling and
                        all the rest of them, old boy.”</p>
                    <p>Cosmo Chough, his cat‐like black whiskers brushed fiercely over a shirt
                        fantastically frilled and starched, to show his eighteenth‐century
                        proclivities, made one of his beautiful bows.</p>
                    <p>“Some better poet than I must write that ode,” he said; “all that her poor
                        servant Cosmo can do, is to thank Miss Brown from all his heart for marrying
                        his dearest friend.”</p>
                    <p>Anne heard the voice of the Poet of Womanhood vaguely, distantly, like all
                        the others.</p>
                    <pb n="317" xml:id="VAB7109-314"/>
                    <p>“Is the carriage there, Mr Hamlin?” she asked.</p>
                    <p>“Here it is. Good night! Good‐bye!” cried Hamlin. He jumped in after her.</p>
                    <p>“Oh, Anne! that you should really have loved me all this time—you, really
                        you; and that I should never have understood it,” he whispered, pressing her
                        hand, as the carriage rolled off.</p>
                    <p>“Are you cold, my love?”</p>
                    <p>Miss Brown suddenly shivered, as he put his arm round her shoulder. The flash
                        of a street lamp as they passed quickly, had shown her Hamlin’s face close
                        to her own, and radiant with the triumph of satisfied vanity.</p>
