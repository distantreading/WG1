                    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                    <p>TOWARDS the close of last July, when the London season was fast dying of the
                        dust, Otho Laurence had invited what the <hi>Morning Post</hi> called ‘a
                        select circle of friends,’ to spend a quiet Sunday with him at his cool
                        villa by the sea. </p>
                    <p> This singular retreat was the work of a very singular man, Otho Laurence’s
                        uncle, who had squandered on it an immense fortune, and had designed it as
                        far as possible to embody his own tastes and character. He was a member of a
                        Tory family of some note, and had near relations in both Houses of
                        Parliament; but he was himself possessed of a deep though quiet antipathy to
                        the two things generally most cherished by those of his time and order, the
                        ideas of Christianity and Feudalism; and he studiously kept himself clear of
                        all public life. Pride of birth, indeed, he had in no small measure; but it
                        was the pride of a Roman of the Empire rather than of an Englishman; a pride
                        which, instead of connecting him with prince or people, made him shun the
                        one as a Cæsar, and forget the other as slaves. All his pleasures were those
                        of a lettered voluptuary, who would, as he himself said, have been more in
                        place under Augustus or the Antonines; and modern existence, under most of
                        its aspects, he affected to regard as barbarous. Next to a bishop, the thing
                        he most disliked was a courtier; next to a courtier, a fox-hunting country
                        gentleman. But nothing in his life, perhaps, was so characteristic of him as
                        his leaving of it. During his last hours he was soothed by a pretty and
                        somewhat educated housemaid, whom he called Phyllis, and whom he made sit by
                        his bedside, and read aloud to him Gibbon’s two chapters on Christianity.
                        Phyllis had just come to the celebrated excerpt from Tertullian, in which
                        that father contemplates the future torments of the unbelievers, when the
                        parish clergyman, who had been sent for by Mr. Laurence’s widowed
                        sister-in-law, arrived to offer his services. </p>
                    <p> ‘How shall I admire’<note n="1"><p> Vide <hi>Gibbon’s Decline and Fall</hi>,
                                chapter xv.</p></note>—these were the words that, read in a low
                        sweet tone, first greeted his ears when he was shown softly into the sick
                        chamber—‘ how shall I admire, how laugh, how rejoice, how exult, when I
                        behold so many proud monarchs, so many fancied gods, groaning in the lowest
                        abyss of darkness; so many magistrates who persecuted the name of the Lord,
                        liquefying in a fiercer fire than ever they kindled against the Christians!’
                        The clergyman was at first much reassured at hearing words so edifying; but
                        when he turned to old Mr. Laurence, he was dismayed to see on his pale face,
                        no signs of awe, but only a faint smile, full of sarcastic humour. He
                        therefore glanced at the book that was lying on the girl’s lap, and
                        discovered to his horror the work of the infidel historian. He was at first
                        struck dumb; but, soon recovering himself, began to say something suitable
                        at once to his own profession and to the sick man’s needs. Mr. Laurence
                        answered him with the greatest courtesy, but with many thanks declined any
                        assistance from him; saying wistfully that he knew he had not long to live,
                        and that his one wish was that he could open his veins in a bath, and so
                        fade gently into death; ‘and then,’ he added, ‘my soul, if I have one, might
                        perhaps be with Petronius, and with Seneca. And yet sleep would, I think, be
                        better than even their company.’ The poor clergyman bade a hasty adieu, and
                        Phyllis resumed her reading. Mr. Laurence listened to every word: the smile
                        returned to his lips that had for a moment left them, and was still upon
                        them when, half-an-hour afterwards, he died, so quietly that Phyllis did not
                        perceive it, but continued her reading for some time to ears that could hear
                        nothing. </p>
                    <p> All his property he left to his nephew Otho, including his splendid villa,
                        which was indeed, as it was meant to be, a type of its builder. It was a
                        house of pillars, porticoes, and statues, designed ambitiously in what was
                        meant to be a classical style; and though its splendours might not be all
                        perhaps in the best taste, nor even of the most strictly Roman pattern,
                        there was yet an air about its meretricious stateliness by which the clays
                        of the Empire were at once suggested to one, a magnificence that: would at
                        any rate have pleased Trimalcio, though it might have scandalised Horace.
                            <note> The present writer has so little skill in describing fine houses
                            that he would have been here much at a loss, had not a fashionable lady
                            novelist who knew the one in question — having been, in fact, the
                            daughter of the housekeeper there — come to his assistance, and dictated
                            the following description to him ; which, owing to a slight difference in the
                            style, he has been unable to incorporate into the text. ‘There above the
                            sea, and overlooking it, with the everlasting sea- breeze in its Parian
                            porticoes, stood the villa, of which a Roman noble might have been proud
                            — in which a Lucullus might have feasted, or a Clodius wreathed the
                            brows of Aspasia with rose-petals. Laurence's Folly the simple country
                            folk termed it ; and folly perhaps it was, but a splendid folly, and one
                            of which none but a patrician, whose blood beat blue from the heart to
                            the taper finger-tips, could have been ever guilty. Its lofty pillared
                            halls with their tessellated floors — work of cunning artists from over
                            sea struck dumb with awed amazement such of the favoured country squires
                            as had occasional access to them, with their buxom wives decked in their
                            best apparel, and their daughters arrayed in the flimsy fashion of the
                            neighbouring town. Rare exotics glowing in marble vases perfumed the air
                            exquisite frescoes on the wall caught the eye. Greek statues, in their
                            mute immortal loveliness, rested calmly upon their granite plinths. In
                            the libraries and drawing-rooms stood cabinets full of priceless
                            antiquities, any one of which would have dowered an Earl's daughter.
                            Jars and vases from China and Japan, Roman hand-mirrors, in which
                            Faustina had perhaps surveyed her more than human loveliness, iridescent
                            phials of glass, in which Locusta had perhaps stored her poisons,
                            luxurious couches, some covered with purple velvet, some with crimson,
                            inlaid tables, paintings, marbles, bronzes by immortal masters ——’ The
                            lady, who had once helped to make an inventory of the chief valuables in
                            the house, went on to repeat, in a more coloured form, as much of it as
                            she recollected. She then proceeded: ‘Here, in this superb retirement,
                            dwelt Otho Laurence, the celebrated epicurean of modern society — here
                            seeking retirement from the caresses of the selectest circles in London,
                            in a yet selecter circle of his own. All day long, through his gilded
                            rooms, sounds of soft music stole and dainty-footed Circassian girls,
                            and stealthy Odalisques, looking like strayed houris from Paradise ——’
                            The author here interposed to tell her that on Otho Laurence was not at
                            all such a man as she described, nor in the least given to such company.
                            She immediately, seeing one road barred, started off with fresh alacrity
                            on another: ‘ Often on the broad terrace outside, during the long summer
                            evenings, haughty and titled groups of the English Aristocracy watched
                            the crimson after-glow die away over the long horizon. Here it was that
                            Ivo de Grantmesnil, a scion of one of the proudest English houses, which
                            had thrice refused a peerage that had been laid at his feet——’ But our
                            friend had automatically begun a novel, with which we are not concerned
                            at this moment. </note>
                    </p>
                    <p> Otho Laurence inherited with his uncle’s house something of the tastes and
                        feelings of which it was the embodiment. But, though an epicure by training
                        and by temper, he had been open to other influences as well. At one time of
                        his life he had, as it is expressed by some, experienced religion; and not
                        religion only, but thought and speculation also. Indeed, ever since he was
                        twenty-four, he had been troubled by a painful sense that he ought to have
                        some mission in life. The only difficulty was that he could find none that
                        would suit him. He had considerable natural powers, and was in many ways a
                        remarkable man; but, unhappily, one of those who are remarkable because they
                        do not become famous, not because they do. He was one of those of whom it is
                        said till they are thirty, that they will do something; till they are
                        thirty-five, that they might do something if they chose; and after that,
                        that they might have done anything if they had chosen. Laurence was as yet
                        only three years gone in the second stage, but such of his friends as were
                        ambitious for him feared that three years more would find him landed in the
                        third. He, too, was beginning to share this fear; and, not being humble
                        enough to despair of himself, was by this time taking to despair of his
                        century. He was thus hardly a happy man; but, like many unhappy men, he was
                        capable of keen enjoyments. Chief amongst these was society in certain
                        forms, especially a party in his own house, such as that which he had now
                        assembled there. To this one in particular he looked forward with more than
                        usual pleasure, partly because of the peculiar elements which he had
                        contrived to combine in it, but chiefly because amongst them was to be his
                        friend Robert Leslie, who had been living abroad, and whom he had not seen
                        for two years. </p>
                    <p> Laurence’s aunt, Lady Grace, helped to receive the guests, who by
                        dinner-time on Saturday evening had all arrived. Robert Leslie was the last.
                        The dressing-bell had just done ringing as he drove up to the door, and the
                        others had already gone upstairs; but he found Laurence in the library,
                        sitting with his head on his hand, and a pile of <hi>menu</hi>-cards on the
                        desk before him. The two friends met with much warmth, and then examined
                        each other’s faces to see if either had changed. </p>
                    <p> ‘You told me you had been ill,’ said Laurence, having again looked at
                        Leslie, ‘and I am afraid you don’t seem quite well yet.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You forget,’ said Leslie, whose laugh was a little hollow, ‘that I was on
                        the sea six hours ago; and, as you know, I am a wretched sailor. But the
                        worst of human maladies are the most transient also—love , that is half
                        despairing, and sea-sickness that is quite so.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I congratulate you,’ said Laurence, again examining his friend’s face, ‘on
                        your true cynical manner. I often thought we might have masters in cynicism
                        just as we have masters in singing. Perhaps I shall be able to learn the art
                        from you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh!’ said Leslie, ‘the theory is simple enough. Find out, by a little
                        suffering, what are the things you hold most sacred, and most firmly believe
                        in, and, whenever an occasion offers, deny your faith. A cynic is a kind of
                        inverted confessor, perpetually making enemies for the sake of what he knows
                        to be false.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ said Laurence, ‘but I don’t want theory. I know what is sacred just as
                        well as you, and, when I am beast enough to be quite out of tune with it, I
                        have the good sense to call it a phantom. But I don’t do this with
                        sufficient energy. It is skill in cynical practice I want—a lesson in the
                        pungent manner—the bitter tone—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Then please not to take your lessons from me,’ said Leslie. ‘Imitation may
                        be the sincerest flattery, but it is, of all, the most irritating: and a
                        cynic, as you are good enough to call me, feels this especially. For a cynic
                        is the one preacher, remember, that never wants to make converts. His aim is
                        to outrage, not to convince: to create enemies, not to conquer them. The
                        peculiar charm that his creed has for him, is his own peculiarity in holding
                        it. He is an acid that can only fizz with an alkali, and he therefore hates
                        in others what he most admires in himself. So if you hear me say a bitter
                        thing, please be good enough to brim over immediately with the milk of human
                        kindness. If I say anything disrespectful about friendship, please be good
                        enough to look hurt; and if I happen to say—what is the chief part of the
                        cynic’s stock-in-trade—that no woman was ever sincere or faithful, I trust
                        you have some lady amongst your visitors who will look at me with mournful
                        eyes, and say to me, “Ah, if you did but know!”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘perhaps I have; but, talking of what people are to
                        say, I have something here about which I want you to help me. You see these
                        cards; they are all double. Now that second half is for something quite new,
                        and of my own invention. The cook has written his part already, so you need
                        not look so alarmed; but he has only provided for the tongue as a tasting
                        instrument; I am going to provide for it as a talking one. In fact, I am
                        going to have a <hi>menu</hi> for the conversation, and to this I shall make
                        everyone strictly adhere. For it has always seemed absurd to me to be so
                        careful about what we put into our mouths, and to leave chance to arrange
                        what comes out of them; to be so particular as to the order of what we eat,
                        and to have no order at all in what we talk about. This is the case
                        especially in parties like the present, where most of the people know each
                        other only a little, and if left to themselves would never touch on the
                        topics that would make them best acquainted, and best bring out their
                        several personal flavours. That is what I like to see conversation doing. I
                        ought to have written these <hi>menus</hi> before; but I have been busy all
                        day, and, besides, I wanted you to help me. I was just beginning without you
                        when you arrived, as I could wait no longer; but I have put down nothing
                        yet: indeed I could not fix upon the first topic that is to correspond with
                        the soup—the first vernal breath of discussion that is to open the buds of
                        the shy and strange souls. So come, now—what shall we begin with? What we
                        want is something that anyone can talk easily about, whether he knows
                        anything of it or not—something, too, that may be treated in any way, either
                        with laughter, feeling, or even a little touch of temper.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Love,’ suggested Leslie. </p>
                    <p> ‘That is too strong to begin with,’ said Laurence, ‘and too real. Besides,
                        introduced in that way, it would be, I think, rather common and vulgar.
                        No—the only thing that suggested itself to me was religion.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Nothing could be better in some ways,’ said Leslie; ‘but might not that,
                        too, be rather strong meat for some? I apprehend, like Bottom, that “the
                        ladies might be afeared of the lion.” I should suggest rather the question,
                        “Are you High-church or Low-church?” There is something in that which at
                        once disarms reverence, and may also just titillate the interests, the
                        temper, or the sense of humour. Quick,’ he said, taking one of the cards,
                        ‘and let us begin to write.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Stop,’ said Laurence; ‘not so fast, let me beg of you. Instead of religion,
                        or anything connected with it, we will have, “What is the Aim of Life?” Is
                        not this the thing of things to suit us? About what do we know less or talk
                        more? There is a Sphinx in each of our souls that is always asking us this
                        riddle; and when we are lazy or disappointed, we all of us lounge up to her,
                        and make languid guesses. So about this we shall all of us have plenty to
                        say, and can say it in any way we like, flippant, serious, or sentimental.
                        Think, too, how many avenues of thought and feeling it opens up! Evidently
                        the “Aim of Life” is the thing to begin with.’ </p>
                    <p> Leslie assented; and before many minutes they had made the <hi>menu</hi>
                        complete. </p>
                    <p> The ‘Aim of Life’ was to be followed by ‘Town and Country,’ which was
                        designed to introduce a discussion as to where the Aim of Life was to be
                        best attained. After this, by an easy transition, came ‘Society;’ next by
                        way of <hi>entreés</hi>, ‘Art and Literature,’ ‘Love and Money,’ ‘Riches and
                        Civilisation;’ then ‘The Present,’ as something solid and satisfying; and
                        lastly, a light superfluity to dally with, brightly coloured and
                        unsubstantial, with the <hi>entremets</hi> came ‘The Future.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And who is here,’ said Leslie, as they were ending their labours, ‘to enjoy
                        this feast of reason?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I will tell you,’ said Laurence. ‘In the first place, there is Lady
                        Ambrose, a woman of a very old but poor family, who has married a modern
                        M.P. with more than a million of money. She is very particular about knowing
                        the right people, and has lovely, large grey eyes. Then there is Miss
                        Merton, a Roman Catholic young lady, the daughter of old Sir Ascot Merton,
                        the horse-racing evangelical. I knew her well five years ago, but had not
                        seen her since her conversion, till to-day. Then we have Dr. Jenkinson, the
                        great Broad-church divine who thinks that Christianity is not dead, but
                        changed by himself and his followers in the twinkling of an eye.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I met Dr. Jenkinson,’ said Leslie, ‘just before I went abroad, at a great
                        dinner given by Baron Isaacs, in honour of his horse having won the Derby.
                        Well—and who else is there?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Two celebrated members of the Royal Society,’ said Laurence; ‘no less
                        persons than—But, good gracious! it is time we were up-stairs dressing. Come
                        along directly, and I will explain the other people to you before dinner.’ </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p> IT was half-past eight, and the party were fast assembling in the twilight
                        drawing-room. Leslie was lounging in one of the windows, by a large stand of
                        flowers and broad-leaved plants, and was studying the company with
                        considerable interest. His first impression was of little more than of a
                        number of men’s dark coats and white shirt-fronts, tables, couches, and
                        gilded chairs, and the pleasant many-coloured glimmerings of female apparel.
                        But before long he had observed more minutely. There were men who he
                        instinctively felt were celebrities, discoursing to groups of ladies; there
                        were ladies who he at once saw were attractive, being discoursed to by
                        groups of men. He very soon detected Lady Ambrose, a fine handsome woman of
                        perhaps thirty, with the large grey eyes of which Laurence had spoken, and a
                        very clear complexion. Leslie was much prepossessed by her frank manner, and
                        by her charming voice, as she was talking with some animation to a tall
                        distinguished-looking young man, whose fine features, keen earnest glance,
                        and thoughtful expression prepossessed him still more. Forming a third in
                        this group, dropping in a word or two at intervals, he recognised the
                        celebrated Dr. Jenkinson—still full of vigour, though his hair was
                        silver—the sharp and restless sparkle of whose eyes, strangely joined with
                        the most benevolent of smiles, Leslie remembered to have noticed at Baron
                        Isaacs’ festival. He had just identified Lady Ambrose and the Doctor, when
                        Laurence came up to him in the window, and began to tell him who was who. </p>
                    <p> ‘Dr. Jenkinson is the only one I know,’ said Leslie, ‘and, naturally enough,
                        he forgets me.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘that man by himself, turning over the books on the
                        table—the man with the black whiskers, spectacles, and bushy eyebrows—is Mr.
                        Storks of the Royal Society, who is great on the physical basis of life and
                        the imaginative basis of God. The man with long locks in the window,
                        explaining a microscope in so eager a way to that dark-haired girl, is
                        Professor Stockton—of the Royal Society also; and member and president of
                        many Societies more. The girl—child, rather, I ought to call her—that he is
                        talking to, is Lady Violet Gresham—my second cousin. You see my aunt, the
                        old lady with grey curls, on the ottoman near the fire-place? Well—the
                        supercilious-looking man, talking rather loudly and rather slowly to her
                        about the dust in London, is Mr. Luke, the great critic and apostle of
                        culture. That, too, is another critic close by him—the pale creature, with
                        large moustache, looking out of the window at the sunset. He is Mr. Rose,
                        the pre-Raphaelite. He always speaks in an undertone, and his two topics are
                        self-indulgence and art. The young man there with Lady Ambrose and Dr.
                        Jenkinson, is Lord Allen. He is only two- or three-and-twenty; still, had
                        you been in England lately, you would often have heard his name. He has come
                        early into an immense property, and he yet is conscious that he has duties
                        in life. But,’ said Laurence, sighing, ‘he too feels, as I do, that he has
                        fallen on evil days, in which there can be no peace for us—little but doubt
                        and confusion, and what seems to me a losing battle against the spiritual
                        darkness of this world. However—that redheaded youth thinks very
                        differently. He is Mr. Saunders from Oxford, supposed to be very clever and
                        advanced. Next him is Donald Gordon, who has deserted deer-stalking and the
                        Kirk, for literature and German metaphysics.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And who is that,’ said Leslie,’ the young lady with those large and rather
                        sad-looking eyes, and the delicate, proud mouth?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Which?’ said Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘The one on the sofa,’ said Leslie, ‘who looks so like a Reynolds
                        portrait—like a duchess of the last century—the lady in the pale blue dress,
                        talking to that man with such a curiously attractive smile and the worn
                        melancholy look?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That,’ said Laurence, ‘is Miss Merton. I am glad you admire her. And don’t
                        you know who it is she is talking to? He is almost the only man of these
                        days for whom I feel a real reverence—almost the only one of our teachers
                        who seems to me to speak with the least breath of inspiration. But he is too
                        impressionable, perhaps—too much like me, in that way. And now, as the years
                        come, it seems that hope is more and more leaving him, and things look
                        darker to him than ever. That is Herbert.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Herbert!’ exclaimed Leslie, ‘so it is. I thought I recollected the face. I
                        have heard him lecture several times at the Royal Institution; and that
                        singular voice of his, which would often hold all the theatre breathless,
                        haunts me still, sometimes. There was something strange and aërial in its
                        exquisite modulations, that seemed as if it came from a disconsolate spirit,
                        hovering over the waters of Babylon, and remembering Sion. I can’t tell
                        exactly why it was that—but, ah!—my dear Laurence—who is this, that is
                        coming into the room now—this lovely creature, with a dress like a red
                        azalea? What speaking eyes! And what hair, too—deep dead black, with those
                        white starry blossoms in it. I don’t think I ever saw anyone move so
                        gracefully; and how proudly and piquantly she poises <quote>On her neck the
                            small head buoyant, like a bell-flower on its bed!’</quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘That,’ said Laurence, when Leslie had done, ‘is Mrs. Sinclair, who has
                        published a volume of poems, and is a sort of fashionable London Sappho. But
                        come,—we shall be going into dinner directly. You shall have Lady Ambrose on
                        one side of you, and shall take in Miss Merton.’ </p>

                    <p> LAURENCE, though he had forewarned his guests of his <hi>menu</hi> before
                        they left the drawing-room, yet felt a little anxious when they sat down to
                        dinner; for he found it not altogether easy to get the conversation started.
                        Lady Ambrose, who was the first to speak, began somewhat off the point. </p>
                    <p> ‘What a charming change it is, Mr. Laurence,’ she said, ‘to look out on the
                        sea when one is dressing, instead of across South Audley Street!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Hush!’ said Laurence softly, with a grave, reproving smile. </p>
                    <p> ‘Really,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘I beg your pardon. I thought Dr. Jenkinson had
                        said grace.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘If he has,’ said Laurence, ‘it is very good of him, for I am afraid he was
                        not asked. But what I mean is, that you must only talk of what is on the
                        cards; so be good enough to look at your <hi>menu</hi>, and devote your
                        attention to the Aim of Life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really, this is much too alarming,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘How is one to talk
                        at so short a notice on a subject one has never thought about before? ’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Why, to do so,’ said Laurence, ‘is the very art of conversation; for in
                        that way, one’s ideas spring up fresh like young roses that have all the dew
                        on them, instead of having been kept drying for half a lifetime between the
                        leaves of a book. So do set a good example, and begin, or else we shall
                        never be started at all; and my pet plan will turn out a fiasco.’ </p>
                    <p> There was, indeed, as Laurence said this, something very near complete
                        silence all round the table. It was soon broken. </p>
                    <p> ‘Are you High-church or Low-church?’ was a question suddenly uttered in a
                        quick eager girl’s voice by Miss Prattle, a young lady of eighteen, to the
                        astonishment of the whole company. It was addressed to Dr. Jenkinson who was
                        sitting next her. </p>
                    <p> Had a pin been run into the Doctor’s leg, he could not have looked more
                        astounded, or given a greater start. He eyed his fair questioner for some
                        time in complete silence. </p>
                    <p> ‘Can you tell me the difference?’ he said at last, in a voice of
                        considerable good humour, yet with just a touch of sharpness in it. </p>
                    <p> ‘I think,’ said Miss Merton, who was sitting on the other side of him, ‘that
                        my card is a little different. I have the “Aim of Life” on mine, and so I
                        believe has everybody else.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said the Doctor, laughing, ‘let us ask Miss Prattle what is her aim
                        in life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Thank Heaven,’ said Laurence, ‘Dr. Jenkinson has begun. I hope we shall all
                        now follow.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence’s hope was not in vain. The conversation soon sprang up everywhere;
                        and the company, though in various humours, took most of them very kindly to
                        the solemn topic that had been put before them. Mr. Luke, who was sitting by
                        Mrs. Sinclair, was heard in a loudish voice saying that his own favourite
                        Muse had always been Erato; Mr. Rose had taken a crimson flower from a vase
                        on the table, and, looking at it himself with a grave regard, was pointing
                        out its infinite and passionate beauties to the lady next him; and Mr.
                        Stockton was explaining that the Alps looked grander, and the sky bluer than
                        ever, to those who truly realised the atomic theory. No one, indeed, was
                        silent except Mr. Herbert and Mr. Storks, the former of whom smiled rather
                        sadly, whilst the latter looked about him with an inquisitorial frown. </p>
                    <p> Laurence was delighted with the state of things, and surveyed the table with
                        great satisfaction. Whilst his attention was thus engaged, Lady Ambrose
                        turned to Leslie, and began asking him if he had been in town much this
                        season. She was taken with his look, and wished to find out if he would
                        really be a nice person to like. </p>
                    <p> ‘Please,’ interposed Laurence pleadingly, ‘do try and keep to the
                        point—please, Lady Ambrose.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I want to find out Mr. Leslie’s aim in life by asking him where he has
                        been,’ she answered. </p>
                    <p> ‘I have been in a great many places,’ said Leslie, ‘but not to pursue any
                        end—only to try and forget that I had no end to pursue.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘This is a very sad state of things,’ said Lady Ambrose; ‘I can always find
                        something to do, except when I am quite alone, or in the country when the
                        house is empty. And even then I can <hi>make</hi> occupation. I draw, or
                        read a book, or teach my little boy some lessons. But come—what do you think
                        is the real aim of life?—since that is what I must ask him, is it not, Mr.
                        Laurence?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Don’t ask me,’ said Leslie; ‘I told you I hadn’t a notion; and I don’t
                        suppose we any of us have.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That can’t be true,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘for just listen how everyone is
                        talking. I wish we could hear what they are saying. You might learn
                        something then, perhaps, Mr. Leslie, since you are so very ignorant.’ </p>
                    <p> It happened that, as Lady Ambrose said this, the conversation suddenly
                        flagged, and Laurence took advantage of the lull to ask if any satisfactory
                        conclusions had been come to during the past five minutes, ‘because we up
                        here,’ he said, ‘are very much in the dark, and want to be enlightened.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Storks gruffly, ‘has any one found out what is the aim of
                        life?’ As he said this he looked about him defiantly, as though all the
                        others were butterflies, that he could break, if he chose, upon his wheel.
                        His eye at last lit upon Mr. Saunders, who, considering this a challenge to
                        himself, immediately took up the gauntlet. The young man spoke with the
                        utmost composure, and, as his voice was high and piercing, everybody could
                        hear him. </p>
                    <p> ‘The aim of life,’ he said, adjusting his spectacles, ‘is progress.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What is progress?’ interrupted Dr. Jenkinson coldly, without looking at Mr.
                        Saunders, and as though any answer to his question was the last thing he
                        expected. </p>
                    <p> ‘Progress,’ replied Mr. Saunders slowly, ‘has been found, like poetry,
                        somewhat hard to define.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Very true,’ said the Doctor drily, and looking straight before him. </p>
                    <p> His accents were of so freezing a sharpness that he seemed to be stabbing
                        Mr. Saunders with an icicle. Mr. Saunders, however, was apparently quite
                        unwounded. </p>
                    <p> ‘But I,’ he continued with the utmost complacency, ‘have discovered a
                        definition which will, I think, meet with general acceptance. There is
                        nothing original in it—it is merely an abstract of the meaning of all our
                        great liberal thinkers—progress is such improvement as can be verified by
                        statistics, just as education is such knowledge as can be tested by
                        examinations. That, I conceive, is a very adequate definition of the most
                        advanced conception of progress, and to persuade people in general to accept
                        this is at present one of the chief duties of all earnest men.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Entirely true!’ said Mr. Herbert, with ironical emphasis; ‘an entirely true
                        definition of progress as our age prizes it.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Saunders was delighted, and, imagining he had made a disciple, he turned
                        to Mr. Herbert and went on. </p>
                    <p> ‘For just let us,’ he said, ‘compare a man with a gorilla, and see in what
                        the man’s superiority lies. It is evidently not in the man’s ideas of God,
                        and so forth—for in his presumable freedom from these the gorilla is the
                        superior of the man—but in the hard and verifiable fact, that the man can
                        build houses and cotton-mills, whereas the highest monkey can scarcely make
                        the rudest approach to a hut.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But can you tell me,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘supposing men some day come to a
                        state in which no more of this progress is possible, what will they do then?
                        ’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Mr. Mill, whom in almost all things I reverence as a supreme authority,’
                        said Mr. Saunders, ‘asked himself that very question. But the answer he gave
                        himself was one of the few things in which I venture to dissent from him.
                        For, when all the greater evils of life shall have been removed, he thinks
                        the human race is to find its chief enjoyment in reading Wordsworth’s
                            poetry.’<note n=" 1"><p>
                                <hi>Vide</hi> J. S. Mill’s Autobiography.</p></note>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed!’ said Mr. Herbert; ‘and did Mill come to any conclusion so sane as
                        that?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I, on the contrary, believe,’ Mr. Saunders went on, ‘that as long as the
                        human race lasts, it will still have some belief in God left in it, and that
                        the eradication of this will afford an unending employment to all
                        enlightened minds.’ </p>
                    <p> Leslie looked at Lady Ambrose, expecting to see her smile. On the contrary
                        she was very grave, and said, ‘I think this is shocking.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence in a soothing tone to her, ‘it is only the way of
                        these young men in times of change like ours. Besides, he is very young—he
                        has only just left Oxford—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘If these irreligious views are to be picked up at Oxford,’ said Lady
                        Ambrose, ‘I shall be obliged to send my little boy, when he grows up, to
                        Cambridge. And as for what you say about “times of change”— I am not a
                        conservative, as you know—indeed, I quite go in for reform, as my husband
                        does: but I don’t think <hi>religion</hi> ought to be dragged into the
                        matter.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘let us listen to what Lord Allen is saying.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘<hi>He</hi> is sure,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘not to say anything but what is
                        nice.’ </p>
                    <p> Allen was speaking in a low tone, but his voice was so clear that Lady
                        Ambrose was quite able to hear him. </p>
                    <p> ‘To me it seems,’ he was saying, blushing a little as he found suddenly how
                        many people were listening to him, ‘that the aim of life has nearly always
                        been plain enough in a certain way—always, and for all men—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed?’ said Mr. Saunders, raising his eyebrows. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Allen, slightly turning towards him, and raising his voice
                        somewhat. ‘It has been, I think, as a single magnet, acting on all, though
                        upon many by repulsion. It is quite indescribable in words. But there are
                        two things by which you can tell a man’s truth to it—a faith in God. and a
                        longing for a future life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Lord Allen,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert, and the sound of his voice made
                        everyone at once a listener, ‘that is very beautifully put! And it is,
                        indeed, quite true, as you say, that the real significance of life must be
                        for ever indescribable in words. But, in the present day, I fear also that
                        for most of us it is not even thinkable in thought. The whole human race,’
                        he went on in measured melancholy accents, ‘is now wandering in an accursed
                        wilderness, which not only shows us no hilltop whence the promised land may
                        be seen, but which, to most of the wanderers, seems a promised land itself.
                        And they have a God of their own too, who engages now to lead them out of it
                        if they will only follow him: who, for visible token of his Godhead, leads
                        them with a pillar of cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night—the cloud
                        being the black smoke of their factory chimneys, and the fire the red glare
                        of their blast-furnaces. And so effectual are these modern divine guides,
                        that if we were standing on the brink of Jordan itself, we should be utterly
                        unable to catch, through the fire and the smoke, one single glimpse of the
                        sunlit hills beyond.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Herbert said these last words almost fiercely; and they were followed by
                        a complete hush. It was almost directly broken by Mr. Rose. </p>
                    <p> ‘To me,’ he said, raising his eyebrows wearily, and sending his words
                        floating down the table in a languid monotone, ‘Mr. Herbert’s whole metaphor
                        seems misleading. I rather look upon life as a chamber, which we decorate as
                        we would decorate the chamber of the woman or the youth that we love,
                        tinting the walls of it with symphonies of subdued colour, and filling it
                        with works of fair form, and with flowers, and with strange scents, and with
                        instruments of music. And this can be done now as well—better, rather —than
                        at any former time: since we know that so many of the old aims were false,
                        and so cease to be distracted by them. We have learned the weariness of
                        creeds; and know that for us the grave has no secrets. We have learned that
                        the aim of life is life; and what does successful life consist in? Simply,’
                        said Mr. Rose, speaking very slowly, and with a soft solemnity, ‘in the
                        consciousness of exquisite living—in the making our own each highest thrill
                        of joy that the moment offers us—be it some touch of colour on the sea or on
                        the mountains, the early dew in the crimson shadows of a rose, the shining
                        of a woman’s limbs in clear water, or—’ </p>
                    <p> Here unfortunately a sound of ‘’Sh’ broke softly from several mouths. Mr.
                        Rose was slightly disconcerted, and a pause that would have been a little
                        awkward seemed imminent. Laurence, to prevent this, did the first thing that
                        occurred to him, and hastily asked Dr. Jenkinson what his view of the matter
                        was. </p>
                    <p> The Doctor’s answer came in his very sharpest voice. </p>
                    <p> ‘Do any of us know what life is?’ he said. ‘Hadn’t we better find that out
                        first?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Life,’ continued Mr. Rose, who had now recovered himself, ‘is a series of
                        moments and emotions.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And a series of absurdities too, very often,’ said Dr. Jenkinson. </p>
                    <p> ‘Life is a solemn mystery,’ said Mr. Storks, severely. </p>
                    <p> ‘Life is a damned nuisance,’ muttered Leslie to himself, but just loud
                        enough to be heard by Lady Ambrose, who smiled at him with a sense of humour
                        that won his heart at once. </p>
                    <p> ‘Life is matter,’ Mr. Storks went on, ‘which, under certain conditions not
                        yet fully understood, has become self-conscious.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Lord Allen has just been saying that it is the preface to eternity,’ said
                        Mr. Saunders. </p>
                    <p> ‘Only, unfortunately,’ said Laurence, ‘it is a preface that we cannot skip,
                        and the dedication is generally made to the wrong person.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘All our doubts on this matter,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘are simply due to that
                        dense pestiferous fog of crazed sentiment that still hides our view, but
                        which the present generation has sternly set its face to dispel and conquer.
                        Science will drain the marshy grounds of the human mind, so that the deadly
                        malaria of Christianity, which has already destroyed two civilisations,
                        shall never be fatal to a third.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I should rather have thought,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, in her soft clear voice,
                        and casting down her eyes thoughtfully, ‘that passion and feeling were the
                        real heart of the matter: and that religion of some sort was an ingredient
                        in all perfect passion. There are seeds of feeling in every soul, but these
                        will never rise up into flowers without some culture—will they, Mr. Luke?
                        And this culture is, surely,’ she said dreamily, ‘the work of Love who is
                        the gardener of the soul, and of Religion, the under-gardener, acting as
                        Love bids it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, yes!’ said Mr. Luke, looking compassionately about him. ‘Culture! Mrs.
                        Sinclair is quite right; for without culture we can never understand
                        Christianity, and Christianity, whatever the vulgar may say of it, is the
                        key to life, and is co-extensive with it.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose was charmed with this sentiment. </p>
                    <p> ‘Quite so, Mr. Luke, I quite agree with you,’ she said, in her most cordial
                        manner. ‘But I wish you would tell me a little more about Culture. I am
                        always so much interested in those things.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Culture,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘is the union of two things—fastidious taste and
                        liberal sympathy. These can only be gained by wide reading guided by sweet
                        reason; and when they are gained, Lady Ambrose, we are conscious, as it
                        were, of a new sense, which at once enables us to discern the Eternal and
                        the absolutely righteous, wherever we find it, whether in an epistle of St.
                        Paul’s or in a comedy of Menander’s. It is true that culture sets aside the
                        larger part of the New Testament as grotesque, barbarous, and immoral; but
                        what remains, purged of its apparent meaning, it discerns to be a treasure
                        beyond all price. And in Christianity—such Christianity, I mean, as true
                        taste can accept—culture sees the guide to the real significance of life,
                        and the explanation,’ Mr. Luke added with a sigh, ‘of that melancholy which
                        in our day is attendant upon all clear sight.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But why,’ said Allen, ‘if you know so well what life’s meaning is, need you
                        feel this melancholy at all? ’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ said Mr. Luke, ‘it is from this very knowledge that the melancholy I
                        speak of springs. We—the cultured—we indeed see. But the world at large does
                        not. It will not listen to us. It thinks we are talking nonsense. Surely
                        that is enough to sadden us. Then, too, our ears are perpetually being
                        pained and deafened by the din of the two opposing Philistinisms—science and
                        orthodoxy—both equally vulgar, and equally useless. But the masses cannot
                        see this. It is impossible to persuade some that science can teach them
                        nothing worth knowing, and others that the dogmatic utterances of the
                        gospels are either ignorant mistakes or oriental metaphors. Don’t you find
                        this, Jenkinson?’ he added, addressing the Doctor across the table in a loud
                        mournful voice. </p>
                    <p> ‘Laurence,’ said the Doctor, apparently not hearing the question, ‘haven’t
                        we talked of this quite long enough? <hi>Town and Country</hi>—let us go on
                        to that; or else we shall be getting very much behind-hand.’ </p>
                    <p> These words of the Doctor’s caused a rapid change in the conversation. And
                        as it appeared impossible to agree as to what the aim of life was, most
                        turned eagerly to the simpler question of where it might be best attained.
                        At first there seemed to be a general sense on all sides that it was a duty
                        to prefer the country. There, the voices of Nature spoke to the soul more
                        freely, the air was purer and fresher; the things in life that were really
                        valuable were more readily taken at their true worth; foolish vanities and
                        trivial cares were less likely to degrade the character; one could have
                        flowers; one could listen to the music of birds and rivers; a country house
                        was more comfortable than a town one; and few prospects were so charming as
                        an English park. But the voice of Mr. Saunders was soon heard proclaiming
                        that progress was almost entirely confined to towns, and that the modern
                        liberal could find little scope for action in the country. ‘If he does
                        anything there,’ Mr. Saunders said, ‘he can only make his tenants more
                        comfortable and contented; and that is simply attaching them more to the
                        existing order of things. Indeed, even now, as matters stand, the healthy
                        rustic, with his fresh complexion and honest eye, is absolutely incapable of
                        appreciating the tyranny of religion and society. But the true liberal is
                        undeceived by his pleasing exterior, and sees a far nobler creature in the
                        pale narrow-chested operative of the city, who at once responds to the
                        faintest cry of insurgence.’ </p>
                    <p> Slight causes often produce large results; and these utterances of Mr.
                        Saunders turned the entire torrent of opinion into a different channel. Mr.
                        Luke, who had a moment before been talking about ‘liberal air,’ and ‘sedged
                        brooks,’ and ‘meadow grass,’ now admitted that one’s country neighbours were
                        sure to be narrow-minded sectarians, and that it was better to live amongst
                        cultured society, even under a London fog, than to look at all the splendour
                        of provincial sunsets, in company with a parson who could talk of nothing
                        but his parishioners and justification by faith. Others, too, followed in
                        the same direction; and the verdict of the majority soon seemed to be that,
                        except in a large country house, country life, though it might be very
                        beautiful, was still very tiresome. But the voice of Mr. Saunders was again
                        heard, during a pause, laying it down that no true liberal could ever care
                        to live in the country now; and Lady Ambrose, who highly disapproved of him
                        and his views in general, saw here a fitting opportunity for contradicting
                        him, asserting that, though she and her husband were both advanced,
                        liberals, yet the pleasantest part of their year was that spent upon their
                        moor in Scotland. ‘And then, too,’ she added, turning to Laurence, ‘I am
                        devoted to our place in Gloucestershire, and I would not miss for anything
                        such things as my new dairy, and my cottages, with the old women in them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And yet,’ said Laurence, smiling, ‘Sir George would never go near the place
                        if it were not for the shooting.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed he would,’ said Lady Ambrose, a little indignantly. ‘He likes the
                        life so much, and is so fond of his gardens, and greenhouses, and—’ </p>
                    <p> But she was here interrupted by Mr. Herbert, who, mistaking the Sir George
                        Ambrose mentioned for another Baronet of the same name—a gentleman of a very
                        old but impoverished Catholic family—broke in as follows, somewhat to the
                        consternation of Lady Ambrose, whose husband was a great cotton-spinner, of
                        the most uncertain origin. </p>
                    <p> ‘Sir George,’ he said, ‘is, as I know well, an entirely honest gentleman of
                        ancient lineage. He is indeed a perfectly beautiful type of what the English
                        Squire properly ought to be. For he lives upon his own land, and amongst his
                        own people; and is a complete and lovely example to them of a life quite
                        simple indeed, but in the highest sense loyal, noble, and orderly. But what
                        is one amongst so many? To most of his own order Sir George Ambrose appears
                        merely as a madman, because he sees that it is altogether a nobler thing for
                        a man to be brave and chivalrous than it is to be fashionable; and because
                        he looks forward on his dying day to remembering the human souls that he has
                        saved alive, rather than the pheasants that he has shot dead.’ </p>
                    <p> Now, the husband of Lady Ambrose being known to most present for his
                        magnificent new country house, his immense preserves, and his yacht of four
                        hundred tons that never went out of the Solent, there was naturally some
                        wonder excited by Mr. Herbert’s words, since the thought of any other Sir
                        George never came for an instant into anyone’s head. Lady Ambrose herself
                        was in utter amazement. She could not tell what to make of it, and she was
                        as near looking confused as she had ever been in her life. The awkwardness
                        of the situation was felt by many: and to cover it a hum of conversation
                        sprang up, with forced alacrity. But this did not make matters much better;
                        for in a very short time Mr. Herbert’s voice was again audible, uttering
                        words of no measured denunciation against the great land-owners of England,
                        ‘who were once,’ he said, ‘in some true sense a Nobility, but are now the
                        portentousest Ignobility that the world ever set eyes upon.’ Everyone felt
                        that this was approaching dangerous ground: nor were they at all reassured
                        when Mr. Herbert, who was, it appeared, quoting from a letter which he had
                        received, he said, that morning from the greatest of modern thinkers,
                        concluded amidst a complete silence with the following passage, <hi>‘Yes,
                            here they come, with coats of the newest fashion, with pedigrees of the
                            newest forging, with their moors in Scotland, with their rivers in
                            Norway, with their game preserves in England, with some thousands of
                            human beings calling them masters, somewhere—they probably forget
                            where—and with the mind of a thinking man, or with the heart of a
                            gentleman, nowhere. Here they come, our cotton-spinning plutocrats,
                            bringing in luxury, and vulgarity, and damnation!’</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> These last words came like a thunderclap. Laurence hardly knew where to
                        look. The result, however, was more satisfactory than could have been
                        expected. There are some emotions, as we all know, that can be calmed best
                        by tears. Lady Ambrose did not cry. She did something better—she laughed. </p>
                    <p> ‘What would poor Sir George say?’ she whispered to Laurence. ‘He is fishing
                        in Norway at this very moment. But do you really think,’ she went on, being
                        resolved not to shirk the subject, ‘that Society is really as bad as Mr.
                        Herbert says? I was looking into the <note n="Comte de Grammont’s Memoirs"/>
                        the other day, and I am sure nothing goes on in London now so bad as what he
                        describes.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you know, Lady Ambrose,’ said Mr. Herbert, who concluded that he had
                        given her much pleasure by his late remarks, ‘I think the state of London at
                        the present day infinitely worse than anything Grammont or his biographer
                        could have dreamt of.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Quite so,’ said Mr. Luke; ‘the bulk of men in our days are just as immoral
                        as they were in Charles the Second’s; the only difference is that they are
                        incomparably more stupid; and that, instead of decking their immorality with
                        the jewels of wit, they clumsily try to cover it with the tarpaulin of
                        respectability. This has not made the immorality any the better; it has only
                        made respectability the most contemptible word in the English language.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The fop of Charles’s time,’ said Leslie, ‘aimed at seeming a wit and a
                        scholar. The fop of ours aims at being a fool and a dunce.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘society was diseased then, it is true, and marks
                        of disease disfigured and scarred its features. Still, in spite of this, it
                        had some sound life left in it. But now the entire organism is dissolving
                        and falling asunder. All the parts are refusing to perform their functions.
                        How, indeed, could this possibly be otherwise, when the head itself, the
                        aristocracy, the part whose special office is to see and think, has now lost
                        completely both its brains and eyes, and has nothing head-like left it
                        except the mouth; and that cannot so much as speak. It can only eat and
                        yawn.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Society, you see, Mr. Herbert,’ said Lady Ambrose, who felt bound to say
                        something, ‘is so much larger now than it was.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh,’ said Laurence, shrugging his shoulders, ‘in that sense, I really think
                        there is almost no society now.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t see how there can be,’ said Miss Merton, ‘when what is called
                        society is simply one great scramble after fashion. And fashion is such a
                        delicate fruit, that it is sure to be spoilt if it is scrambled for.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I am glad,’ said Laurence, ‘you don’t abuse fashion as some people do. I
                        look on it as the complexion of good society, and as the rouge of bad; and
                        when society gets sickly and loses its complexion, it takes to rouge—as it
                        is doing now; and the rouge eats into its whole system, and makes its health
                        worse than ever.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You are the last person, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘you who go out
                        so much, that I should have expected to hear talking against society like
                        that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ said Laurence, ‘we cannot escape from our circumstances: I only wish
                        we could. I go into the best society I can get, but I am not blind to the
                        fact that it is very bad. Of course there are a number of the most
                        delightful people in it: I am not denying that for a moment. But not only is
                        society not made up out of a few of its parts, but even the best parts
                        suffer from the tone of the whole. And taking society as a whole, I honestly
                        doubt if it was ever at any time so generally bad as it is now. I am not
                        saying that it has forgotten its duties—that it cannot even conceive that it
                        ever had any; that is of course quite true: but Mr. Herbert has said that
                        already. I am not complaining of its moral badness, but of its social
                        badness—of its want of practical skill in life as a fine art—a want that it
                        often feels itself, and yet has not the skill to remedy. Think for a moment
                        how barbarous are its amusements; how little culture there is in its general
                        tone; how incapable it is of any enlightened interest!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘I think you are doing society a great
                        injustice. It seems to me that enlightened interest is the very thing that
                        is everywhere on the spread. The light of intellect is emerging from the
                        laboratory and the dissecting-room, where it had its birth, and is gilding,
                        with its clear rays, the dinner-table, and even the ball-room. A freer, a
                        truer, and a grander view of things, seems to me to be rapidly dawning on
                        the world.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I fear, my dear sir,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘that these pleasing opinions of yours
                        will not bear testing.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you mean,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘that society as a rule is not infinitely
                        better informed now than it was thirty years ago? Has it not infinitely
                        fewer prejudices and infinitely more knowledge?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘We should look to the effects of the knowledge, not to the knowledge
                        itself,’ said Mr. Luke. ‘We cannot test the health of a society from looking
                        over its examination papers in physical science.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘How would you test it?’ said Mr. Stockton, with a slight curl of the lip. </p>
                    <p> ‘There are many tests,’ said Mr. Luke. ‘Here is one, amongst the very
                        subjects that Mr. Laurence has ordered us to talk about—art and literature.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I accept the test,’ said Mr. Stockton. ‘What, then, can be nobler than much
                        modern poetry? There is some that I look upon as quite of the highest
                        order.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘When I spoke of our literature,’ said Mr. Luke loftily, ‘I was not thinking
                        of poetry. We have no poetry now.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed?’ said Mr. Stockton; ‘I imagined you had written some yourself.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, drawing a long sigh, ‘I once knew what Goethe
                        calls “the divine worth of tone and tears.” But my own poems only prove the
                        truth of what I say. They could only have been written in evil days. They
                        were simply a wail of pain; and now that I am grown braver, I keep silence.
                        Poetry in some ages is an expression of the best strength; in an age like
                        ours it is the disguise of the worst weakness—or, when not that, it is
                        simply a forced plant, an exotic. No, Mr. Stockton, I was not speaking of
                        our poetry, but of the one kind of imaginative literature that is the
                        natural growth of our own day, the novel. Now, the novel itself is a plant
                        which, when it grows abundantly and alone, you may be sure is a sign of a
                        poor soil. But don’t trust to that only. Look at our novels themselves, and
                        see what sort of life it is they image—the trivial interests, the
                        contemptible incidents, the absurdity of the virtuous characters, the
                        viciousness of the characters who are not absurd. Spain was in some ways
                        worse in Cervantes’ time than England is in ours; but you may search all our
                        novels for one character that has one tithe of Don Quixote’s heroism, for
                        one of our sane men that breathed in so healthy and pure an atmosphere as
                        the inspired madman. And this is not from want of ability on the novelist’s
                        part. Some of them have powers enough and to spare; but the best novels only
                        reflect back most clearly the social anarchy, and the bad ones are
                        unconscious parts of it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And as for our painting,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘that reflects, even more
                        clearly than our literature, our hideous and our hopeless degradation. The
                        other day, when I walked through the Royal Academy, my mind was literally
                        dazzled by the infernal glare of corruption and vulgarity that was flashed
                        upon me from every side. There were, indeed, only two pictures in the whole
                        collection that were not entirely abominable; and these were, one of them
                        three boulders in the island of Sark, the other a study of pebbles on the
                        beach at Ilfracombe.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I know little about the technicalities of art,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘so I
                        will not presume to dispute this point with you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Leslie, ‘here is another test quite as good as art and
                        literature—love and money, and their relations in our days.’ </p>
                    <p> He would have continued speaking; but Mr. Herbert allowed him no time. </p>
                    <p> ‘The very things,’ he said, ‘I was about to touch upon—the very things the
                        pictures the other day suggested to me. For, seeing how the work of the
                        painter becomes essentially vile so soon as it becomes essentially venal, I
                        was reminded of the like corruption of what is far more precious than the
                        work of any painter—our own English girls, who are prepared for the modern
                        marriage-market on precisely the same principles as our pictures for the
                        Royal Academy. There is but one difference. The work of the modern painter
                        is vile from its very beginning—in its conception and execution alike; but
                        our girls we receive, in the first instance, entirely fair and sacred from
                        the hands of God himself, clothed upon with a lovelier vesture than any
                        lilies of the field—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really,’ whispered Lady Ambrose to Laurence, ‘Providence has done so very
                        little for us, as far as vesture goes.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘—And we,’ Mr. Herbert went on, ‘with unspeakable profanity presume to dress
                        and to decorate them, till the heavenly vesture is entirely hidden,
                        thinking, like a modern Simon Magus, that the gifts of God are to be
                        purchased for money, and not caring to perceive that, if they are to be
                        purchased with the devil’s money, we must first convert them into the
                        devil’s gifts.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, with a faint smile, ‘the day for love-matches is
                        quite gone over now.’ </p>
                    <p> But her words were drowned by Mr. Saunders, who exclaimed at the top of his
                        voice, and in a state of great excitement, ‘Electric
                        telegraphs—railways—steam printing presses—let me beg of you to consider the
                        very next subject set for us—riches and civilisation—and to judge of the
                        present generation by the light of that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I have considered them,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘for the last thirty years—and
                        with inexpressible melancholy.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I conceive,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘that you are somewhat singular in your
                        feelings.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I am,’ replied Mr. Herbert; ‘and that in most of my opinions and feelings I
                        am singular, is a fact fraught for me with the most ominous significance.
                        Yet, how could I—who think that health is more than wealth, and who hold it
                        a more important thing to separate right from wrong than to identify men
                        with monkeys—how could I hope to be anything but singular in a generation
                        that deliberately, and with its eyes open, prefers a cotton-mill to a
                        Titian?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I hold it,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘to be one of the great triumphs of our day,
                        that it has so subordinated all the vaguer and more lawless sentiments to
                        the solid guidance of sober economical considerations. And not only do I
                        consider a cotton-mill, but I consider even a good sewer, to be a far nobler
                        and a far holier thing—for holy in reality does but mean healthy—than the
                        most admired Madonna ever painted.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘A good sewer,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘is, I admit, an entirely holy thing; and
                        would all our manufacturers and men of science bury themselves underground,
                        and confine their attention to making sewers, I, for one, should have little
                        complaint against them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And are railways, telegraphs, gas-lamps—is the projected Channel tunnel,
                        nothing in your eyes? Is it nothing that all the conditions of life are
                        ameliorated, that mind is daily pursuing farther its conquest over matter?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Have we much to thank you for,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘that you have saved us
                        from an hour of sea-sickness, if in return you give us a whole lifetime of
                        heart-sickness? Your mind, my good sir, that you boast of, is so occupied in
                        subduing matter, that it is entirely forgetful of subduing itself—a matter,
                        trust me, that is far more important. And as for your amelioration of the
                        conditions of life—that is not civilisation which saves a man from the need
                        of exercising any of his powers, but which obliges him to exert his noble
                        powers; not that which satisfies his lower feelings with the greatest ease,
                        but which provides satisfaction for his higher feelings, no matter at what
                        trouble.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Other things being equal,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘I apprehend that the
                        generation that travels sixty miles an hour is at least five times as
                        civilised as the generation that travels only twelve.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But the other things are not equal,’ said Mr. Herbert: ‘and the other
                        things, by which I suppose you mean all that is really sacred in the life of
                        man, have been banished or buried by the very things which we boast of as
                        our civilisation.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That is our own fault,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘not the fault of civilisation.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Not so,’ said Mr. Herbert. ‘Bring up a boy to do nothing for himself—make
                        everything easy for him—to use your own expression, subdue matter for
                        him—and that boy will never be able to subdue anything for himself. He will
                        be weak in body, and a coward in soul—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Precisely,’ said Mr. Saunders. ‘And that is really, if you look
                        dispassionately at the matter, a consummation devoutly to be wished. For why
                        do we need our bodies to be strong?—To overcome obstacles. Why do we need to
                        be brave?—To attack enemies. But by and by, when all our work is done by
                        machinery, and we have no longer any obstacles to overcome, or any hardships
                        to endure, strength will become useless, and bravery dangerous. And my own
                        hope is that both will have ere long vanished; and that weakness and
                        cowardice, qualities which we now so irrationally despise, will have
                        vindicated their real value, by turning universal civilisation into
                        universal peace.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘that is exactly what the modern world is longing
                        for—a universal peace; which never can nor will mean anything else than
                        peace with the devil.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really,’ said Lady Ambrose to Leslie, ‘do you think we are in such a bad
                        way as all this? Dr. Jenkinson, I must ask you—you always know these
                        things—do you think we are so very bad?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes—yes,’ said the Doctor, turning towards her with a cheerful smile,
                        ‘there is a great deal that is very bad in our own days— very bad indeed.
                        Many thoughtful people think that there is more that is bad in the present
                        than there has ever been in the past. Many thoughtful people in all days
                        have thought the same.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Whenever wise men,’ said Herbert, ‘have taken to thinking about their own
                        times, it is quite true that they have always thought ill of them. But that
                        is because the times must have gone wrong before the wise men take to the
                        business of thinking about them at all. We are never conscious of our
                        constitutions till they are out of order.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah! yes,’ said Mr. Luke; ‘how true that is, Herbert! Philosophy may be a
                        golden thing. But it is the gold of the autumn woods, that soon falls, and
                        leaves the boughs of the nation naked.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Leslie, ‘leaving nothing but <quote> Bare ruined choirs, where
                            late the sweet birds sang.’ </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘Thank you, Mr. Leslie,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert across the table, ‘thank
                        you—an exquisitely apt quotation.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Then you, Mr. Leslie,’ said Lady Ambrose in a disappointed voice, ‘you are
                        one of these desponding people too, are you? I never heard anything so
                        dismal in my life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I certainly think,’ said Leslie, ‘that our age in some ways could not
                        possibly be worse. Nobody knows what to believe, and most people believe
                        nothing. Don’t you find that?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed I do not,’ said Lady Ambrose, with some vigour, ‘and I am very sorry
                        for those who do. That Mr. Saunders,’ she added, lowering her voice, ‘is the
                        first person I ever heard express such views. We were dining only the other
                        day with the Bishop of ——, and I’ll tell you what he said, Mr. Leslie. He
                        said that the average number of churches built yearly during the last ten
                        years was greater than it had ever been since the Reformation. That does not
                        look as if religion was on the decline, does it? I know the Bishop spoke of
                        a phase of infidelity that was passing over the nation: but that, he said,
                        would soon have drifted by. Indeed, he told us that all the teachings of
                        modern irreligious science were simply reproductions of—you must not laugh
                        at me if I say the names wrong—Epicurus and Democritus—which had been long
                        ago refuted. And that was no peculiar crotchet of his own mind; for a very
                        clever gentleman who was sitting next me said that that was the very thing
                        which all the bishops agreed in saying—almost the only thing indeed in which
                        they did agree.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ said Leslie, ‘materialism once came to the world like a small street
                        boy throwing mud at it; and the indignant world very soon drove it away. But
                        it has now come back again, dirtier than ever, bringing a big brother with
                        it, and Heaven knows when we shall get rid of it now.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘In every state of transition,’ said Dr. Jenkinson to Miss Merton, ‘there
                        must always be much uneasiness. But I don’t think,’ he said, with a little
                        pleased laugh, ‘that you will find these times really much worse than those
                        that went before them. No—no. If we look at them soberly, they are really a
                        great deal better. We have already got rid of a vast amount of superstition
                        and ignorance, and are learning what Christianity really is. We are learning
                        true reverence—that is, not to dogmatise about subjects of which we cannot
                        possibly know anything.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Just so, Jenkinson,’ said Mr. Luke;’ that is the very thing I am trying to
                        teach the world myself. Personal immortality, for instance, which forms no
                        part of the sweet secret of authentic Christianity—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes—yes,’ said the Doctor hastily; ‘the Church had degraded the doctrine.
                        It needed to be expressed anew.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course,’ said Miss Merton, ‘I, as a Catholic—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Dear! dear!’ exclaimed the Doctor, in some confusion, ‘I beg your pardon. I
                        had no notion you were a Roman Catholic.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I was going to say,’ Miss Merton went on, ‘that, though of course as a
                        Catholic I am not without what I believe to be an infallible guide, I feel
                        just as much as anyone the bad state in which things are now. It is so
                        difficult to shape one’s course in life. One has nowhere any work cut out
                        for one. There is a want of—well—’ she said, smiling, ‘of what perhaps, when
                        religion has been analysed by science, will be called moral ozone in the
                        air.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Such a feeling is not unnatural,’ said the Doctor; ‘but you will find it
                        vanish if you just resolve cheerfully to go on doing the duty next you—even
                        if this be only to order dinner. And,’ he said, turning to her rather
                        abruptly, ‘don’t despond over the times: that only makes them worse.
                        Besides, they are not really at all bad. There is no need for desponding at
                        all.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But there is at least excuse,’ said Laurence, ‘when we see all the old
                        faiths, the old ideas, under which the world has so long found shelter,
                        fading <quote>Like the baseless fabric of a vision,</quote> rapidly and for
                        ever away from us.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t think so,’ said the Doctor, as if that settled the question. </p>
                    <p> ‘Christianity,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘is only retiring to make way for
                        something better. Religions are not quickened unless they perish. Look
                        forward at the growing brightness of the future, not at the faded brightness
                        of the past.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Why not look at the present?’ said Dr. Jenkinson. ‘Depend upon it, it is
                        not wise to be above one’s times. There’s plenty of religion now. The real
                        power of Christianity is growing every day, even where you least expect it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘In what part of Christianity,’ said Leslie, ‘its real power lies, it would
                        be unbecoming in me to profess that I know. But this I do know, that if you
                        take four out of five of the more thoughtful and instructed men of the day,
                        you will find that not only have they no faith in a personal God or a
                        personal immortality, but the very notions of such things seem to them
                        absurdities.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘it was once thought a characteristic of the lowest
                        savages to be without a belief in a future life. It will soon be thought a
                        characteristic of the lowest savages to be with one.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really now—’ said Mr. Luke, in a voice whose tone seemed to beseech
                        everyone to be sensible, ‘personal immortality and a personal Deity are no
                        doctrines of Christianity. You, Jenkinson, I know agree with me.’ </p>
                    <p> There was nothing the Doctor so disliked as these appeals from Mr. Luke. He
                        made in this case no response whatever. He turned instead to Miss Merton. </p>
                    <p> ‘You see,’ he said to her in a very quiet but very judicial way, ‘the age we
                        live in is an age of change. And in all such ages there must be many things
                        that, if we let them, will pain and puzzle us. But we mustn’t let them.
                        There have been many ages of change before our time, and there are sure to
                        be many after it. Our age is not peculiar.’ </p>
                    <p> Here he paused, as he had a way of doing at times between his sentences.
                        This practice now, as it had often been before, was of a disservice to him;
                        for it gave a fatal facility for interruption when he could least have
                        wished it. In this case Leslie entirely put him out, by attacking the very
                        statement which the Doctor least of all had designed to bear question. </p>
                    <p> ‘But in some ways,’ said Leslie, ‘this age is peculiar, surely. It is
                        peculiar in the extraordinary rapidity of its changes. Christianity took
                        three hundred years to supplant polytheism; atheism has hardly taken thirty
                        to supplant Christianity.’ Dr. Jenkinson did not deign to take the least
                        notice of this. </p>
                    <p> ‘I suppose,’ said Miss Merton to Leslie, ‘that you think Catholicism quite a
                        thing of the past?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I’m afraid,’ said Leslie, ‘that my opinion on that is of very small
                        importance. But, however that may be, you must admit that in the views of
                        the world at large there have been great changes; and these, I say, have
                        come on us with so astonishing a quickness that they have plunged us into a
                        state of mental anarchy that has not been equalled since mental order has
                        been known. There is no recognised rule of life any where. The old rules
                        only satisfy those who are not capable of feeling the need of any rule at
                        all. Every one who does right at all only does what is right in his own
                        eyes. All society, it seems, is going to pieces.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘look upon social dissolution as the true condition of
                        the most perfect life. For the centre of life is the individual, and it is
                        only through dissolution that the individual can re-emerge. All the warrings
                        of endless doubts, all the questionings of matter and of spirit, which I
                        have myself known, I value only because, remembering the weariness of them,
                        I take a profounder and more exquisite pleasure in the colour of a crocus,
                        the pulsations of a chord of music, or a picture of Sandro Botticelli’s.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose’s words hardly produced all the effect he could have wished; for
                        the last part was almost drowned in the general rustle of the ladies rising. </p>
                    <p> ‘Before we go, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘will you be good enough to
                        tell me the history of these salt-cellars? I wanted to have asked you at the
                        beginning of dinner, but you made yourself so very appalling then, that I
                        really did not venture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘no doubt they surprise you. They were a present made
                        to me the other day by a friend of mine—an eminent man of science, and are
                        models of a peculiar kind of retort he has invented, for burning human
                        bodies, and turning them into gas.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Good gracious!’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘how horrible! I insist, Mr. Laurence,
                        on your having another set to-morrow night—remember.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘There,’ said Laurence, when the gentlemen had resettled themselves, and had
                        begun their wine, ‘there is the new version of the skeleton at the
                        banquet-board—the two handfuls of white dust, to which we, the salt of the
                        earth, shall one day crumble. Let us sacrifice all the bulls we have to
                            <hi>Pluto illacrimabilis</hi>—let us sacrifice ourselves to one another,
                        or to Heaven—to this favour must we come. Is not that so, Mr. Storks?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Laurence,’ said Dr. Jenkinson briskly, ‘the conversation hasn’t kept pace
                        with the dinner. We have got no farther than “The Present” yet. The ladies
                        are going to talk of “The Future” by themselves. See— there they are out on
                        the terrace.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Storks here drew his chair to the table, and cleared his throat. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is easier,’ he said, ‘to talk about the present now we are alone—now
                            <hi>they</hi>,’ he nodded his head in the direction of the party
                        outside, ‘are gone out to talk about the future in the moonlight. There are
                        many things which even yet it does not do to say before women—at least,
                        before all women.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘My aunt,’ said Laurence, ‘is a great authority on woman’s education and
                        true position; and she has written an essay to advance the female cause.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed?’ said Mr. Storks; ‘I was not aware of that. I shall look forward
                        with much pleasure to some conversation with her. But what I was going to
                        say related to the present, which at dinner was on all sides so mercilessly
                        run down. I was going to claim for the present age, in thought and
                        speculation (and it is these that give their tone to its entire conduct of
                        life), as its noble and peculiar feature, a universal, intrepid, dogged
                        resolve to find out and face the complete truth of things, and to allow no
                        prejudice, however dear to us, to obscure our vision. This is the only real
                        morality: and not only is it full of blessing for the future, but it is
                        giving us “manifold more in this present time” as well. The work of science,
                        you see, is twofold; it enlarges the horizon of the mind, and improves the
                        conditions of the body. If you will pardon my saying so, Mr. Herbert, I
                        think your antipathy to science must be clue to your not having fully
                        appreciated its true work and dignity.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The work of science is, I know, twofold,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘speculative
                        and practical.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Exactly so,’ said Mr. Storks approvingly. </p>
                    <p> ‘And all it can do for us in speculation,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘is to teach us
                        that we have no life hereafter: all it can do for us in practice, is to ruin
                        our life here. It enervates us by providing us with base luxury; it degrades
                        us by turning our attention to base knowledge.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘No—no,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, with one of his little laughs, ‘not that. I
                        don’t think, Mr. Storks, that Mr. Herbert always quite means what he says.
                        We mustn’t take him at his word.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear sir,’ said Mr. Herbert, turning to the Doctor, ‘you are a
                        consecrated priest of the mystical Church of Christ’—Dr. Jenkinson winced
                        terribly at this—‘and let me ask you if you think it the work of Christ to
                        bring into men’s minds eternal corruption, instead of eternal life—or,
                        rather, not corruption, I should say, but putrefaction. For what is
                        putrefaction but decomposition? And at the touch of science all our noblest
                        ideas decompose and putrefy, till our whole souls are strewn with dead hopes
                        and dead religions, with corpses of all the thoughts we loved <quote>
                            Quickening slowly into lower forms. </quote> You may call it analysis,
                        but I call it death.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I wish we could persuade you,’ said Mr. Stockton, very temperately, ‘to
                        take a fairer view of things. Surely truth cannot in the long run be
                        anything but life-giving.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Let us take care of facts,’ said Mr. Storks, ‘and fictions—I beg your
                        pardon, religion—will take care of itself.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And religion,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘will take care of itself very well. Of
                        course we don’t waste time now in thinking about personal immortality. We
                        shall not live; but the mind of man will; and religion will live too, being
                        part of the mind of man. Religion is, indeed, to the inner world what the
                        sky is to the outer. It is the mind’s canopy—the infinite mental azure in
                        which the mysterious source of our being is at once revealed and hidden. Let
                        us beware, then, of not considering religion noble; but let us beware still
                        more of considering it true. We may fancy that we trace in the clouds shapes
                        of real things; and, as long as we know that this is only fancy, I know of
                        no holier occupation for the human mind than such cloud-gazing. But let us
                        always recollect that the cloud which to us may seem shaped like a son of
                        man, may seem to another to be backed like a weasel, and to another to be
                        very like a whale. What, then,’ Mr. Stockton added, ‘can be a nobler study
                        than the great book of Nature, or, as we used to call it, the works of God?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Pray do not think,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘that I complain of this generation
                        because it studies Nature. I complain of it because it does not study her.
                        Yes,’ he went on, as he saw Mr. Stockton start, ‘you can analyse her in your
                        test tubes, you can spy at her through your microscopes; but can you see her
                        with your own eyes, or receive her into your own souls? You can tell us what
                        she makes her wonders of, and how she makes them, and how long she takes
                        about it. But you cannot tell us what these wonders are like when they are
                        made. When God said, “Let there be light, and light was, and God saw that it
                        was good,” was he thinking, as he saw this, of the exact velocity it
                        travelled at, and of the exact laws it travelled by, which you wise men are
                        at such infinite pains to discover; or was he thinking of something else,
                        which you take no pains to discover at all—of how it clothed the wings of
                        the morning with silver, and the feathers of the evening with gold? Is
                        water, think you, a nobler thing to the modern chemist, who can tell you
                        exactly what gases it is made of, and nothing more; or to Turner, who could
                        not tell you at all what it is made of, but who did know and who could tell
                        you what it is made—what it is made by the sunshine, and the cloud-shadow,
                        and the storm-wind—who knew how it paused in the taintless mountain
                        trout-pool, a living crystal over stones of flickering amber; and how it
                        broke itself turbid, with its choirs of turbulent thunder, when the rocks
                        card it into foam, and where the tempest sifts it into spray? When Pindar
                        called water the best of things, was he thinking of it as the union of
                        oxygen and hydrogen—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘He would have been much wiser if he had been,’ interposed Dr. Jenkinson.
                        ‘Thales, to whose theory, as you know, Pindar was referring—’ But the
                        Doctor’s words were utterly unavailing to check the torrent of Mr. Herbert’s
                        eloquence. They only turned it into a slightly different course. </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah! masters of modern science,’ he went on, ‘you can tell us what pure
                        water is made of; but, thanks to your drains and your mills, you cannot tell
                        us where to find it. You can, no doubt, explain to us all about sunsets; but
                        the smoke of your towns and your factories has made it impossible for us to
                        see one. However, each generation is wise in its own wisdom; and ours would
                        sooner look at a fœtus in a bottle, than at a statue of the god Apollo, from
                        the hand of Phidias, and in the air of Athens.’ </p>
                    <p> During all this speech Mr. Storks had remained with his face buried in his
                        hands, every now and then drawing in his breath through his teeth, as if he
                        were in pain. When it was over he looked up with a scared expression, as if
                        he hardly knew where he was, and seemed quite unable to utter a syllable. </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘mere science, as science, does not deal
                        with moral right and wrong.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘for it has shown that right and wrong are terms of
                        a bygone age, connoting altogether false ideas. Mere automata as science
                        shows we are—clockwork machines, wound up by meat and drink—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘As for that,’ broke in Mr. Storks, who had by this time recovered
                        himself—and his weighty voice at once silenced Mr. Saunders, ‘I would advise
                        our young friend not to be too confident. We may be automata, or we may not.
                        Science has not yet decided. And upon my word,’ he said, striking the table,
                        ‘I don’t myself care which we are. Supposing the Deity—if there be
                        one—should offer to make me a machine, if I am not one, on condition that I
                        should always go right, I, for one, would gladly close with the proposal.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But you forget,’ said Allen, ‘that in the moral sense there would be no
                        going right at all, if there were not also the possibility of going wrong.
                        If your watch keeps good time you don’t call it virtuous, nor if it keeps
                        bad time do you call it sinful.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Sin, Lord Allen,’ said Mr. Storks, ‘is a word that has helped to retard
                        moral and social progress more than anything. Nothing is good or bad, but
                        thinking makes it so; and the superstitious and morbid way in which a number
                        of entirely innocent things have been banned as sin, has caused more than
                        half the tragedies of the world. Science will establish an entirely new
                        basis of morality; and the sunlight of rational approbation will shine on
                        many a thing, hitherto overshadowed by the curse of a hypothetical God.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Exactly so,’ exclaimed Mr. Saunders eagerly. ‘Now, I’m not at all that sort
                        of man myself,’ he went on, ‘so don’t think it because I say this.’ </p>
                    <p> Everyone stared at Mr. Saunders in wonder as to what he could mean. </p>
                    <p> ‘We think it, for instance,’ he said, ‘a very sad thing when a girl is as we
                        call it ruined. But it is we really that make all the sadness. She is ruined
                        only because we think she is so. And I have little doubt that that higher
                        philosophy of the future that Mr. Storks speaks of will go far, some day,
                        towards solving the great question of women’s sphere of action, by its
                        recognition of prostitution as an honourable and beneficent profession.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Sir!’ exclaimed Mr. Storks, striking the table, and glaring with
                        indignation at Mr. Saunders, ‘I could hardly have believed that such
                        misplaced flippancy—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Flippancy! it is reasoned truth,’ shrieked Mr. Saunders, upsetting his
                        wine-glass. Luckily this brought about a pause. Laurence took advantage of
                        it. </p>
                    <p> ‘See,’ he said, ‘Dr. Jenkinson has left us. Will no one have any more
                        wine?—Then suppose we follow him.’ </p>

                    <p> IT was a calm, lovely evening. The moon was rising over the sea, and the sea
                        was slowly silvering under it. A soft breeze breathed gently, full of the
                        scents of flowers; and in the low sky of the west there yet lingered a
                        tender peach-colour. </p>
                    <p> The ladies were sitting about on chairs, grouped together, but with several
                        little groups within the group; and amongst them all was Dr. Jenkinson,
                        making himself particularly agreeable to Mrs. Sinclair. When the gentlemen
                        emerged there was a general stir, and Lady Ambrose, shutting up a volume of
                        St.-Simon’s Memoirs, said, ‘Well, Mr. Laurence, we have been talking most
                        industriously about the future.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence was standing with Mr. Luke on the step of the dining-room window,
                        and both were looking out gravely on the tranquil scene. </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you remember,’ said Laurence, ‘that it was here, three years ago, that
                        you composed the lines that stand last in your published volumes?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I remember,’ said Mr. Luke dreamily. ‘What an evening that was!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I wish you would repeat them,’ said Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘What is the good?’ said Mr. Luke; ‘why rouse again the voices that haunt
                            <quote> About the mouldered lodges of the past?’ </quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘Mr. Luke,’ said Lady Ambrose appealingly, ‘I do so wish you would.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Is Mr. Luke going to recite poetry?’ said Mrs. Sinclair, coming languidly
                        up to them. ‘How delicious!’ She was looking lovely in the dim light, with a
                        diamond star shining in her dark hair; and for a mortal bard there was
                        positively no resisting her appeal. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke, with a silent composure, pressed his hands for a moment against
                        his forehead; he gave one hem; and then in a clear melodious voice began as
                        follows:— </p>

                    <p> ‘Thank you, Mr. Luke, so much,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘How charming! I am
                        always so fond of poems about the sea.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Luke, turning to Mrs. Sinclair, ‘these are emotions scarcely
                        worth describing.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Certainly not,’ muttered Mr. Storks, half aloud as he moved off to discover
                        Lady Grace. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke stood apart, and surveyed the party with a look of pensive pity. On
                        Mr. Storks, however, whose last remark he had overheard, his eyes rested
                        with an expression somewhat more contemptuous. The brightening moonlight
                        fell softly on the group before him, giving it a particularly picturesque
                        effect, as it touched the many colours and folds of the ladies’ dresses, and
                        struck here and there a furtive flash from a gem on wrist or throat. The
                        tranquil hour seemed to have a tranquillising effect on nearly everyone; and
                        the conversation reached Mr. Luke’s ears as a low murmur, broken only by the
                        deep sound of Mr. Storks’s voice, and the occasional high notes of Mr.
                        Saunders, who seemed to Mr. Luke, in his present frame of mind, to be like a
                        shrill cock crowing to the world before the sunrise of universal
                        philistinism. </p>
                    <p> Laurence meanwhile had caught Miss Merton’s eyes looking at him with a grave
                        regard; and this had brought him instantly to her side, when Mr. Luke had
                        ended his recital. </p>
                    <p> ‘We didn’t spare the times we live in, to-night, did we?’ he said slowly to
                        her in a low voice. ‘Well, well—I wonder what it is all coming to—we and our
                        times together! We are certainly a curious medley here, all of us. I suppose
                        no age but ours could have produced one like it—at least, let us hope so,
                        for the credit of the ages in general.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I must say,’ said Miss Merton, smiling, ‘that you seem to take to the age
                        very kindly, and to be very happy amongst your friends. But you did not tell
                        us very much of what you thought yourself.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t often say what I think,’ said Laurence, ‘because I don’t often know
                        what I think; but I know a great many things that I don’t think; and I
                        confess I take a pleasure in saying these, and in hearing others say them;
                        so the society that I choose as a rule represents not the things I think I
                        approve, but the things I am sure I repudiate.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I confess,’ said Miss Merton, ‘I don’t quite understand that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Shall I tell you,’ said Laurence, ‘why I live so much in society—amongst my
                        friends, as you call them? Simply because I feel, in my life, as a child
                        does in a dark room; and I must have some one to talk to, or else I think I
                        should go mad. What one says is little matter, so long as one makes a noise
                        of some sort, and forgets the ghosts that in one’s heart one is shuddering
                        at.’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton was silent for a moment, and looked up into the sky in which the
                        stars were now one by one appearing. </p>
                    <p> ‘I suppose,’ she said presently, ‘you think it is a very poor affair—life’s
                        whole business. And yet I don’t see why you should.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Not see why I should?’ repeated Laurence. ‘Ah, that shows how little you,
                        from your position, can sympathise with ours. I am not surprised at it. Of
                        course, it is out of the question that you should. You, happy in some
                        sustaining faith, can see a meaning in all life, and all life’s affections.
                        You can endure—you can even welcome its sorrows. The clouds of
                            <hi>ennui</hi> themselves for you have silver linings. For your religion
                        is a kind of philosopher’s stone, turning whatever it touches into something
                        precious. But we—we can only remember that for us, too, things had a meaning
                        once; but they have it no longer. Life stares at us now, all blank and
                        expressionless, like the eyes of a lost friend, who is not dead, but who has
                        turned an idiot. Perhaps you never read Clough’s Poems, did you? Scarcely a
                        day passes in which I do not echo to myself his words:— </p>
                    <quote><l> Ah well-a-day, for we are souls bereaved!</l><l> Of all the creatures
                            under heaven’s wide cope,</l><l> We are most hopeless who had once most
                            hope,</l></quote>
                    <p> ‘And do you think,’ said Miss Merton in a low tone, ‘that belief in these
                        days brings no painful perplexities too? Do you think that we can look out
                        on the state of the world now, and think about its future, without anxiety?
                        But really,’ she went on, raising her voice, ‘if I, like you, thought that
                        Christianity was not true, I should not waste my time in lamenting over it.
                        I should rather be glad that I had got free from a gigantic and awful
                        imposition.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What!’ exclaimed Laurence, ‘should we rejoice at our old guide dropping
                        dead amongst the mountains, even though he had lost his way; if so we are
                        left hopeless, and without any guide at all?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You have your consciences,’ said Miss Merton, with some decision in her
                        voice; ‘you surely don’t mean to say that you have lost them?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘As for our consciences,’ said Leslie, who was standing close by, ‘we revere
                        them so much that we fancy they possess some power. But conscience, in most
                        souls, is like an English Sovereign—it reigns, but it does not govern. Its
                        function is merely to give a formal assent to the Bills passed by the
                        passions; and it knows, if it opposes what those are really bent upon, that
                        ten to one it will be obliged to abdicate.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Let us hope that the constitutions of most souls are more stable than
                        that,’ said Miss Merton. ‘As far as morality goes, I expect you have quite
                        enough to guide you; and if you think religion false, I don’t see why its
                        loss should trouble you. And life itself, remember, has plenty of pleasures.
                        It is full of things worth living for.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Is it?’ exclaimed Leslie with sudden emphasis, and he looked into Miss
                        Merton’s face with an expression half absent and half wondering. ‘Is there
                        anything in life that you really think is, for its own sake, worth living
                        for? To me it seems that we are haunted with the power of imagining that
                        there might be, and are pursued with the knowledge that there never is. Look
                        at that lovely water before us, with its floods of moonlight—how it ripples,
                        how it sparkles away into the distance! What happiness sights like these
                        suggest to one! How happy they might make us—might, but they never do! They
                        only madden us with a vague pain, that I is like the sense of something lost
                        for ever.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Still,’ said Miss Merton, ‘life is not all moonlight. Surely friendship and
                        affection are worth having?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Let me beg you, Miss Merton,’ said Leslie, replying to her tone rather than
                        to her words, ‘not to think that I am always pining and bemoaning myself.
                        Fortunately the deeper part of one’s nature will often go to sleep, and then
                        the surface can enjoy itself. We can even laugh with our lips at the very
                        things that our hearts in silence are breaking for. But as for happiness,
                        that is always like prophecy, it is only fulfilled in the future; or else it
                        is a miracle—it only exists in the past. The actual things we wish for we
                        may very likely get, but they always come too late or too soon. When the boy
                        is in love, he tries to feel like a man; when the man is in love, he tries
                        to feel like a boy; and both in vain.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ exclaimed Laurence, ‘I think very differently from that. I know,’ he
                        said, turning to Miss Merton, ‘that friendship and affection are things
                        worth having; and if only pain and anxiety would leave me, I could enjoy the
                        taste of happiness.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Could you?’ said Leslie. ‘When I look at what we are and what the world is,
                        I can fancy no more melancholy spectacle than a happy man; though I admit,’
                        he added as he moved slowly away, ‘that there is none more amusing than a
                        man who tries to be melancholy.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Leslie is oddly changed,’ said Laurence, ‘since I saw him last. <hi>I</hi>
                        am distressed with life because I cannot find out its worth. <hi>He</hi> is
                        indignant at it, it seems, because he thinks he has found out its
                        worthlessness. And yet—I envy him his temperament. He never lets any
                        melancholy subdue him. He can always laugh it down in a moment; and he will
                        trample bravely on any of his sentiments if he is on the road to anything he
                        is proud of aiming at.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence was silent for a moment, and then said abruptly:— </p>
                    <p> ‘I dare say you think me very morbid; but perhaps you can hardly realise the
                        intense restless misery that a man endures when he can find nothing to do
                        which he really feels worth doing. Could I only find some one thing— one
                        great cause to labour for—one great idea—I could devote my whole self to it,
                        and be happy: for labour, after all, is the only thing that never palls on a
                        man. But such a cause, such an idea—I can find it nowhere. Politics have
                        turned into a petty, weary game; religion is dead. Our new prophets only
                        offer us Humanity, in place of the God of which they have deprived us. And
                        Humanity makes a very poor Deity, since it is every day disgracing itself,
                        and is never of the same mind from one week’s end to another. And so here I
                        am utterly alone—friendless, and with nothing to help me; feeling that, were
                        it not for the petty contemptible interests I manufacture for myself from
                        day to day, life would be quite unbearable.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And yet,’ said Miss Merton, ‘you have much to make you happy—much that you
                        would be sorry to lose.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I have a certain position,’ said Laurence, ‘and a certain amount of wealth,
                        and I would not willingly lose anything of either of these; but that is not
                        because, in my heart, I value them; but because, if I lost them, I might in
                        my heart cease to despise them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Surely,’ said Miss Merton, ‘there is a better way of looking at the matter.
                        You came into the world with all your lower ambitions satisfied for you. The
                        ground therefore is quite clear for the higher ambitions. That is why I
                        think an aristocracy, as a rule, must always be the best governors of men,
                        for their ambitions, as a rule, are the only genuine ones. Think, too, what
                        an advantage mere wealth is. The highest labour will never produce money,
                        but generally requires it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That is just the difficulty,’ said Laurence. ‘What shall I labour for? I am
                        almost maddened sometimes, as I sit all the day idle, and seem to hear the
                        hateful wasted moments slipping away from me. And I <hi>could</hi> do
                        something, I am sure. I feel I have powers.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I think,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that all I should say to you is, find
                        something to do. The power to find or make an object is, I think, a great
                        part of genius. However,’ she said, with some sympathy in her voice, ‘if you
                        are in difficulties, I am sure I wish I could help you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence in a subdued voice, ‘I’m sure I beg your pardon for my
                        egoism. I never talked so long about myself in my whole life before; and I
                        promise never to do so again.’ </p>
                    <p> Leslie meanwhile had moved away towards Mrs. Sinclair, who, looking
                        particularly fascinating, was still commanding the attentions of Dr.
                        Jenkinson. The Doctor was standing by her, all deferent gallantry, and, to
                        Leslie’s surprise, was saying something to her about Sappho. </p>
                    <p> ‘And now,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, with a little appealing dainty smile, ‘I want
                        to ask you something about the Greek Anthology too. I can’t read much Greek
                        myself: but a gentleman who used to be rather kind to me, translated me a
                        good deal of Greek poetry, once upon a time—when my husband,’ she said, with
                        a little shrug of the shoulders, ‘used to go to sleep after his dinner.’ </p>
                    <p> Dr. Jenkinson here glanced suspiciously at Mrs. Sinclair. </p>
                    <p> ‘Now, what I want you to tell me,’ she said, ‘is something about some
                        little—ahem—little love songs, I think they were—ἐρωτικ-something or other—I
                        really can’t pronounce the name.’ </p>
                    <p> The Doctor started. </p>
                    <p> ‘And, Dr. Jenkinson, please,’ Mrs. Sinclair went on in a voice of plaintive
                        innocence, ‘not to think me a terrible blue-stocking, because I ask you
                        these questions; for I really hardly know any Greek myself—except perhaps a
                        verse or two of the New Testament; and that’s not very good Greek, I
                        believe, is it? But the gentleman who translated so much to me, when he came
                        to these little poems I speak of, was continually, though he was a very good
                        scholar, quite unable to translate them. Now, why should that have been, I
                        want to know? Are Greek love-poems very hard?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said the Doctor, stammering, yet re-assured by Mrs. Sinclair’s
                        manner, ‘they were probably—your friend perhaps—well— they were a little
                        obscure perhaps—much Greek is—or—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Corrupt?’ suggested Mrs. Sinclair naively. </p>
                    <p> The word was a simple one: but it sufficed to work a miracle on Dr.
                        Jenkinson. For the first time in his life to a lady who united the two
                        charms of beauty and fashion, to both of which he was eminently susceptible,
                        Dr. Jenkinson was rude. He turned abruptly away, and staring hard at the
                        moon, not at Mrs. Sinclair, said simply, ‘I don’t know,’ with the most
                        chilling intonation of which those words are capable. He then moved a pace
                        away, and sat down on a chair close to Miss Merton. </p>
                    <p> Mrs. Sinclair turned to Leslie, with a flash in her eyes of soft suppressed
                        laughter. </p>
                    <p> ‘How lovely the evening is!’ murmured Leslie, responding to the smile. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, looking out dreamily over the sea, ‘it almost
                        realises one’s idea of perfect beauty.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really, Mrs. Sinclair,’ said Leslie, ‘you are certainly most Hellenic.
                        First you talk of Sappho, now of Ideas of Beauty. Are you a Platonist?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Mr. Leslie, of course I am,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, somewhat misapprehending
                        his meaning. ‘I never heard such an impertinent question. Platonism,
                        however, is a very rare philosophy in these days, I’m afraid.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, and so you too think we are all of us very bad, do you?’ said Leslie.
                        ‘It may be so, of course; and yet men at least often generalise very hastily
                        and very wrongly, I am sure. How often, for instance, do we say that all
                        wives nowadays are inconstant, simply because such are the only ones we
                        remember, not because they are the only ones we know.’ </p>
                    <p> This speech was quite in Mrs. Sinclair’s own manner, and she looked at
                        Leslie with a smile of appreciation half humorous and half sentimental, </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ she began to say, in a voice that had just a touch of sadness in it,
                        ‘if we could but all of us love only when we ought, and where we ought—’ But
                        here she paused. Her voice died away, and she leaned her head upon her hand
                        in silence. </p>
                    <p> Leslie was going to have spoken; but he was suddenly arrested by the sound
                        of Dr. Jenkinson, close beside him, talking to Miss Merton in a tone of
                        unusual earnestness. </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t wonder,’ he was saying, ‘that you should feel in perplexity
                        sometimes; whichever way we look at things there will be perplexities. But
                        there is such a thing as goodness; and goodness in the end must triumph, and
                        so in this large faith let us rest.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And,’ said Donald Gordon in his soft deferential voice, which always
                        sounded as if he was saying something deeply devotional, ‘don’t you think it
                        is a higher thing to be good for good’s own sake than for God’s? and,
                        whatever men may believe about having another life, and a beautiful heaven,
                        with gold streets, and with jewelled fortifications, don’t you think that
                        morality really is after all its own reward?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But what of those poor people,’ said Miss Merton, ‘who cannot be moral—whom
                        circumstances have kept from being ever anything but brutalised? I dare
                        say,’ she said, turning to the Doctor, quite forgetting his sacred
                        character, ‘that I shall hardly be able to make you understand such a notion
                        as that of living for God’s glory. But still, if there be not a God for
                        whose glory we can live, and who in his turn will not leave us all to
                        ourselves, what then? Think of all those who, in spite of hard surroundings,
                        have just had strength enough to struggle to be good, but to struggle
                        only—whose whole moral being has been left writhing in the road of life,
                        like an animal that a cart-wheel has gone over, just lifting its eyes up
                        with a piteous appeal at us who will not help it—’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton looked at Dr. Jenkinson and paused. The moon shone tenderly on
                        his silver hair, and his keen eyes had something very like moisture in them. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ he said; ‘these are great, great difficulties. But there is another
                        life in store for us—another life, and a God. And don’t think that the world
                        is growing to disbelieve in these. Remember how many intelligent laymen
                        count themselves members of the Church of England, simply because they
                        believe in these two doctrines.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It has always been inexplicable to me,’ said Mr. Storks, who had been
                        attracted by the sound of the Doctor’s voice, ‘whence this longing for a
                        future life could have arisen. I suppose there are few things the very
                        possibility of which science so conclusively disproves.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And yet,’ said Laurence, who had been speaking for a moment to Mrs.
                        Sinclair, ‘I can’t help thinking at certain times that there may be a whole
                        world of things undreamed of by our scientific philosophy. Such a feeling is
                        touched by the sight of an “Ora pro animâ mea,” or a “Resurgam,” on a quiet
                        tombstone, or the sign of the cross made by a mother in hope and in sorrow
                        on the forehead of her dead child.’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton looked at Laurence with some wonder in her large expressive
                        eyes, Mr. Storks snorted, and Dr. Jenkinson blinked. </p>
                    <p> ‘See,’ said Donald Goidon,’ the moonlight grows brighter and brighter every
                        moment. It is almost bewildering in its dazzling paleness.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And there,’ said Laurence, ‘do you catch it?—that is the light-ship on the
                        horizon, like a large low star.’ Laurence seated himself on the balustrade,
                        and, leaning on his elbow, looked up into the clear hollow skies. </p>
                    <p> ‘World upon world,’ he exclaimed at last, ‘and each one crowded, very
                        likely, with beings like ourselves, wondering what this whole great universe
                        is!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And the vast majority of them believing in a wise and just God,’ said
                        Leslie, ‘for I see no reason why ours should be the stupidest world in all
                        creation.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Laurence, ‘and in each world a small select band, that has
                        pierced through such a husk of lies, and has discovered the all-golden
                        truth, that the universe is aimless, and that for good and evil the end is
                        all one.’ </p>
                    <p> Dr. Jenkinson had a sensible horror of the stars: and as soon as they were
                        mentioned, he turned round in his chair, giving his back to the group, Miss
                        Merton included; whilst Mr. Storks walked away, not without dignity, </p>
                    <p> ‘Mrs. Sinclair is going to sing in a moment,’ said Laurence; ‘some one is
                        gone to fetch her guitar.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Hush!’ exclaimed Miss Merton, ‘do just listen to this.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Good gracious!’ said Laurence in a whisper, ‘Mr. Storks is at my aunt at
                        last.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Storks had been watching ever since dinner for an opportunity of
                        discussing with Lady Grace the true position of woman, as settled by modern
                        science. He was peculiarly full of this subject just now, having received
                        only that morning a letter from a celebrated American physician, who stated
                        very strongly as his opinion, that the strain of what is called the higher
                        education was most prejudicial to the functions of maternity, and that the
                        rights of woman might very probably be fatal to the existence of man. As
                        soon as he got hold of Lady Grace, he led up to this point with startling
                        rapidity; having been perfectly charmed at starting to find that she fully
                        agreed with him that the prejudices of the present day were doing more harm
                        to woman’s true interests than anything else. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is a pleasure,’ said Mr. Storks, ‘to discuss these matters with a person
                        so thoroughly enlightened as yourself. You will of course see from what Dr.
                        Boston says how entirely suicidal is the scheme of turning woman into a
                        female man. Nature has marked out her mission for her plainly enough; and so
                        our old friend Milton was right in his meaning after all, when he says that
                        man is made for God, and woman for God through him, though of course the
                        expression is antiquated.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Surely,’ said Lady Grace with animation, ‘not only the expression is
                        antiquated, but the meaning also is contrary to all true fairness and
                        enlightment.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I confess, I don’t see that,’ said Mr. Storks with a look of smiling
                        deference. </p>
                    <p> ‘What!’ cried Lady Grace, ‘is it not contrary to reason—let me put it to
                        your own candour—for a man who knows that his wife, ages hence, will be a
                        seraph singing before the throne of God, to consider her only made for God
                        through him—to consider her, indeed, as a thing made simply for her
                        husband’s use?’ </p>
                    <p> This answer of Lady Grace’s took Mr. Storks quite aback. He knew not how to
                        comport himself. His jaw fell—he stared— he said nothing. He felt as though
                        he had been assassinated. But luckily at this very moment, liquid and clear,
                        and exquisitely modulated, were heard the sounds of Mrs. Sinclair’s voice,
                        singing the following song— </p>
                    <quote><l> Darling, can you endure the liquid weather,</l><l>   The
                            jasmine-scented twilights, oh my dear?</l><l> Or do you still remember
                            how together</l><l>   We read the sad sweet Idyll ‘Guinevere,’</l><l>
                                  Love, in one last year’s twilight?</l><l> Galeotto fu il libro, e

                            unheeding</l><l>   Did I read to you that tender tale,</l><l> Oh my
                            love, until my voice, in reading</l><l>   How those lovers greeted
                            ‘passion-pale,’</l><l>       Trembled in the soft twilight.</l><l>

                            met, and then all was over —</l><l>   All the world receded cold and

                            us shook a silver star,</l><l>       Through depths of melting

                            the dawnless twilight.</l></quote>
                    <p> ‘What a lovely voice!’ said Laurence to Miss Merton. ‘I wonder how she will
                        sound singing before the throne.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘She will be obliged to take lessons in a rather different style,’ said Miss
                        Merton, unable to suppress a smile; and then she suddenly checked herself,
                        and looked grave. ‘Mrs. Sinclair has always interested me,’ she said. ‘I
                        often come across her in London, but I hardly know her.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Mr. Laurence,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, ‘you must now make Mr. Leslie sing, for
                        I discover that he can play the guitar too.’ </p>
                    <p> Leslie was of course pressed, and with some reluctance consented. </p>
                    <p> ‘I suppose,’ he said, ‘we are all of us more or less moon-struck to-night,
                        so I had best sing the silliest thing I know; and as I don’t think anything
                        can be sillier than a song I once wrote myself, I will sing that.’ </p>
                    <p> He touched a few chords carelessly, and yet with the manner of a practised
                        player; paused for a moment, and then again striking the instrument began to
                        sing. He was watched at first with merely a languid curiosity; and Miss
                        Prattle whispered to Lady Ambrose that his attitude was very affected; but
                        curiosity and criticism were both lost in surprise at the first sound of his
                        rich and flexible voice, and still more so at the real passion which he
                        breathed into the following words, rude and artless as they were:— </p>
                    <quote>
                        <l><hi>    Oh, her cheek, her cheek was pale,</hi></l><l><hi>     Her voice
                                was hardly musical;</hi></l><l><hi> But your proud grey eyes grew

                                         Margaret.</hi></l><l><hi> </hi></l><l><hi>     Child, what
                                have I done to thee?</hi></l><l><hi>     Child, what hast thou done

                    <p> Leslie received loud thanks from many voices, especially from Lady Ambrose.
                        Some, however, were almost silent from surprise at the feeling, which he
                        seemed quite unconsciously to have betrayed. Mrs. Sinclair held out her hand
                        to him, when no one was looking, and said quietly, ‘Thank you so much, I
                        can’t tell you how I like your song.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, as the party moved indoors into the lighted
                        drawing-room, ‘we have been all of us very sentimental to-night, and if we
                        can’t get better now, I hope we shall sleep it off, and wake up well and
                        sane to-morrow morning.’ </p>
                    <p> This being Saturday night, there sprang up some vague mention of church. The
                        nearest church however was some miles distant, and a rumour arose amongst
                        the guests that Dr. Jenkinson would perform the service and preach a sermon
                        in the private chapel. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                    <p> On the following morning Lady Ambrose awoke somewhat out of spirits. Last
                        night, whilst her maid was brushing her hair, she had pondered deeply over
                        much that she had heard during the evening; and her thoughts having been
                        once started in such a direction, the conviction quickly dawned upon her
                        that the world was indeed becoming very bad, and that society was on the
                        point of dissolution. This was quite a new view of things to her, and it had
                        all the charm of novelty. Still, however, she would probably have found by
                        the morning that she had successfully slept it off, if the post had not
                        failed to bring her an invitation to the Duchess of ———’s garden-party at
                        ——— House, which she was expecting with some anxiety. As it was, therefore,
                        her spirits failed to recover themselves, and whilst she was being dressed
                        her thoughts wandered wistfully away to the promised morning service in the
                        chapel. At breakfast, however, another blow awaited her. How a private
                        chapel had come to be mentioned last evening was not clear. Certainly there
                        was no such appendage to Laurence’s villa, and the susceptibilities of Lady
                        Ambrose received a severe shock, as she learnt that the ministrations of Dr.
                        Jenkinson, the comfort of which she was looking forward to, were to take
                        place in the theatre which adjoined the house. She bore up, however, like a
                        brave woman, and resolving that nothing, on her part at least, should be
                        wanting, she appeared shortly before eleven o’clock, in full Sunday costume,
                        with her bonnet, and her books of devotion. </p>
                    <p> Mrs. Sinclair looked at her in dismay. ‘I had thought,’ she said plaintively
                        to Laurence, ‘that, as this was only a morning performance, I need not make
                        a toilette. And as for a prayer-book, why, dear Mr. Laurence, I have not had
                        one since I was confirmed.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Not when you were married?’ said Leslie. </p>
                    <p> ‘Perhaps,’ said Mrs. Sinclair pensively, ‘but I have forgotten all about
                        that—now.’ </p>
                    <p> At this moment the gong sounded, and the whole party, Lady Ambrose and her
                        bonnet amongst them, adjourned to the place of worship, which was connected
                        with the house by a long corridor. </p>
                    <p> When the party entered they found themselves in a complete miniature
                        theatre, with the gas, as there were no windows, fully burning. It had been
                        arranged beforehand that the guests should occupy the boxes, the gallery
                        being appropriated to the servants, whilst the stalls were to remain
                        completely empty. The congregation entered with great decorum and gradually
                        settled themselves in their places with a subdued whispering. Lady Ambrose
                        buried her face in her hands for a few moments, and several of the younger
                        ladies followed her example. Everyone then looked about them silently, in
                        suspense and expectation. The scene that met their eyes was certainly not
                        devotional. The whole little semicircle glittered with heavy gilding and
                        with hangings of crimson satin, and against these the stucco limbs of a
                        number of gods and goddesses gleamed pale and prominent. The gallery rested
                        on the heads of nine scantily-draped Muses, who, had they been two less in
                        number, might have passed for the seven deadly sins; round the frieze in
                        high relief reeled a long procession of Fauns and Bacchanals; and half the
                        harem of Olympus sprawled and floated on the azure ceiling. Nor was this
                        all. The curtain was down, and, brilliantly illuminated as it was, displayed
                        before the eyes of the congregation Faust on the Brocken, with a long plume,
                        dancing with the young witch, who could boast of no costume at all. The
                        scene was so strange that everyone forgot to whisper or even to smile. There
                        was a complete silence, and the eyes of all were soon fixed upon the curtain
                        in wonder and expectation. </p>
                    <p> Presently a sound was heard. A door opened, and Dr. Jenkinson, in his
                        ordinary dress, entered the stalls. He looked deliberately round him for a
                        moment, as though he were taking stock of those present; then, selecting the
                        central stall as a kind of <hi>prie-dieu</hi>, he knelt down facing his
                        congregation, and after a moment’s pause began to read the service in a
                        simple, earnest voice. Lady Ambrose, however, though she knew her
                        prayer-book as well as most women, could not for the life of her find the
                        place. The reason was not far to seek. The Doctor was opening the
                        proceedings with the following passage from the Koran, which he had once
                        designed to use in Westminster Abbey as the text of a missionary sermon. </p>
                    <p> ‘Be constant in prayer,’ he began, in a voice tremulous with emotion, ‘and
                        give alms: and what good ye have sent before for your souls, ye shall find
                        it with God. Surely God seeth that which ye do. They say, Verily none shall
                        see Paradise except they be Jews or Christians. This is their wish. Say ye,
                        Produce your proof of this if ye speak truth. Nay, but he who resigneth
                        himself to God, and doeth that which is right, he shall have his reward with
                        his Lord; there shall come no fear on them, neither shall they be
                            grieved.’<note n=" 1"><p> Koran, chap. ii. Sale’s
                            Translation.</p></note>
                    </p>
                    <p> Dr. Jenkinson then went on to the Confession, the Absolution, and a number
                        of other selections from the English morning service, omitting, however, the
                        creed, and concluded the whole with a short prayer of St. Francis Xavier’s. </p>
                    <p> But it was discovered that his voice, unless he made an effort, was
                        unhappily only partly audible from the position which he occupied; and
                        Laurence, as soon as the Liturgy was over, went softly up to him to apprise
                        him of the fact. Dr. Jenkinson was very grateful for being thus told in
                        time. It was fortunate, he said, that the prayers only had been missed; the
                        question was, where should he go for the sermon. Laurence in a diffident
                        manner proposed the stage; but the Doctor accepted the proposal with great
                        alacrity, and Laurence went immediately out with him to conduct him to his
                        new pulpit. In a few moments the curtain was observed to twitch and tremble;
                        two or three abortive pulls were evidently being made; and at last Faust and
                        the young witch rapidly rolled up, and discovered first the feet and legs,
                        and then the entire person of Doctor Jenkinson, standing in the middle of a
                        gorge in the Indian Caucasus—the remains of a presentation of Prometheus
                        Bound which had taken place last February. </p>
                    <p> The Doctor was not a man to be abashed by incongruities. He looked about him
                        for a moment: he slightly raised his eyebrows, and then, without the least
                        discomposure, and in a clear incisive voice, began:— </p>
                    <p> ‘In the tenth verse of the hundred and eleventh Psalm, it is said, “The fear
                        of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” The fear of the Lord,’ he again
                        repeated, more slowly, and with more emphasis, surveying the theatre as he
                        spoke, ‘is the beginning of wisdom.’ </p>
                    <p> He then made a long pause, looking down at his feet, as if, although he held
                        his sermon-book in his hand, he were considering how to begin. As he stood
                        there silent, the footlights shining brightly on his silver hair, Lady
                        Ambrose had full time to verify the text in her prayer-book. At last the
                        Doctor suddenly raised his head, and with a gentle smile of benignity
                        playing on his lips, shook open his manuscript, and thus proceeded:— </p>
                    <p><hi> ‘The main difficulty that occupied the early Greek Philosophers, as soon
                            as philosophy in its proper sense can be said to have begun, was the
                            great dualism that seemed to run through all things. Matter and mind,
                            the presence of imperfection, and the idea of perfection, or the unity
                            and plurality of being, were amongst the various forms in which the two
                            contradictory elements of things were presented to them, as demanding
                            reconcilement or explanation. This manner of viewing things comes to a
                            head, so to speak, amongst the ancients, in the system of Plato. With
                            him the sensible and the intelligible worlds stand separated by a great
                            gulf, the one containing all good, the other of itself only evil, until
                            we recognise its relation to the good, and see that it is only a shadow
                            and a type of it. The world of real existence is something outside, and
                            virtually unconnected with, this world of mere phenomena; and the
                            Platonic prayer is that we should be taken out of the world, rather
                            than, as Christ says, with a fuller wisdom, that we should be delivered
                            from the evil.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p><hi>Plato had, however, by thus dwelling on this antagonism in things, paved
                            the way for a reconciliation—some say he even himself began it. At any
                            rate, it was through him that it was nearly, if not quite, accomplished
                            by his disciple Aristotle. Aristotle first systematised the great
                            principle of evolution, and transformed what had appeared to former
                            thinkers as the dualism of mind and matter into a single scale of
                            ascending existences. Thus what Plato had conceived of as two worlds,
                            were now presented as opposite poles of the same. The πρώτη ὕλη, the
                            world “without form and void,” receiving form, at length culminated in
                            the soul of man; and in the soul of man sensation at length culminated
                            in pure thought.’</hi> A slight cough here escaped from Mrs. Sinclair.
                            <hi>‘You will perhaps think,’</hi> the Doctor went on, <hi>‘that a
                            sermon is not the place in which to discuss such differences of secular
                            opinion; or you will perhaps think that such differences are of no very
                            great moment. But if you look under the surface, and at the inner
                            meaning of them, you will find that they bear upon questions which are,
                            or ought to be, of the very highest moment to each of us—questions
                            indeed,’</hi> the Doctor added, suddenly lowering his manuscript for a
                        moment, and looking sharply round at his audience, <hi>‘which we all of us
                            here have very lately—very lately indeed—either discussed ourselves, or
                            heard discussed by others.’</hi> This produced an immediate sensation,
                        especially amongst the feminine part of the listeners, to whom the discourse
                        thus far had seemed strange, rather than significant. <hi>‘The
                            question,’</hi> the Doctor continued, <hi>‘is one of the relations of
                            the spiritual to the natural; and the opposition between the views of
                            these two ancient philosophers is by no means obsolete in our own
                            century. There is even now far too prevalent a tendency to look upon the
                            spiritual as something transcending and completely separate from the
                            natural; and there is in the minds of many well-meaning and earnest
                            persons a sort of alarm felt at any attempt to bring the two into
                            connection. This feeling is experienced not by Christians only, but by a
                            large number of their opponents. There is, for instance, no doctrine
                            more often selected for attack by those who oppose Christianity upon
                            moral grounds, than that of which my text is an expression, I mean the
                            doctrine of a morality enforced by rewards and punishments. Such
                            morality, we hear it continually urged by men who set themselves up as
                            advanced thinkers, is no morality at all. No action can be good, they
                            tell us, that does not spring from the love of good. Virtue is no longer
                            virtue if it springs from fear. The very essence of it is to spring from
                            freedom. Now, these arguments, though specious at the first blush of the
                            thing, are really, if we look them honestly in the face, to the utmost
                            shallow and unphilosophical. They are really but so many denials of the
                            great doctrine of evolution—so many attempts to set up again that
                            absolute antagonism between good and evil which it has been the aim of
                            all the higher thinkers, and of Christ himself, to do away with. If,
                            then, these modern critics of Christianity come to us with such
                            objections, let us not try to disguise the truth that the morality of
                            our religion is based on fear. Let us rather boldly avow this, and try
                            to point out to them that it is they, and not the Psalmist, that are out
                            of harmony with modern thought. For what is it that the sacred Scripture
                            says? “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” The beginning,
                            you will please to observe—the beginning only. It is not perfect wisdom,
                            it is not perfect virtue; but it is the beginning of both of these. It
                            is, if I may be allowed the expression, the moral protoplasm—it is that
                            out of which they are both evolved. It is, as Aristotle would call it,
                            their potentiality. The actuality is different from the potentiality;
                            for “perfect love” as St. John says, “casteth out fear.” Putting
                            together, then, the ideas of these two good men, St. John and Aristotle,
                            we may say that the love of God—that is, true wisdom—is the actuality of
                            the fear of Him. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘This account of the origin of the true wisdom may not, indeed, be
                            applicable to each individual case. Some persons’</hi> — the Doctor’s
                        voice here grew very soft, and seemed as though it would almost break with
                            feeling—<hi>’ some persons may have been so fortunate as to have
                            received the truest wisdom into their hearts by education, almost with
                            their mother’s milk. But there are those not so fortunate, who may have
                            needed the discipline of a godly fear to lead them upwards front a
                            “wallowing in the sensual sty” towards the higher life. And just as this
                            is true of many of us individually, so it is still more deeply true of
                            the human race as a whole. All study of history, and of social science,
                            and of philosophy, is teaching this to us every day with increasing
                            clearness. The human race, as soon as it became human, feared God before
                            it loved Him. Its fear, as the Scripture puts it, was the beginning of
                            its wisdom; or as modern thought has put it, in slightly different
                            words, the love of justice sprang out of the fear of suffering
                            injustice. Thus the end is different from the beginning, and yet springs
                            out of it. Ethics, as it has been well said, are the finest fruits of
                            humanity, but they are not its roots. Our reverence for truth, all our
                            sacred family ties, and the purest and most exalted forms of matrimonial
                            attachment, have each their respective origins in self-interest,
                            self-preservation, and animal appetite. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘There is, I admit, in this truth something that may at first sight
                            repel us, and perhaps even prompt some of us to deny indignantly that it
                            is a truth at all. But this is really a cowardly and unworthy feeling,
                            fatal to any true comprehension of God’s dealings with man, and arising
                            from a quite mistaken conception of our own dignity, and our own
                            connection with God. It is some such mistaken conception as this that
                            sets so many of us against the discoveries of modern science as to the
                            origin of our own species, and, what is far worse, prompts us to oppose
                            such discoveries with dishonest objections. How is it possible, some of
                            us ask, that man with his sublime conceptions of duty and of God, and
                            his fine apparatus of reason, and so forth, should be produced by any
                            process of evolution from a beastly and irrational ape? But to ask such
                            questions as these is really to call in question the power of God, and
                            so to do Him dishonour. It is true that we cannot trace out, as yet, all
                            the steps of this wonderful evolution; but let us not be found, like
                            doubting Thomas, resolved not to believe until we have actually seen.
                            And yet, if our faith does indeed require strengthening, we have only to
                            look a little more attentively at the commonest facts before us. For is
                            it not, let me ask you—to take, for instance, a man’s sublime faculty of
                            reasoning and logical comprehension—far more wonderful that a reasoning
                            man should have the same parents as a woman, than that they both should
                            have the same parents as a monkey? Science and religion both alike teach
                            us that with God all things are possible. </hi></p>
                    <p><hi> ‘I just touch in passing upon this doctrine that we popularly call
                            Darwinism, because it is the most familiar example to us of the doctrine
                            of evolution. But the point which I am wishing to emphasize is not the
                            outward evolution of man, but the inward, of which, however, the former
                            is an image and a likeness. This theory of moral evolution, I wish to
                            point out to you, is alike the Christian and the scientific theory; and
                            I thus wish you to see that the very points in which science seems most
                            opposed to Christianity are really those in which it most fundamentally
                            agrees with it. I will therefore just ask you to notice how foolish and
                            short-sighted those persons are who think that a great result is
                            lessened if it can be proved to have had small beginnings. Is a state
                            less truly a state because we know that it has sprung out of the germ of
                            the family? Surely not. Neither is man less truly man if he have sprung
                            from an ape; nor is love less truly love if it has sprung from fear.

                        <hi>‘And so now, since we have seen how science and Christianity are at one
                            as to the rise of the moral sentiments, I will pass on to a wider point,
                            the character and the history of Christianity itself, both of which have
                            been misunderstood and misinterpreted for at least eighteen hundred
                            years; and when I have pointed out how this great subject is being now
                            explained by the methods of modern science, I will pass on to an issue
                            that is wider yet. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘The world has hitherto failed to understand Christianity, because it
                            studied it upon a false method—a method based upon that old dualistic
                            theory of things of which I have already spoken. Just as Plato looked
                            upon mind as entirely distinct from matter, so used Christians to look
                            upon things sacred as entirely distinct from things secular. But now
                            this middle wall of partition is being broken down by science, and by
                            scientific criticism, and by a wider view of things in general. The
                            primary way in which all this has affected Christianity, is by the new
                            spirit in which it has led us to study the Bible. We used to look upon
                            the Bible as a book standing apart by itself, and to be interpreted by a
                            peculiar canon of criticism. But we have now learnt that it is to be
                            studied just like all other books; and we are now for the first time
                            coming to understand what, in its true grandeur, a real revelation is.
                            We are learning, in fact, that just as no single scripture “is of any
                            private interpretation;” still less is the entire body of the
                            Scriptures. They, too, must be interpreted by their context. We must
                            inquire into their origin; we must ask diligently under what
                            circumstances they were written and edited, and for what ends. Nor must
                            we ever again fall into such quaint and simple mistakes as did
                            commentators like Origen, or Augustine, or Tertullian, or even Paul
                            himself, whose discoveries of Messianic prophecies in writings like the
                            Psalms for instance, are really much the same as would be a discovery on
                            our part in Mr. Tennyson’s line on the death of the Duke of Wellington,
                            “The last great Englishman is </hi>low<hi>,” a prophecy of the late
                            Chancellor of the Exchequer. But to understand the meaning of any text,
                            we must try to see what, from his position and education, the writer
                            could have meant by it; not what this or that Father, living long
                            afterwards, fancied that he meant. Our motto in religion, as in science,
                            should be, “Vere scire est per causas scire.” </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘If we study Christianity reverently and carefully upon these
                            principles, we shall see that it was not a thing that sprang up, as we
                            used to fancy, without any human antecedents, but that its roots reach
                            back with many ramifications into the western and oriental thought of
                            preceding centuries. We shall see how it absorbed into itself all that
                            was highest in Hebraistic Theism and in Hellenic thought—something too,
                            let us admit, of the failings of both. I cannot here enter into any of
                            the details of this, what may be truly termed pre-Christian
                            Christianity. I can only briefly point out its existence, and its double
                            origin, commenting on these by the following few lines from a great
                            German writer. “The yearning after a higher revelation” he tells us,
                            “was the universal characteristic of the last centuries of the ancient
                            world. This was in the first place but a consciousness of the decline of
                            the classical nations and their culture, and the presentiment of the
                            approach of a new era; and it called into life not only Christianity,
                            but also, and before it, Pagan and Jewish Alexandrianism, and other
                            related developments.” </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘This, then, is the great point to be borne in mind—viz. that God had
                            been preparing the way for the coming of Christ long before he sent
                            “Elias, which was for to be.” Neither John Baptist, no, nor One greater
                            than John, was left by God (as the children of Israel were left by
                            Pharaoh) to gather straw himself to make bricks. The materials were all
                            prepared ready to their hands by their Heavenly Father. And so, let us
                            be especially and prayerfully on our guard against considering
                            Christianity as having come into the world at once, ready-made, so to
                            speak, by our Saviour, as a body of theological doctrines. Any honest
                            study of history will show us that the Apostles received no such system;
                            that our Lord Himself never made any claim to the various characters
                            with which subsequent thought invested Him; and that to attribute such
                            claims to Him, would be an anachronism, of which He would Himself have
                            scarcely understood the meaning. If we only clear our eyes of any false
                            theological glamour, a very slight study of the inspired writers will at
                            once show us this. We shall see how uncertain and shifting at first
                            everything was. We shall see what a variety of conflicting opinions the
                            early Church entertained even upon the most fundamental subjects—such,
                            for instance, as the identity of the God of the Old Testament with the
                            God of the New, which was denied by a large number of the early
                            Christians: we shall see how widely divergent were the systems of Jewish
                            and Pauline Christianity, and how discrepant and tentative are the
                            accounts given by St. Paul and by the author of the Fourth Gospel of the
                            mystical nature of Christ, whom they tried to identify with different
                            mysterious potencies supposed by the Jewish-Alexandrian philosophers to
                            be coexistent with God. And if we pursue the history of the Church a
                            little farther, we shall find many more things to startle us. We shall
                            find, for instance, the most renowned apologist of early Catholic times,
                            a materialist, holding the materiality not of the soul of man only, but
                            of God also. “Nihil enim”—these are this father’s words—“si non corpus.
                            Omne quod est, corpus est.” Thus we see,’</hi> said the Doctor
                        cheerfully, looking round him with a smile of benignant triumph, and
                        blinking with his eyes, <hi>‘that difference of opinion about the dogmas of
                            religion is nothing new. It existed in the Jewish Church; the phenomenon
                            was only prolonged by Christianity. Later Judaism and primitive
                            Christianity were both made up of a variety of systems, all honestly and
                            boldly thought out, differing widely from each other, and called by the
                            honourable appellation of heresies: and of these, let me remind you, it
                            is the glory of the Church of England to be composed likewise. </hi></p>
                    <p><hi> ‘Nor is this all,’</hi> he went on in a softer and more appealing tone;
                            <hi>‘not only are all these things so confused and doubtful; but we now
                            see that, in the face of recent criticism, we cannot even be quite sure
                            about any of the details of the divine life of our Lord. But in all
                            this’</hi>—the Doctor’s voice here became still more aërial, and he
                        fixed his eyes upon the painted ceiling of the theatre, as though he were
                        gazing on some glorious vision—<hi>‘in all this there is nothing to
                            discompose us. We can be quite sure that He lived, and that He went
                            about doing good, and that in him we have, in the highest sense,
                            everlasting life. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Let us then no longer fight against the conclusions of science and of
                            criticism, but rather see in them the hand of God driving us, even
                            against our will, away from beliefs and teachings that are not really
                            those of His son. If we do not do this—if we persist in identifying the
                            false Christianity with the true—the false, when it is at last plucked
                            widely away from us, as it must be, will carry away a part of the true
                            with it. And as long as we are in this state of mind, we are never for a
                            moment safe. We can never open a philological review, or hear of a
                            scientific experiment, without trembling. Witness the discussions now
                            engaging so much public attention on the subject of animal automatism,
                            and the marvellous results which experiments on living subjects have of
                            late days revealed to us; a frog with half a brain having destroyed more
                            theology than all the doctors of the Church with their whole brains can
                            ever build up again. Thus does God choose the “weak things of this world
                            to confound the wise.” Seeing, then, that this is the state of the case,
                            we should surely learn henceforth not to identify Christianity with
                            anything that science can assail, or even question. Let us say rather
                            that nothing is or can be essential to the religion of Christ which,
                            when once stated, can be denied without absurdity. If we can only attain
                            to this conception, we shall see truly that this our faith is indeed one
                            “that no man taketh away from us.” </hi></p>
                    <p><hi> ‘If we be thus once “stablished in the faith” all human history, and the
                            history of Christianity especially, will assume for us a new sacredness
                            and a new significance. We shall recognise gladly its long struggles of
                            growth, and its struggles for existence, and see how in all these were
                            at work the great principles of evolution. We shall see how Christian
                            perfection emerged gradually out of imperfection—nay, that it was only
                            through imperfection that this perfection was possible. For although, as
                            we now know, all the various theological systems that have sprung up
                            about Christianity, and have been so long current, are not Christianity,
                            are most of them, indeed, not even sense—yet it was through these that
                            true Christianity made its way, and extended itself in a corrupt and
                            ignorant world. For the world has been given from age to age just so
                            much of the truth as it has been able to bear, and it is only, let us
                            remember, from receiving it tempered in this wise proportion, that it
                            has been able to receive it at all. But these times of the world’s
                            probation are now passing away. It is now at length ceasing to be under
                            “tutors and governors;” it is learning to “put away childish things.” It
                            is coming to a sense that it is now fitted to receive Christ’s truth
                            pure, and without any admixture or wrappage of falsehood. And so, as it
                            looks back over all the various opinions once so fiercely agitated about
                            religion, it recognises in all of them a common element of good, and it
                            sees that all theologians and all sects have really agreed with one
                            another, and been meaning the same thing, even when they least suspected
                            or wished it. Nor is it, as modern study is showing us, varieties of
                            Christianity only that this deeper unity underlies, but all other
                            religions also. It has been well observed by a great Roman Catholic
                            writer now living, that whenever any great saintliness of life is to be
                            observed amongst infidels and heretics, it is always found to be due to
                            the presence of certain beliefs and rules which belong to the Catholics.
                            And in like manner, we may say too, that whenever any great saintliness
                            of life is to be observed amongst Catholics, it is due to the presence
                            of certain beliefs and rules that belong to the infidels and the
                            heretics—and indeed to all good men, no matter what their religion is.

                    <p><hi> ‘Such are the views that all the most enlightened men of our own day are
                            coming to. But the process is gradual; and meanwhile let us not rebuke

                            us rather bear with them, and make all allowance for them; for we must
                            remember, as I have said before, that those evils to which they still
                            cling, but from which we, under God’s mercy, are trying to free
                            ourselves, have done good service in their time; and that even such
                            doctrines as those of eternal punishment, or of sacerdotal absolution,
                            or the subtleties of sacramental systems, or the mystical paradoxes of
                            the Athanasian Creed, have assisted in the evolution of the good—have
                            been, in some sense, “schoolmasters to bring men to God.” And even if we
                            do occasionally come across some incident in the history of our
                            religion—some doctrine or body of doctrines, which seems, humanly
                            speaking, to subserve no good end at all—such as our own Thirty-nine
                            Articles—let us not suffer such to try our faith, but let us trust in
                            God, believing that in His secret councils He has found some fitting use
                            even for these; because we know how many things there are, in every
                            branch of inquiry, that we cannot explain, and yet we know that nothing
                            happens but by those immutable and eternal laws which our Heavenly
                            Father has Himself ordained, and of which He is Himself the highest
                            synthesis. </hi></p>

                            <hi>‘I shall pass on to that wider point to which I have already
                            alluded, which is indeed that which I wish chiefly to impress upon you,
                            and to which all that I have hitherto said has been preparatory. We have
                            come to see how genuine Christianity has been enabled to grow and extend
                            itself only through an admixture of what we now recognise as evil. And
                            seeing this, we shall be led on to a conclusion that is much wider. It
                            has been said that it is the part of the devil to see in good the germs
                            of evil. Is it not also the part of the devil not to recognise in evil
                            the germs of good? May we not indeed say with St. Augustine, that
                            absolute evil is impossible, because, if we look at it rightly, it is
                            always rising up into good? And so, may we not recognise in all things
                            the presence and the providence of God? </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Perhaps this view may at first sight seem difficult. Some of us may
                            find that we have a certain amount of pride to swallow before we can
                            cheerfully acquiesce in it. It is not an uncommon thing to find persons
                            who secretly flatter their vanity by cherishing a gloomy view of the
                            world and of mankind. But if we can only get free from these
                            littlenesses, and attain to that view which I have indicated, it will
                            enlarge and ameliorate our own philosophy of things, and bring life and
                            trust to us, in the place of doubt and despondency. Evil will then
                            appear to us simply as undeveloped good—as something which we may
                            acquiesce in without complaining—as something that has assisted in the
                            development of whatever is good in the present, and which will itself
                            one day become good in the future. Indeed it is not too much to say that
                            all things, in a certain sense, existed first in the form of evil. It
                            was not till after the Spirit of God had worked on the primeval matter
                            that God pronounced the world to be “very good.” </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘And so, if we consider the subject thus, we shall learn to put a stop
                            to all those fretful wailings over the badness of our own times of which
                            we hear so much—wailings over the unbelief of our neighbours, the
                            corruption of society, the misery of the poor, the luxury of the rich,
                            or the decline of commercial morality. The present is an age of change,
                            and is therefore at every turn presenting to us some new feature. But if
                            these come to us in the apparent guise of evils, let us not uselessly
                            bemoan them; but let us believe that they are, even if we cannot see
                            that it is so, but the beginnings, the embryos of new good. Indeed, by
                            the eye of faith, even in the present day, may be discerned the
                            beautiful spectacle of good actually shining through evil. May we not,
                            for instance, discern the well-being of the rich through the misery of
                            the poor? and again, the honest industry of the poor through the
                            idleness of the rich? </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘If, then, these things be so, surely we may look on unmoved at the
                            great changes and commotions that are going on around its, and the new
                            forms that society, and thought, and politics are assuming, even
                            although for the moment they may appear threatening. And if in this
                            great storm our Master have fallen asleep, and no longer speak audibly
                            to us, let us not be of little faith and fearful, and try to awaken Him
                            with our foolish clamours; but let us trust all to Him, and follow His
                            example. For really, if we do but trust in God, there is no ground for
                            fear, but “all things work together for good to him that believeth.”
                            And, however the matter may strike us at first sight, the times we live
                            in are really the times that are best fitted for us; and we shall see,
                            if we will but think soberly, that we could not, as a whole, alter
                            anything in them for the better. I do not mean that we have not each of
                            us his own work marked out for him to do; but all this work is strictly
                            in relation to things as they are. God has given to us the general
                            conditions under which we are to serve Him, and these are the best and
                            indeed the only conditions for us. Doubtless, if we each do the duty
                            that lies before us, these conditions will be slowly and insensibly
                            changed by us; but we shall ourselves change also, as well as the
                            conditions; what I mean is, that supposing by a sudden act of will we
                            could do what we pleased with the conditions of the age, we, being as we
                            are, should not be really able to make the age better. We should not be
                            really able to make it different. Any Utopia we might imagine would, if
                            it were a thinkable one, be only our own age in a masquerading dress.
                            For we cannot escape from our age, or add, except in a very small
                            degree, anything that is really new to it. Nor need we wish to do so.
                            Our age is for us the best age possible. We are its children, and it is
                            our only true parent. But though we cannot alter our time at a stroke,
                            so to speak, no, not even in imagination, we can all of us help to do so
                            little by little, if we do cheerfully the duties that are set before us.
                            And if we do this, which is what Christ bids us to do, then is Christ
                            made manifest in us, and lives in the hearts of every one of us; and in
                            a far higher sense than any mere physical one, He is risen from the
                            dead. And if He be not so risen in and for us, then are we indeed, as
                            the Apostle says, “of all men most miserable!” </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Let us therefore, with a large hope for the future, and a cheerful
                            contentment with the present, be willing to leave the world in the hands
                            of God, knowing that He has given us what conditions and what
                            circumstances are best for us. Let us see all things in God, and let us
                            become in Him, as Plato says, “spectators of all time, and of all
                            existence.” And thus, in spite of the difficulties presented to us by
                            “all the evil that is done under the sun” we shall perceive that all
                            things will, nay must, come right in God’s own time; and the apparent
                            dualism of good and evil at last become a glorious unity of good. But
                            let us remember also that “the Kingdom of God cometh not with
                            observation;” and I would conclude my sermon with certain memorable
                            words spoken by Christ Himself, though unfortunately not to be found in
                            the Gospels, but preserved to us by Clement of Alexandria. “The Lord,”
                            Clement tells us, “being asked when His kingdom should come, said, When
                            two shall be one, and that which is without as that which is within, and
                            the male with the female—neither male nor female.”</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘—And now—’ (at the sound of this word the whole congregation rose
                        automatically to their feet),‘I will ask you,’ the Doctor went on after a
                        pause, ‘to conclude this morning’s service by doing what I trust I have
                        shown that all here may sincerely and honestly do. I mean, I will ask you to
                        recite after me the Apostles’ Creed.’ </p>
                    <p> This appeal took the whole congregation quite aback. But there was no time
                        for wonder. Dr. Jenkinson at once began; nor was his voice the only sound in
                        the theatre. Lady Ambrose, pleased, after all that she had heard the night
                        previous, to make public profession of her faith, especially in a place
                        where it could not be called in question, followed the Doctor audibly and
                        promptly; Miss Prattle followed Lady Ambrose; Lady Violet Gresham, who was
                        busy with one of her sleeve-links, followed Miss Prattle; Lady Grace, from
                        quite another part of the house, followed Dr. Jenkinson on her own account;
                        Mr. Stockton repeated the first clause in a loud voice, and then relapsed
                        into marked silence; Mr. Luke only opened his lips to sigh out audibly in
                        the middle a disconsolate ‘Heigh ho!’ Mr. Storks blew his nose with singular
                        vigour through the whole proceeding; Mrs. Sinclair, just towards the end,
                        tapped Leslie’s arm gently with her fan, and said to him in a whisper, ‘Do
                        you really believe all this?’ </p>
                    <p> When all was over, when the Doctor had solemnly pronounced the last ‘Amen,’
                        he looked about him nervously for a moment, as if the question of how to
                        retire becomingly suddenly dawned upon him. Luckily he perceived almost
                        directly a servant standing in readiness by the curtain. The Doctor frowned
                        slightly at the man; made a slightly impatient gesture at him; and Faust and
                        the young witch again covered the preacher from the eyes of his
                        congregation. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p> The blinds were half-down at luncheon in the dining-room, to keep out the
                        brilliant summer sun. The guests dropped in by ones and twos, somewhat tired
                        and exhausted by the divine service of the morning; and the sight of the
                        table was not a little refreshing to them, as it shone whitely in the soft
                        gloom, with its flowers and ferns, and its day-lit glimmer of glass and
                        silver. Soon, however, a piece of news was circulated that was even more
                        refreshing than the luncheon. Dr. Jenkinson, owing to his late exertions,
                        and the gas-light, and the draughts upon the stage, was suffering from a
                        headache, which inclined him to keep his room; and accordingly an unhopedfor
                        prospect of freely discussing the sermon dawned brightly upon the whole
                        party. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Stockton, who had been much struck with the strictly prosaic style of
                        Dr. Jenkinson’s discourse, and who had been secretly contrasting this with
                        the more impassioned character of his own mind, was the first to begin. </p>
                    <p> ‘The sermon was perhaps ingenious,’ he said, turning to Lady Ambrose, ‘but
                        I’m afraid our friend’s forte is certainly not poetry.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Surely,’ said Donald Gordon with extreme solemnity of manner and only a
                        slight twinkle in his eye, ‘his forte is something far better. Poetry can
                        only make us happy for a little while. Such doctrines as we have heard this
                        morning ought to make us happy always.’ </p>
                    <p> As for Lady Ambrose, to whom both these remarks were addressed, she was in
                        doubt what altogether to think of the matter. More than half her heart
                        inclined her to look upon Dr. Jenkinson as a valuable ally; but there was
                        yet, all the while, a fatal something that whispered to her a vague distrust
                        of him. She was therefore waiting anxiously to hear what would be said by
                        others, before taking any side herself; her mind all the while being busy
                        with the profoundest questions. This suspense of judgment produced a certain
                        gravity and depression in her, which was visible on her face, and which
                        seemed to communicate itself to nearly everyone at her end of the table. For
                        Lady Ambrose was a communicative woman. Her spirits, good or bad, were
                        generally caught by those near her. As for Mr. Herbert, however, no one else
                        seemed needed to depress him. Low, slow, and melancholy, his accents at once
                        caught the ear of Lady Ambrose. </p>
                    <p> ‘I have heard to-day,’ he said to Mrs. Sinclair, who was sitting next him,
                        ‘an entirely new and in every way memorable doctrine, which I never heard
                        before from the mouth of man, woman, or child; nor can I tell by what steps
                        any human being could have arrived at it. I have heard that the world—the
                        world as it is—could not be better than it is; that there is no real sorrow
                        in it— no real evil—no real sin.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Poor Dr. Jenkinson!’ said Mrs. Sinclair, also in a melancholy voice; ‘I
                        suppose he has never loved.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ exclaimed Mr. Stockton,—his voice was melancholy as well—‘the whole
                        teachings of that school have always seemed to me nothing more than a few
                        fragments of science imperfectly understood, obscured by a few fragments of
                        Christianity imperfectly remembered.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You forget,’ said Leslie, ‘that Dr. Jenkinson’s Christianity is really a
                        new firm trading under an old name, and trying to purchase the goodwill of
                        the former establishment.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose, who had not liked Leslie so much on further acquaintance as
                        she had at first expected she should, was very indignant at him for so
                        flippant a speech as this—she felt sure it was flippant, though she did not
                        quite understand its meaning—but once again Mr. Herbert’s grave accents
                        arrested her. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is simply,’ he was saying to Mrs. Sinclair, evidently alluding to the
                        same subject—‘it is simply our modern atheism trying to hide its own
                        nakedness, for the benefit of the more prudish part of the public, in the
                        cast grave-clothes of a Christ who, whether he be risen or no, is very
                        certainly, as the angel said, not here.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘All discussion of such matters seems to me but a diseased activity,’ said
                        Mr. Rose, raising languidly a white deprecating hand. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Storks too, though for different reasons, was apparently of the same
                        opinion. </p>
                    <p> ‘In his main points,’ he said with a severe dogmatism that seemed designed
                        to end all further controversy, ‘and putting aside his quasi-religious
                        manner of expressing it—which considering his position may be pardoned—I
                        conceive Dr. Jenkinson to have been entirely right.’ </p>
                    <p> Hitherto Lady Ambrose’s views had been wavering to and fro, in a sad
                        uncertainty. But now her mind at once cleared. Her worst suspicions of the
                        Doctor were confirmed by this fatal commendation. The gloom on her face
                        deepened, and she had a look almost of distress about her as she turned to
                        Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘You look tired,’ he said to her. </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Lady Ambrose wearily: ‘at least, perhaps I am a little. Do you
                        know, I always think one feels rather dull if one doesn’t get the letters
                        one expects.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Perhaps you don’t know,’ said Laurence, ‘that the letters you got this
                        morning were only those of last night’s post. Our Sunday letters we are
                        obliged to send for, and they don’t generally come till later on in the
                        day.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Really!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, with surprise, as a smile slowly spread
                        over her face, and her frank eyes lit up again. ‘The Duchess couldn’t have
                        forgotten it,’ she said to herself half-consciously. Strangely enough, a new
                        warmth, it seemed, had dawned upon her, and her ice-bound gloom began to
                        thaw—to thaw only, however, not to evaporate. It did not go; it only became
                        voluble. </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you know, Mr. Laurence,’ she began, ‘I have been thinking over and over
                        again about many of the things that were said last night; and I really am
                        afraid that the world is getting very bad. It is very sad to think so; but,
                        with all this infidelity and wickedness of which we hear so much, I’m afraid
                        it is true. For my own part, you know, there is nothing I dislike so much as
                        to hear the Bible profanely spoken about; though, of course, I know one is
                        tempted sometimes to make jokes out of it oneself. And then,’ Lady Ambrose
                        added—her ideas did not always follow one another in the strictest
                        order—‘hardly a week passes without some new scandal. I had a letter only
                        this morning, telling me all the particulars about Colonel Eardly and poor
                        Lady Arthur. And that man, you know—just fancy it!—it will not be very long
                        before we shall be obliged to receive him again. However,’ said Lady
                        Ambrose, with a slightly more cheerful accent, ‘that sort of thing, I
                        believe, is confined to us. The middle classes are all right—at least, one
                        always hears so.’ </p>
                    <p> At this moment Lord Allen’s voice was heard. </p>
                    <p> ‘But now,’ Lady Ambrose went on to Laurence, very slightly moving her head
                        in the direction of Lord Allen, and speaking in a low tone, ‘how different
                            <hi>he</hi> is!’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose had the greatest admiration for Lord Allen, though her
                        acquaintance with him had hitherto been of the slightest; and Laurence, not
                        knowing how to respond to all her late remarks, was glad that her attention
                        was thus called elsewhere. </p>
                    <p> ‘Don’t you think,’ Allen was saying, half addressing himself to Mr. Herbert,
                        half to Mr. Luke, ‘that though at the present moment things as they are may
                        be worse than they have ever been before, there are yet ideas amongst us of
                        things as they might be, that are in advance of what has ever been before? I
                        know quite well how society is falling to pieces, and how all our notions of
                        duty are becoming confused or lost. I know too how utterly without any
                        religion we are’—(Lady Ambrose started)— ‘at least, any religion that one
                        man can express to another, and that can enable men to act in concert. But
                        still, I can’t help feeling that, in spite of all this, a higher class of
                        conceptions both of religion and morality, and social relations also, is
                        forming itself in the minds of thinking men.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Perfectly true, Lord Allen,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘perfectly true! It is indeed
                        the very essence of the cultured classes to be beyond their time—to have,
                        indeed, every requisite for making everything better, except the practical
                        power. As you say, what man’s life ought to be—what true morality is—what is
                        true sense, and what is true nonsense—these are matters never at any time
                        distinguished so truly as by some of us in the latter half of the nineteenth
                        century. Only, unfortunately,’ said Mr. Luke, sighing slowly, and looking
                        round the table, ‘the dense ignorance of the world at large hampers and
                        hinders such men as these, so that all that their teaching and their insight
                        can do, is only to suggest a Utopia in the future, instead of leading to any
                        reality in the present.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘All <hi>my</hi> happiness is in a kind of Utopia,’ sighed Mrs. Sinclair. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes—yes,’ said Mr. Luke wearily; ‘so in these days must be the happiness of
                        all of us—except that of the world at large.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Storks was here heard clearing his throat. With an ominous pugilistic
                        smile he turned towards Mr. Luke. </p>
                    <p> ‘Are you quite sure,’ he said, ‘that the reason why your friends do nothing
                        practical is not because they will build Utopias? I, as I have already said,
                        entirely hold with Dr. Jenkinson that the world is as good as it can be—has,
                        indeed, been always as good as it could have been—has, that is, been always
                        persistently progressing by one constant course of evolution. I don’t myself
                        profess to be a student of history; but, as far as I at all understand its
                        teachings, the one thing it most clearly shows to us is, that what strikes a
                        superficial observer as simply the decadence of old orders of things, is
                        really, under the surface, the birth of the new. Indeed,’ said Mr. Storks,
                        shrugging his shoulders, ‘of course it must be so. We are all part of
                        Nature; and, little as we think it, we are all working together by
                        invincible and inviolable laws. Nature will have her own way; and those who
                        have studied her carefully know that her way is always the best. Even
                        supposing we could transplant ourselves into some different, some more
                        advanced state of society, my dear sir, do you think we should be any
                        happier there? As much happier, I suppose, as you or I should be if we were
                        translated into the heaven our nurses used to tell us of, where nothing was
                        done but to sing Tate and Brady’s psalms with the angels to all eternity.
                        The air of our own age is the only air fit for us. In any other we should
                        languish.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I languish in this,’ said Mr. Luke, looking up to the ceiling. </p>
                    <p> Scarcely were the words out of his mouth than Mr. Saunders exclaimed, in his
                        most excited and shrillest voice, ‘I deny it—I entirely deny it!’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke was thunderstruck. Even Mr. Storks was taken aback by the audacity
                        of the contradiction; and as for the rest of the company, they could not
                        conceive where on earth Mr. Saunders had left his manners. Mr. Storks,
                        however, was still more astonished, and still less pleased, when he
                        discovered, as Mr. Saunders proceeded, what was the real meaning of his
                        speech. </p>
                    <p> ‘I entirely deny,’ Mr. Saunders went on, ‘that the ways of Nature are the
                        best ways. The belief that they are so is of all faiths the one that most
                        obviously contradicts experience. Did I accept this, I could accept
                        anything—Transubstantiation even. I should literally feel that I had no
                        right to condemn any doctrine because it was groundless, gratuitous, and
                        absurd. This faith in the goodness of Nature—why, that it <hi>is</hi> a
                        faith, is not that enough to condemn it? What but faith, let me ask, has
                        enslaved and stunted the world hitherto? And this particular faith, I would
                        remind you, which you flatter yourself will oppose religion, has been in
                        most cases its child, and is always ready to be its parent. I on the
                        contrary maintain that, far from being the best, Nature is the most odious
                        of things —that the whole universe is constructed on the most hateful
                        principles; in fact, that out of the primordial atoms only one thing has
                        developed itself in which the good outweighs the evil; and that is the one
                        thing that is usually opposed to Nature—man, and the reason of man.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Storks turned sharply round, and, with an awful look in his eyes of
                        contemptuous indignation, stared Mr. Saunders into silence. He held him
                        fixed in this way for a few moments, and then said to him in a voice of grim
                        unconcern, ‘May I trouble you for the mustard.’ Then again turning to Mr.
                        Luke, ‘You see,’ he proceeded, ‘what I take to be civilisation—indeed, the
                        whole duty of man— is the gradual self-adaptation of the human organism to
                        its environment—an adaptation which must take place, and any attempts to
                        hinder which are simply neither more nor less than disease. Progress, which
                        it is our highest life to further, is a thing that will continue despite the
                        opposition of individuals. Its tendencies are beyond the control of
                        individuals, and are to be sought in the spirit of the age at large,—not—if
                        you will forgive me the word—in the crotchets of this or that thinker. And
                        it seems to me to be the hopeful and distinguishing feature of the present
                        day, that men are learning generally to recognise this truth—that they are
                        learning not to cry out against progress, but to investigate its grand and
                        inevitable laws, and submit themselves willingly to them. And the tendency
                        of our own day is, I am proud to say, a tendency towards firm, solid,
                        verifiable knowledge, and as a result of this, towards the acquisition of a
                        firm and solid happiness also.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘To me,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘it seems rather that the only hope for the
                        present age lies in the possibility of some individual wiser than the rest
                        getting the necessary power, and in the most arbitrary way possible putting
                        a stop to this progress—utterly stamping out and obliterating every general
                        tendency peculiar to our own time. Mr. Storks will perhaps think me very
                        foolish. Perhaps I am. I freely own that I could more easily tell a good
                        action, if I saw it, than a good piece of protoplasm, and that I think the
                        understanding of a holy moral law, by which an individual may live, of
                        infinitely more importance than the discovery of all the laws of progress in
                        the world. But let Mr. Storks despise me, and not be angry with me—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear sir,’ interposed Mr. Storks, with a gruff courtesy, ‘why should I
                        do either the one or the other?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Because,’ said Mr. Herbert, slightly waving his hand, and speaking with
                        great emphasis, ‘had I only the power, I would myself put a forcible stop to
                        all this evolution. I would make a clean sweep of all the improvements that
                        the present day so much vaunts. I would collect an army of strong,
                        serviceable, honest workmen, and send them to blow up Manchester, and
                        Birmingham, and Liverpool, and Leeds, and Wolverhampton—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And all the artisans in them?’ asked Mr. Storks. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Mr. Herbert, smiling, ‘I would, perhaps, give the artisans
                        notice of this gunpowder plot of mine. And yet their existence has always
                        presented a painful difficulty to me. For if there is no other life, I think
                        they have a very bad time of it here; and if there is another life, I think
                        that they will all certainly be damned. But it is not only Manchester and
                        Birmingham that I would blow up. I would blow up also every anatomical
                        museum in the land, save such as were absolutely necessary for the use of
                        professional doctors, that the foul sights in them should not taint men’s
                        imaginations, and give them an appetite for beastly knowledge. I would
                        destroy every railway, and nearly every steam-engine; and I would do a
                        number of other things of a like sort, by way of preparing the ground for a
                        better state of society. Indeed, so far am I from believing that an entirely
                        different and better state of society is unthinkable, that I believe it to
                        be not impracticable; and I am at the present moment collecting money, from
                        such as will here and there confide in me, for the purpose of purchasing
                        land, and of founding a community upon what seem to me to be true and
                        healthful principles—a Utopia, in fact—in which I trust may be once again
                        realised upon earth those two things to which we are now such
                        strangers—order and justice.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I once began a book about justice,’ said Laurence, ‘on the model of Plato’s
                        Republic.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What is Plato’s Republic?’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘Tell me.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It is a book,’ said Laurence, ‘which describes the meeting of a party of
                        friends, who fell discussing high topics just as we are doing, and, amongst
                        others, What is justice?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose. ‘Did not they know that?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You forget,’ said Laurence,’ that this was very long ago.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘To be sure,’ said Lady Ambrose; ‘and they were of course all heathens.
                        Well— and what conclusions did they come to as to the nature of justice?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘At first,’ said Laurence,’ though Socrates himself was amongst them, they
                        were all completely at a loss how to define it. But at last they hit upon
                        the notion of constructing an ideal perfect state, in which of course
                        justice would be lurking somewhere. Now there are in life, Plato says, four
                        great virtues— wisdom, courage, temperance, and justice; and no sooner has
                        the ideal state been constructed, than it appears that three of these
                        virtues are specially illustrated and embodied, each in a particular class
                        of citizens. Thus, wisdom is specially embodied in the theoretical
                        politicians and religious speculators of the day; courage is embodied in the
                        practical men who maintain and execute the regulations and orders of the
                        philosophers; and temperance is embodied in the commercial and industrial
                        classes, who loyally submit themselves to their betters, and refrain from
                        meddling in matters that are too high for them. And now, where is justice?
                        In what class is that embodied specially?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘In the judges and the magistrates and the policemen,’ said Lady Ambrose. </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Laurence; ‘it is peculiar to no class. It resides in all. It is
                        that virtue which enables the others to exist and to continue.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But surely,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘all that is not what we mean by justice
                        now?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Certainly not,’ said Laurence; ‘and my book was designed to investigate
                        what justice is, as it exists now. I, like Plato, constructed a state,
                        making it, however, a real rather than an ideal picture. But when I had done
                        this, I could find no earnest thinking class to represent wisdom; no class
                        of practical politicians that would carry out even the little wisdom they
                        knew, and so represent courage; and certainly no commercial or industrial
                        class that would refrain for a single day from meddling in matters that were
                        too high for them, and so represent temperance. So I analysed life in a
                        somewhat different way. I divided it into happiness, misery, and justice. I
                        then at once discovered that the rich represented all the happiness of which
                        we are now capable, and the poor all the misery; and that justice was that
                        which set this state of things going and enabled it to continue.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, Laurence,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert, clapping his hands gently in sad
                        applause, ‘I like that. I wish you had worked out this idea more fully.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Suppose,’ exclaimed Leslie, ‘that we try this afternoon to construct a
                        Utopia ourselves. Let us embody our notions of life as it ought to be in a
                        new Republic.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘I am not a Conservative; I don’t object. I’m
                        sure at any rate that there is much we could all of us alter, if we only had
                        our own way.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Much,’ said Lady Grace, with severe briskness. </p>
                    <p> ‘Much,’ said Miss Merton, with a soft, half-serious smile. </p>
                    <p> ‘Much,’ said Lord Allen, catching eagerly at the idea. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, then,’ said Laurence, ‘let us all do our best to give those airy
                        somethings, our aspirations, a local habitation and a name.’ </p>
                    <p> The majority of the company took very kindly to the proposal. Lady Grace was
                        especially pleased, as it seemed to provide at once a whole afternoon’s
                        occupation for the party; and it was arranged accordingly that as soon as
                        luncheon was over they should adjourn for castle-building to a shady spot in
                        the garden. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p> GUIDED by Lady Grace, the guests gradually converged after luncheon towards
                        the appointed spot, straggling thither by various ways, and in desultory
                        groups; passing down broad flights of steps flanked by gods and goddesses,
                        and along straight terraces set with vases and Irish yews; while busts of
                        orators, poets, and philosophers, with Latin inscriptions, glimmered to
                        right and left of them in groves of laurels; and scaly Tritons, dappled with
                        green lichens, spouted up water in the middle of gleaming basins. Everything
                        was today looking at its loveliest. There was an unusual freshness in the
                        warm summer air. Beyond the green shrubs the sea shone bright and blue; and
                        through the shrubs the sea-breeze moved and whispered. </p>
                    <p> Laurence strolled slowly on behind with Miss Merton, choosing a path which
                        none of the others had taken. </p>
                    <p> ‘How delicious this is!’ said Miss Merton, lifting her hat to enjoy the
                        breeze upon her forehead. ‘Nobody could be in bad spirits in a place like
                        this. There is something so fresh and living everywhere, and even when we
                        lose sight of the sea we still hear it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Laurence. ‘I believe these gardens are like Keats’s island.
                        There is no recess in them </p>
                    <p>
                        <quote>Not haunted by the murmurous sound of waves.’</quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘And how perfectly everything is kept! What gardeners you must have!’ said
                        Miss Merton, as they turned up a narrow winding-walk, thickly set on either
                        side with carefully-trimmed laurels. </p>
                    <p> The whole place was, indeed, as Miss Merton said, kept perfectly. Not a weed
                        was on the grey gravel; not a single twig called for pruning. Every vase
                        they passed was full of the most delicious flowers. Overhead the branches of
                        limes and of acacia-trees murmured gaily. Everything seemed to be free from
                        care, and to be laughing, light of heart, in the bright weather. </p>
                    <p> ‘I am taking you this way,’ said Laurence, ‘because I want to show you what
                        I think may perhaps interest you.’ </p>
                    <p> As he spoke these words, a sudden bend in the walk brought them face to face
                        with something that gave Miss Merton a sudden sensation of surprise. It was
                        a small classical portico built in a style of the most severe simplicity,
                        through which by an iron gate one passed into an open space beyond. What
                        surprised Miss Merton on seeing this was the singular sense of desolation
                        and dreariness that seemed all at once to come over her. The iron gates
                        before her were a mass of rust; the portico, which had once been white, was
                        weather-stained into a dismal grey; the stone, too, it was built of was
                        scaling off in almost every place, and the fragments lay unheeded as they
                        had fallen upon the ground. Here, amongst everything that spoke of the
                        utmost care, was one object that spoke of entire forgetfulness and neglect.
                        They approached in silence, and Miss Merton looked in through the bars of
                        the rusty gate. The scene that met her eyes was one of greater desolation
                        still. It was a circular plot of ground, fenced round by a low stone wall
                        that was surmounted by spiked railings. It looked as though it might have
                        been once a flower garden, but it was now a wilderness. Outside its boundary
                        rose the rare and beautiful trees of the happy tended shrubberies. Inside
                        were nettles, brambles, and long weedy grass. Nothing else was visible in
                        this melancholy enclosure but three cypresses, apparently of various ages,
                        the two smaller planted near together, the third, and by far the largest,
                        standing apart by itself. </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton was quite at a loss what to make of the strange spot; and, as
                        Laurence was feeling in his pocket for the key, she asked him if it had
                        anything to do with breeding pheasants. </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you see what is written above the gate?’ said Laurence, as he pointed to
                        a dim inscription whose letters still retained a glimmer of fading gold;
                        ‘can you read it? <quote><l>  Neque harum, quas colis, arborum</l><l> Te,
                                præter invisam cupressum,</l></quote> “Of all these trees which you
                        love so, the hated cypress only shall follow its master, and be faithful to
                        him in his narrow house.” But come—let us go inside, if you are not afraid
                        of the long grass.’ </p>
                    <p> They passed through the gate, which gave a low wail upon its hinges, and
                        Miss Merton followed Laurence, knee-deep in grass and nettles, to the
                        smallest of the three cypress-trees. There Laurence paused. At the foot of
                        the tree Miss Merton saw a flat slab of marble, with something written upon
                        it; and for the first time she felt certain that she must be in a place of
                        graves. </p>
                    <p> ‘This,’ said Laurence, pointing to the little cypress, ‘was planted only
                        five years ago, ten clays before the poor old man died who now sleeps under
                        it. This is my uncle’s grave. Do you see the inscription? </p>
                    <p>
                        <quote><l> Omnis moriar, nullaque pars mei</l></quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> “I shall wholly die, and there is no part of me that will escape the Venus
                        of death.” That, and that alone, he chose to have written over him.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence spoke with some feeling, but Miss Merton was so much surprised that
                        she hardly knew what response to make. </p>
                    <p> ‘And does nobody take any care of this place?’ at last she said. </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Laurence. ‘By his own last orders, nobody. But come—you must look
                        at this too.’ And he motioned her towards the neighbouring cypress. </p>
                    <p> At the foot of this, almost hidden by the long grass, Miss Merton saw
                        something that surprised her still more strangely. It was the statue of a
                        woman half reclining in a languid attitude on a block of hewn marble. The
                        figure was full and beautiful, and the features of the face were singularly
                        fine; but there was something in the general effect that struck one at the
                        first moment as not pleasing. What slight drapery there was, was disposed
                        meretriciously over the rounded limbs; on the arms were heavy bracelets; one
                        of the hands held a half-inverted wine-cup, and the other was laid
                        negligently on a heap of coins. But what jarred most upon the feelings was
                        the face, with its perfect features. For a cold sneer was fixed upon the
                        full mouth and the fine nostrils; and the eyes, with a leer of petulant
                        sensuality, seemed to be fixed for ever upon the flat neighbouring
                        gravestone. </p>
                    <p> ‘This cypress,’ said Laurence, ‘is much older than the other. It was planted
                        twenty years ago; and twenty years ago the original of that statue was laid
                        beneath it. She was one of those many nameless ladies—for, as you know, he
                        completely exiled himself from society all the latter part of his life—who
                        from time to time shared his fortunes at the house here. She was, too, by
                        far the loveliest. She was at the same time the hardest, the most selfish,
                        the most mercenary as well. And he knew it too. In spite of the distraction
                        he found in her companionship, he was never for a moment deceived about her.
                        At last, having made a fortune out of him, she was thinking of leaving him.
                        But one day, suddenly, she caught a chill and died. She died here, and here
                        she was buried. That statue, as you may imagine, is his design not hers. The
                        attitude, the drapery, the wine-cup held in one hand, and the money in the
                        other, are according to his express direction; and by his direction, too,
                        that face, with its lovely features, leers and sneers at him for ever, as he
                        rests in his neglected grave. See, too, there is the epitaph which he chose
                        for her:— <quote><l> Lusisti satis, edisti satis, atque bibisti;</l></quote>
                        “You have wantoned enough with me—you have eaten enough of my substance—you
                        have drunk enough of my champagne; ’tis high time for you to go.” And now,’
                        said Laurence, ‘let us come to the third tree, and you shall see what is
                        overshadowed by it.’ </p>
                    <p> They passed across the enclosure to the largest of the three cypresses, and
                        at the foot of that Miss Merton discovered a third gravestone, also with a
                        poetical inscription. ‘That,’ said Laurence, ‘you can read without help of
                        mine.’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton looked; and the lines were not new to her:— </p>
                    <quote><l> A slumber did my spirit seal,</l><l>   I knew no mortal fears.</l><l>
                            She seemed a thing that could not feel</l><l>   The touch of earthly
                            years.</l><l> </l><l> She knows no motion now, nor force,</l><l>   She
                            neither feels nor sees,</l><l> Rolled round in earth’s diurnal
                            course</l></quote>
                    <p> ‘Here,’ said Laurence, ‘is the oldest grave of all. Its date is that of the
                        tree that stands beside it, and that was planted forty years ago. Under that
                        stone lies the only woman—except myself, almost the only thing—that the old
                        man ever really loved. This was in his young days. He was only thirty when
                        she died; and her death was the great turning-point of his life. She lived
                        with him for two years, in a little cottage that stood on the very spot
                        where he afterwards built the villa. She has no name, you see, on the
                        grave-stone, and I had best not give her any. She was some one’s wife, but
                        not his. That is her story. I have her miniature somewhere, which one day I
                        should like to show you. It is a lovely dark face, with liquid, spiritual
                        eyes, and under it are written two lines of Byron’s, which might have been
                        composed for her:— <quote><l> She walks in beauty like the night</l></quote>
                        Well, there she lies now; and the old man’s youth lies buried with her. It
                        was her death that made him a philosopher. He built this great place here,
                        and laid out these gardens half to kill his grief for her, and half to keep
                        alive her memory; and here, as you see, he buried her. She gave up all that
                        was best in her for the love of him. He gave up all that was best in him for
                        the loss of her.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And is this place left quite uncared for?’ said Miss Merton, looking around
                        her. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is left,’ said Laurence, ‘as he wished it should be. It was one of his
                        most special orders that, when he was dead and buried, no further care of
                        any kind should be spent on it. The grass and weeds were to be left to grow
                        wild in it, the rails to rust, the portico to decay and crumble. “Do you
                        think,” he said to me, “that I know so little of life as to flatter myself
                        that any single creature will regret me when I am gone, or even waste a
                        thought upon me? I do not chose, as Christians do, to rest for ever under a
                        lie; for their tombs are lying monuments that they are remembered; mine
                        shall be a true one that I am forgotten. Yes,” he said, “it makes me laugh
                        to think of myself—me, who have built this house and planted these gardens
                        which others will enjoy—rotting in the midst of it all. under thorns and
                        brambles, in a little dismal wilderness. And then perhaps, Otho,” he would
                        say to me, “some of your friends who will walk about these gardens in a year
                        or two—Christians, no doubt, with the devil knows what of fine sentiments
                        about faith and immortality—will look in through the bars of the gate, and
                        be shocked at that honest wilderness, that unconcealed neglect, which is the
                        only real portion of those that have been.” But during his last illness he
                        softened just a little, and admitted that I, he did believe, cared for him,
                        and might, when he was dead, every now and then think of him. “And so,” he
                        said, “if you like to do it, come every now and then, and scrape the moss
                        from my inscription, and from the two others. But that is all I will have
                        you do—that, and nothing more. That will express all that it is possible
                        that you should feel for me.” I promised him to do no more than that, and
                        that I do. Poor old man!’ Laurence went on meditatively, as they passed out
                        of the gates, and were again in the bright trim garden. ‘He thought that he
                        belonged to times before his own; but I think that in reality he belonged to
                        times after them. If he was Roman at all, as he always fancied himself, he
                        was Roman only in that sombre ennui that through all his later years
                        oppressed him; and which seems to me to be now settling down upon the
                        world—an ennui that always kept him seeking for pleasures, and that turned
                        the pleasures into ashes as soon as he possessed them. His pleasures were
                        high and low; but the higher made him despise the lower; and the lower he
                        sought simply that he might drown the higher. Two things only during his
                        last years never palled upon him: one was, saying a sharp thing neatly; the
                        other, detecting some new weakness in human nature. In this he seemed really
                        to revel. On the littlenesses and the pretences of men, especially when they
                        turned out failures, he seemed to look with a passionate contemptuous
                        fondness, like a wicked prince on a peasant-girl. See—here was his summer
                        study—this stone pavilion. Let us go in for a moment, and I will show it to
                        you.’ </p>
                    <p> They were in front of a small quasi-classical building of white marble,
                        embowered behind in arbutus and in myrtles, and commanding from its large
                        windows a full view of the sea. Laurence unlocked the door, and he and Miss
                        Merton entered. </p>
                    <p> Inside there was a faint musty smell, and a general sense that the place had
                        been long disused. The walls were completely lined with books in splendid
                        bindings, whose gilded backs glimmered temptingly through the network of the
                        bookcase doors. In the centre stood a table, covered with a cloth of faded
                        crimson velvet; nothing on it but a tarnished ormolu inkstand, in the shape
                        of a Roman temple, across the columns of which spiders had woven dusty webs.
                        Placed stiffly before the table stood a gilded arm-chair, with cushions of
                        crimson damask, and under it a foot-stool to match, which had been worn
                        quite bare by the old philosopher’s feet. </p>
                    <p> ‘Here,’ said Laurence, ‘he would sit day after day amongst his books,
                        drawing, or reading, or writing, or looking out at his flowers or at the
                        sea. Look! these two folios, bound in red morocco, are a collection of his
                        verses, letters, essays and so on, that he had had privately printed. They
                        are not all, I’m afraid, quite fit to read. But this first volume is all
                        right. I should like to take it out and show it to you by-and-by. But come—I
                        have nothing more to exhibit now. We had better join the others. They will
                        not be far off,’ he said, as they left the pavilion; ‘indeed, I think I can
                        hear them talking.’ </p>
                    <p> In another moment they had passed through an arch of evergreens, and found
                        themselves on the spot where nearly all the rest of the party had already
                        assembled, disposed in an easy group upon the grass. The place was an
                        amphitheatre of velvet turf, set round with laurels and all kinds of shrubs;
                        in the arena of which—if one may so speak—a little fountain splashed cool
                        and restless in a porphyry basin. Overhead the blue summer sky was screened
                        by the whispering shade of tall trees; and above the dark laurel-leaves the
                        fresh sea was seen in the distance, an azure haze full of sparklings. The
                        whole scene, as Miss Merton and Laurence, with his gorgeous folio under his
                        arm, came upon it, was curiously picturesque. The various dresses made
                        against the green turf a soft medley of colours. The ladies were in white
                        and black and pale yellow, green and crimson and dove-colour. All the men,
                        except Mr. Luke, were in shooting coats; and Mr. Saunders, who wore
                        knickerbockers, had even pink stockings. And here, as the lights and shades
                        flickered over them, and the gentle air breathed upon them, they seemed
                        altogether like a party from which an imaginative on-looker might have
                        expected a new Decameron. </p>
                    <p> Already, under Lady Grace’s vigorous guidance, a certain amount of talk had
                        begun <hi>àpropos</hi> of the new Republic; all the ladies, with the
                        exception of Mrs. Sinclair, having fallen to discussing the true position of
                        women, or rather of woman, and their opinions on this point being a little
                        various. But besides this, the post had arrived; and that too had created
                        some excitement. Lady Ambrose in particular had become delightfully radiant,
                        on receiving a large envelope that was stiff as she handled it; and which
                        she saw contained, as she just peeped into it, a card, on the top of which
                        was printed, <hi>‘To have the honour to meet—.’</hi> She had, too, just
                        extracted from Lord Allen a promise to come and stay with her, next autumn,
                        in the country; and her measure of good spirits was quite full. </p>
                    <p> ‘Now, Mr. Laurence,’ she exclaimed, dangling her hat in her hand, ‘do come
                        and put a stop to this. You see what a woman’s parliament would be if we
                        ever have one, which my husband says is not at all impossible. Here is one
                        of us who thinks that everything will go well if women can only learn to
                        paint flowers on white dessert plates, and get fifteen shillings apiece for
                        them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And I,’ said Lady Grace, smiling good-naturedly, ‘was just saying that they
                        all ought to be taught logic.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Perfectly true,’ exclaimed Mr. Saunders, putting up his spectacles to see
                        who had spoken. </p>
                    <p> ‘And Miss Merton,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘thinks that we should all be taught
                        to walk the hospitals, or be sick-nurses.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I should not so much mind that,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, ‘in war time, if one
                        had anyone fighting in whose life one really took an interest. I once
                        thought, Mr. Leslie, that that might be my mission, perhaps.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘how are we to build a castle in the air together,
                        if we are all at cross purposes like this?’ </p>
                    <p> There did indeed seem little prospect of their getting to work at all; until
                        Leslie exclaimed at last that he thought he had found a way. </p>
                    <p> ‘See,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, ‘I told you a little while ago you would be
                        wanted to talk cleverly. And now, Mr. Leslie, don’t you think you would be
                        more comfortable if you sat a little farther off? or Lady Grace, of whom I
                        am already afraid, will begin to think we’re flirting.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Leslie, ‘in spite of all our differences, I think I see a way
                        in which we shall all be able to set to work together. We want to imagine a
                        state that shall be as nearly perfect as we can make it. Well and good. Now,
                        we shall all admit, I suppose, that in a perfect state all the parts will be
                        perfect, and each part will imply and involve all the others. Given one
                        bone, we shall be able to construct the entire animal. Let us then take one
                        part, and imagine that first. Let us take the highest class in our state,
                        and see what we think that ought to be, looking on it in the first place not
                        as a corporate body of superiors, but as an assembly of equals. Let us, I
                        mean, to put it in other words, begin with seeing what we really wish
                        society to be—what we really think that the highest and most refined life
                        consists in, that is possible for the most favoured classes; and then let us
                        see afterwards what is implied in this.’ </p>
                    <p> Leslie’s proposal was welcomed eagerly by everyone. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘and so we are each of us to say, are we, what we
                        think is the essence of good society? Come then, who knows?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Art,’ murmured Mr. Rose. </p>
                    <p> ‘Reason,’ said Mr. Saunders. </p>
                    <p> ‘Unworldliness, based on knowledge of the world,’ said Miss Merton. </p>
                    <p> ‘Wait a moment,’ said Laurence, ‘we are going too fast. This is not what Mr.
                        Leslie means.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘No, no,’ said Mr. Saunders. ‘Let us get rid of what is evil before we
                        introduce what is good. I should begin by getting rid of every belief that
                        is not based upon reason, and every sentiment whose existence cannot be
                        accounted for.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Here we are,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘all over the place. Now if I might be
                        allowed to say what I thought was the essence of good society, I should say
                        that a great part of it, at least, was the absence of dull and vulgar
                        people.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Excellent!’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, ‘and a capital exclusion with which to
                        begin our new Republic.’ </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                    <p> ‘YES,’ said Mr. Luke still more solemnly, ‘if we only follow this out—this
                        idea of the exclusion from our society of all vulgar and extraneous
                        elements, we shall find we have done a great deal more than we may at first
                        think. We shall have at once a free, and liberal, and untainted social and
                        intellectual atmosphere, in which our thoughts, and feelings, and
                        refinements, and ways of living, may develop themselves to the utmost,
                        unimpeded. Lady Ambrose has certainly begun with hitting the right nail on
                        the head.’ </p>
                    <p> Could Lady Ambrose have been told, when she left London the afternoon
                        before, that in another twenty-four hours she would be taking the lead in
                        the construction of a Utopia, or ideal state of society, suggested by the
                        writings of a Greek philosopher, she would have been utterly at a loss to
                        know what the prophecy meant; and had she known what it meant, she would
                        certainly not have believed it. Indeed, as it was, she could hardly imagine
                        that Mr. Luke was serious, and that he was not laughing at her; so she said
                        quickly and in a tone of self-defence, </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course I know that there must be something more than the mere exclusion
                        of vulgar people, Mr. Luke. We must have religion, and all that, and—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, interrupting her with a grand wave of the hand;
                        ‘my dear Lady Ambrose, let us leave all that till by-and-by. Let us be
                        content to begin with simpler matters first.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Let us begin with the flowers of life,’ said Leslie, ‘and when we have
                        chosen these, let us trace them back to their roots.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I quite think,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that in a really good society—one that
                        was perfectly good even in the superficial sense of the word—we should find,
                        if we only had eyes enough, religion lurking somewhere, and everything else
                        we want.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And so that’s <hi>your</hi> view, my dear, is it?’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘Oh,
                        then, I suppose since you, a Roman Catholic, think so, I may also.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Surely, too,’ said Miss Merton, ‘we must all know that nothing can be so
                        bad, either for the pushers or the pushed, as the struggle of people to get
                        into what they think is good society, not in the least because they care to
                        be there, but merely because they care to be known to be there.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose, who perhaps felt unconsciously some small pricks of conscience
                        here, again looked doubtful, and said, ‘Still, if we really want to make a
                        perfect state, this does not seem a very serious thing to begin with.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Listen,’ exclaimed Laurence; ‘let me read you something I have
                        here—something of my uncle’s, which I have just thought of. It is a short
                        adaptation of Aristotle’s <hi>Ethics</hi>.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose started. Hearing two words, the one as long as
                            <hi>Aristotle</hi>, and the other as unfamiliar as <hi>Ethics</hi>, she
                        began to think that she had made the conversation serious with a vengeance.
                        Indeed, the whole party, as well as herself, showed some signs of surprise. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is very short,’ said Laurence, ‘and I will only read a page or two. It
                        is called “A system of Ethics, adapted from Aristotle, for the use of the
                        English Nation.” It was suggested to him—’ (and this bewildered Lady Ambrose
                        still more, though at the same time it gave her some gleam of hope), ‘by a
                        very rich vulgar family, who bought a place near here, and who much annoyed
                        and amazed him by the great court they paid to him. This is the first
                        chapter; it treats of “<hi>The</hi> Summum Bonum, <hi>or The Moral End of
                            Action</hi>.” Listen— </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Ethics being the art and science of human action, as directed towards
                            the chief good of life—that highest and final end, to which, if we think
                            a little, we shall see all other ends are subordinate; it is evident
                            that our first task must be, as our master Aristotle well says, to form
                            a clear conception of what this end, the chief good, is.</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Now on this point Aristotle would seem to err. For he, following the
                            common opinion of men, affirms the chief good to be happiness, holding
                            the only question to be, in what does true happiness lie? And if he had
                            been philosophising for savages, he would indeed have been in the right.
                            But because savages and men in a state of nature have all one end of
                            action, which is happiness, it by no means follows that the same is true
                            of civilised nations, and that these may not have ends that are far
                            higher. It is indeed evident tliat they have. And not this only, but
                            that of such ends there is a very great variety. To describe and number
                            these with anything like absolute accuracy is neither required nor
                            admitted by the nature of the subject. But we shall be sufficiently near
                            the truth if we say that there is a separate and characteristic chief
                            good for each civilised nation—(quot gentes tot summa bona)—and that it
                            is by this in each case that the national character is determined. A
                            glance at the continent of Europe will at once illustrate this, and
                            suggest examples to us of these national chief goods. We shall see the
                            Germans, for instance, following what is called Thought to its inmost
                            recesses, the French what is called Life. We shall find accordingly that
                            the chief good of the former nation, which is perhaps the highest of
                            all, is the knowledge of the unknowable; whilst that of the latter,
                            which is next to it in dignity, is the practice of the unmentionable.
                            And so on with all the other nations; each will be found to have its
                            separate chief good; and none of these to have the least connection with
                            happiness. For us, however, who are English, and writing for English
                            readers, it will be enough to concern ourselves simply with the chief
                            good of the English. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘We shall discover this, in the same way as we did that of the French
                            and Germans, in an examination of our own special national
                            characteristic. First, however, we must be clear what this
                            characteristic is; and here it will be well to take our neighbours’
                            opinions of us as well as our own. If we inquire then in what light we
                            present ourselves to the other European nations, we shall find that just
                            as the Germans are known mainly as a profound nation, and the French as
                            a prurient nation, so are we, in like manner, now known as a vulgar
                            nation. And as this view of us exactly tallies with our own, it appears
                            evident that the special national characteristic of the English is
                            vulgarity, and that the chief good of the English is the final end that
                            is aimed at by the English vulgar classes. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘This we affirm to be social distinction, to their admiration and
                            pursuit of which is due that cardinal moral quality which they call
                            worldliness in themselves, and snobbishness in their friends and
                            enemies. And if any object that to a great part of the nation social
                            distinction in its true sense is a thing unknown, and that to another
                            part it is a thing that comes without being struggled for, and so in
                            neither case can be the end of moral action, we shall answer them that
                            to object this, is much the same as to argue that a peach-tree does not
                            bear peaches because none are to be seen growing out of the roots; or
                            that there is no meaning in the Athanasian Creed because none is
                            attached to it by the only people who use it; or that there is no
                            meaning in the dogma of the Pope's infallibility because its only
                            possible meaning is repudiated by all those who defend it. For nothing
                            will be found unless we seek it in its right place. And for the ethics
                            of a nation we must look only in that part of the nation which is their
                            proper sphere; and that part is, as we have already shown, the vulgar
                            part. And should any still imagine that if we thus limit the scope of
                            our observation, we shall not be able to treat the subject exhaustively,
                            we shall remind him that the vulgar classes, though not yet co-extensive
                            with the nation, are still rapidly becoming so, vulgarity ascending and
                            descending with equal certainty; since on the one hand it ruins all
                            society into which it contrives to enter; whilst it thrives itself, on
                            the other hand, on all society that contrives to enter into it. To it
                            therefore our whole study may be confined. Nor lastly (for it is well to
                            anticipate every possible objection), is there any need that even thus
                            we should study those classes that naturally possess social distinction,
                            that we may so learn in what its real essence consists; since, if we do
                            but observe facts, we shall see that ignorance of the whole inner nature
                            of good society is the chief characteristic of those who with most
                            single-heartedness direct their lives towards getting into it. It will
                            be enough then, without any further explanation, to lay it down that
                            social distinction is the chief good, and the end of all moral action;
                            nor can the Aristotelians say that this is in reality a mediate end, and
                            sought for only because it leads to happiness; since so far are men from
                            seeking social distinction for the sake of happiness, that they are
                            perpetually renouncing happiness for the sake of social distinction.’

                    <p> ‘Capital, Mr. Laurence!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, breaking into a low silvery
                        laugh, as soon as Laurence had ended. ‘And how true that is about those
                        people who really ruin the society into which they contrive to push
                        themselves!’ </p>
                    <p> Lord Allen, who caught Miss Merton’s eye at this moment, gave a very faint
                        smile. </p>
                    <p> ‘So you see,’ said Laurence, ‘that you were quite right, Lady Ambrose, by
                        instinctively beginning with exclusion.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Still,’ said Allen, ‘I’m afraid that all this is rather selfish. These
                        people who want to to be so smart, are, I dare say, not much the worse
                        because of it. Indeed, myself, I rather like a good snob now and then.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘let me read a few more paragraphs, and you will see.
                            <hi>‘Such being the end,’</hi> he goes on, <hi>‘of all moral action,
                            virtue or morality is that state of mind which desires this end; and
                            virtuous or moral acts are those which help us on towards it, provided
                            only that they are done with purpose. For acts done not with purpose,
                            but by chance, are not to be held moral. Now the nature of purpose is
                            well explained by Aristotle, when he says that its object is all such
                            voluntary action as is the result of deliberation. And what then is the
                            object of deliberation? Let us consider that: for men, it is evident, do
                            not deliberate about all matters alike; since in addition to their
                            continually not deliberating in cases when they ought, there are many
                            matters about which deliberation is out of the question. Thus no one
                            deliberates about what is in its nature immutable, as how to alter
                            vulgarity of a people’s member of Parliament; nor about necessary
                            things, as how to alleviate the misery of the starving poor; nor about
                            things of chance, as how to prevent the dissemination of cholera; nor,
                            again, about remote things which do not concern us, as, to use a former
                            instance, how to alleviate the misery of the starving poor; nor does
                            anyone deliberate about impossible things, as how to check the poisonous
                            adulteration of food; nor about things that are past and lost, as how to
                            do anything for the glory of England; nor, lastly, do we deliberate
                            about things we do not care about, as how to get that lost glory back
                            again. Deliberation, then, only takes place about such matters as our
                            own agency can effect, and which we wish it should effect. Virtue,
                            therefore, being thus based on deliberation, is manifestly not one of
                            those things that come to us by nature whether we will or no; but it is
                            acquired by habit. The genus of moral virtue is a habit. But what
                            special sort of habit? and how does it differ from all other habits? Let
                            us consider this. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘We must remember, first, that it is the office of every virtue to
                            perfect that of which it is the virtue. Thus it is the virtue of a
                            modern London house to be as badly built as possible and not be seen to
                            be so; it is the virtue of an insured ship not to appear unseaworthy
                            before she does so to the crew as she is foundering; and it is the
                            virtue of butcher’s meat, groceries and so forth, not to appear unfit
                            for human consumption. In the same way moral virtue, or the virtue of a
                            man, is that which makes him appear to be one thing to the world, whilst
                            in reality he is another. Such being the case, it is plain that in
                            trying to be virtuous, we may, as in most other things, do too much, or
                            too little; and what is right will be a mean lying between these two
                            extremes. Now of means there are two kinds, the absolute and the
                            relative, either of which we can find in anything that is continuous;
                            the former, as when we take the bisecting point in a straight line,
                            which is for all men one and the same; the latter, as when we take the
                            mean point or thing with reference to ourselves, in which case it will
                            differ with our different requirements. Thus, if three be too small a
                            number, and seventy-five too great, simply as an arithmetical problem,
                            we take thirty-nine to be the mean, which exceeds three by as much as it
                            is exceeded by seventy-five; but with reference to ourselves we cannot
                            so decide. For thirty-nine articles of religion may be too few for the
                            present Archbishop of Westminster, and three may be too many for the
                            Dean. Or again between 100l. and 20l., the mean with regard to the
                            matter itself would be 60l., but with regard to ourselves, not so. For
                            60l. would be too little to offer to a cook, and too much to offer to a
                            curate. So in like manner that equality which constitutes moral virtue
                            is not the absolute, but the relative mean. Moral virtue, then, we shall
                            define to be a certain state, or habit of purpose, conforming in action
                            to the relative mean, and adjusted to that mean as the worldly or
                            snobbish man would adjust it. At this point we shall pause a moment to
                            make a very slight change in the accepted terminology of the subject. We
                            have hitherto spoken of the virtue of the vulgar classes as being a
                            mean. We consider, however, that our language will be less ambiguous, if
                            we take another form of the same word, and agree to call it a meanness.
                            Moral virtue, then, is a meanness lying between two vices, its extremes;
                            the one vice being that of excess, the other that of defect. Thus it is
                            possible for a habit of mind to be so unrestrained and vehement, that
                            the acts it produces at once betray their motives and obtrude them on
                            the observer; it is possible for it, also, on the other hand, to be so
                            weak and nerveless as never to produce any acts at all. For instance,
                            the habit of thought in a clergyman may be so strong and unrestrained as
                            to lead him to speak his whole conclusions out, and so get deprived of
                            his living; or on the other hand it may be so weak and undeveloped, that
                            he comes to no conclusions at all, and so dies in a curacy; the meanness
                            between these two extremes being what is called vagueness, or the
                            absence of any defined opinions, which is a great merit, and leads, in
                            the Established Church, to high preferment. So also with habits of
                            action, the general name given to the true meanness is worldliness,
                            whereof the excess is snobbishness, and the defect independence:
                            worldliness being in its essence the former of these, and in its aspect
                            the latter. Whence it follows that we may yet further generally define
                            the moral meanness, as that which is inwardly one extreme, and which is
                            outwardly the other.’</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘Now,’ said Laurence, ‘though I don’t suppose the writer of this really
                        cared two straws whether the majority of people were mean and vulgar or no,
                        there is a great deal of truth in what he says: and I think in our ideally
                        good society one of the first things we want is that it shall be unmixed and
                        genuine; I mean, all its members must be of it, as well as in it. They must
                        give it its <hi>prestige</hi>. We must have none that merely get their
                            <hi>prestige</hi> from it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Allen, ‘no doubt this exclusion is better, if it could be only
                        managed.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Don’t let us think yet,’ said Laurence, ‘about how to manage it. Let us see
                        what we want first, and see what it costs afterwards.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I certainly believe,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that what I consider the extremely
                        bad manners of a great many very fine ladies would all go, if a stop were
                        put to this jostling and scrambling that goes on about them, as Mr. Laurence
                        proposes.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘See,’ said Laurence, ‘here is one good fruit of exclusion at once—the
                        redemption of our manners; and a most important fruit too, I think; for I
                        hope we all start with the understanding that our society, ideally good as
                        it is, is above none of those outward graces and refinements of behaviour
                        and ways of living that give us such pleasure now, when we find them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And manner too, Mr. Laurence,’ broke in Lady Ambrose, ‘as well as
                        manners—Think what a charm there is in a really charming manner.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘There is indeed,’ exclaimed Mr. Stockton. ‘The dear Duchess of ——— for
                        instance—why, there’s a fascination even in the way in which she says good
                        morning.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah yes,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘Now, there’s what I call a <hi>really</hi>
                        perfect manner for you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Very well,’ said Laurence, ‘and whatever is a really perfect manner, in our
                        ideal society we must all have it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I must confess,’ said Allen, ‘that I get very sick sometimes of our
                        conventional society manners; and I often long to have a good genuine savage
                        to talk to.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That,’ said Laurence, ‘is because of all the social shams that we have just
                        agreed to get rid of. And to call the manner of society conventional,
                        conveys no greater blame than if you were to call language conventional. For
                        manner is but a second language, of which the best society speaks the purest
                        dialect—the Attic, in fact. And as with language, so with manner, the more
                        uniformity there is in it in some ways, the nicer shades of individuality
                        shall we be able to express by it in others.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Allen, shortly, ‘perhaps it is so. You are very likely right.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And in manner,’ said Laurence, ‘I include <hi>tone</hi> too—that special
                        and indescribable way of looking at things, and speaking of things, which
                        characterises good society, and distinguishes it from the rest of the world
                        so completely, and yet by marks so subtle that they would utterly escape the
                        notice of those who don’t know their meaning—that little extra stroke of
                        polishing that brings to light such countless new delicate veins in the
                        marble of life—the little extra stroke of the brush that puts a new
                        refinement, and self-possession, into the face. As Browning says of a very
                        different subject— <quote><l> Oh, the little more, and how much it
                            is,</l></quote> And this is something quite independent of any special
                        ability or special quality on the part of the individual people themselves;
                        though of course the more gifted and cultivated they are, the greater will
                        its charm be.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Miss Merton thoughtfully, and half to herself, ‘I think all that
                        is quite true.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course,’ said Laurence, ‘I know that tone alone can only make society
                        good in a very narrow sense of the word. I merely mean that no amount of
                        other qualities can make it really good, without tone.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t in the least object,’ said Allen, ‘to the marble being polished;
                        but what I want first to be sure of is, that it is worth polishing.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Quite so,’ said Laurence. ‘What we must now consider is, what are all those
                        special qualities and accomplishments, which will make a really perfect
                        society the best among the best—such things as wit, knowledge, experience,
                        humour, and so on—the veins, in fact, in the marble, that can be brought out
                        by the polish.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, yes, my dear Laurence,’ began Mr. Luke, ‘this is the great thing that
                        we shall have to decide about; and it is this very thing that I am always
                        telling the world is—’ </p>
                    <p> But he was interrupted by the advent of Mr. Herbert, who, with the exception
                        of Mr. Storks and Dr. Jenkinson, was the only member of the party not
                        already there. Mr. Herbert’s whole aspect surprised everyone. At luncheon,
                        as all remembered, he had been melancholy and desponding; but his face now
                        wore a bright smile, and there was something that was almost gaiety in his
                        elastic step. No one, however, ventured to ask him the reason of this
                        pleasing change; but as he held an open newspaper in his hand, which he had
                        apparently just received, it occurred to most that he must have seen in it
                        ‘something to his advantage.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ he exclaimed to Laurence, in a manner quite in keeping with his
                        look, ‘and tell me now how are you getting on with your new Republic? You
                        ought to make a very beautiful thing out of it—all of you together, with so
                        many charming ladies.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you think so?’ said Laurence, in great surprise at this cheerful view of
                        things. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ answered Mr. Herbert, slowly and with decision. ‘Ladies I always
                        think, so long as they are good and honest, have beautiful imaginations. And
                        now, let me ask you how you have set to work.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence explained to him that they had begun, on Leslie’s suggestion, with
                        considering what society, or the life of the highest classes, would be at
                        its best; and that they were going to see afterwards what was implied in
                        this. </p>
                    <p> ‘Indeed!’ said Mr, Herbert meditatively. ‘Now, that is a really beautiful
                        way of going about the business. And how far, let me ask you, have you got
                        with your picture of these highest classes? I trust at all events that you
                        have made a good beginning.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘A beginning,’ said Laurence, ‘is all that we have made. We have agreed that
                        our society is to have the utmost polish, ease, and grace of manner, and the
                        completest <hi>savoir-vivre</hi>. It is, in fact, to be a sort of exemplar
                        of human life at its highest conceivable completeness.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Excuse me,’ said Mr. Herbert, ‘but the ways of polite life, and the manners
                        of fine ladies and gentlemen, are beautiful only as the expression of a
                        beautiful spirit! They are altogether hateful as the ornament or the
                        covering of a vile one.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes, Herbert, yes,’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, with a long sigh. ‘And I was just
                        going to say this, when you joined us—that to make society really good—even
                        really brilliant and entertaining—one thing is wanted, and that is true and
                        genuine culture. <hi>Then</hi> let us have the polish by all means; but let
                        it be a diamond we polish, and not a pebble. Our society must be one that
                        does not merely dance, and hunt, and shoot. It must think, and reason, and
                        read. It must be familiar—the whole of it must be familiar—with the great
                        thoughts of the world, the great facts of the world, and the great books of
                        the world. You want all this, if you would be perfectly brilliant in your
                            <hi>salons</hi>, as well as really profound in your studies.’ </p>
                    <p> This was assented to by nearly all. Lady Ambrose however looked a little
                        uncomfortable, and not quite satisfied about something. </p>
                    <p> ‘Don’t you think,’ she said at last, ‘that if everyone is to have so much
                        culture, society will tend to become—well—just a little—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, Lady Ambrose?’ said Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, just a little bit <hi>blue</hi>. It will be all too bookish, if you
                        understand what I mean. Don’t you know when anyone comes to see you in
                        London, and will talk of nothing but books, one always fancies it is because
                        he isn’t—it’s very uncharitable to say so, but still it’s true—because he
                        isn’t very much in society and doesn’t know many people to talk about?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I always think it such a blessing,’ said Lord Allen, ‘to find anyone who
                        will talk about books, and will not be perpetually boring one with vulgar
                        gossip and scandal.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh, so do I,’ said Lady Ambrose eagerly, ‘but that was not what I meant
                        exactly. Mr. Laurence knows what I mean; I’m sure he does. No one can
                        delight in a book more than I; but still—’ she said, pausing to think how
                        much of what she considered culture was to be found in those London
                        drawing-rooms where she felt her own life completest, ‘still—somehow—’ she
                        said with a faint smile, ‘it is possible to be too literary, isn’t it, as
                        well as too anything else?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Perfectly true, Lady Ambrose,’ said Mr. Luke—Lady Ambrose was
                        delighted—‘people continually <hi>are</hi> too literary—to my cost I know
                        it; and that is because the world at large—what is called the reading world
                        even more than the non-reading world—are hopelessly at sea as to what books
                        are, and what they really do for us. In other words, if you will forgive my
                        harping as I do upon a single expression, they lack culture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Why, I thought culture <hi>was</hi> books and literariness, and all that,’
                        Lady Ambrose murmured half aloud, with a look of bewilderment. Mr. Herbert
                        however suddenly came to her rescue. </p>
                    <p> ‘Now, all this,’ he said, ‘is most interesting; but I feel myself, something
                        as I imagine Lady Ambrose does, that I should like to know a little more
                        clearly what culture is, and what you mean by it, when you call it the
                        essence of good society.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘this is just what I like. Come, Mr. Luke, suppose
                        you were to tell us.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Suppose,’ said Mr. Luke with an august wave of his hand, ‘instead of that
                        we ask Mr. Laurence to tell us. No one can do so better than he. I, Lady
                        Ambrose, have perhaps grown something too much of a specialist to be able to
                        put these things in a sufficiently popular way.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Herbert,’ this is really nice. I shall like to listen to
                        this. But you must allow me to be merely a listener, and not ask me for
                        instruction. I assure you I am here altogether to be instructed.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence, with some diffidence, assented to what was asked of him; and there
                        was a general rustling on all sides of the party settling themselves down
                        more luxuriously on the grass. Every influence of the summer afternoon
                        conspired to make all take kindly to the topic—the living airy whisper of
                        the leaves overhead, the wandering scents of the flowers that the breeze
                        just made perceptible, the musical splash of the fountain in its quiet
                        restlessness, the luxury of the mossy turf as soft as sleep or rose-leaves,
                        and a far faint murmur of church-bells that now and then invaded the ear
                        gently, like a vague appealing dream. Mr. Saunders even was caressed by his
                        flattered senses into peacefulness; the high and dry light of the intellect
                        ceased to scintillate in his eyes; the spirit of progress condescended to
                        take a temporary doze. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p> ‘AND now, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘begin at the beginning, please,
                        and don’t do as Lord Kennington did at the Eton and Harrow match the other
                        day—go talking to me about “overs,” and “long-stops,” and things like that,
                        before I was even quite sure of the difference between “out ”and “in.”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course,’ Laurence began, smiling with a little prefatory shyness, ‘we
                        can all understand the difference between a coarse common rustic palate,
                        like that of the burly farmer, for instance, who just enjoys food in a brute
                        way when he is hungry, and drink so long as it is spirituous at all times;
                        and the palate of the true epicure, that is sensitive to taste as the nicest
                        ear is to music, and can discriminate perfectly all the subtle semitones and
                        chords of flavour. Well, transfer this image from the mouth to the mind, and
                        there’s the whole thing in a nutshell. There is culture and no culture. A
                        person is really cultivated when he can taste not only the broad flavours of
                        life—gulping its joys and sorrows down, either with a vulgar grimace of
                        disgust, or an equally vulgar hearty voracity; but when with a delicate
                        self-possession he appreciates all the subtler taste of things, when he
                        discriminates between joy and joy, between sorrow and sorrow, between love
                        and love, between career and career; discerning in all incidents and
                        emotions their beauty, their pathos, their absurdity, or their tragedy, as
                        the case may be.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You mean, then,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that a man of the highest culture is a
                        sort of emotional <hi>bon vivant?</hi>’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That surely is hardly a fair way—’ began Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘Excuse me, my dear Laurence,’ broke in Mr. Luke, in his most magnificent of
                        manners, ‘it is perfectly fair—it is admirably fair. Emotional <hi>bon
                            vivant!</hi>’ he exclaimed. ‘I thank Miss Merton for teaching me that
                        word! for it may remind us all,’ Mr. Luke continued, drawing out his words
                        slowly, as if he liked the taste of them, ‘how near our view of the matter
                        is to that of a certain Galilean peasant—of whom Miss Merton has perhaps
                        heard—who described the highest culture by just the same metaphor, as a
                        hunger and a thirst after righteousness. Our notion of it differs only from
                        his, from the <hi>Zeitgeist</hi> having made it somewhat wider.’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton, in her inmost soul, did anything but return Mr. Luke’s
                        compliment, and consider his comment on her words as either admirably or
                        perfectly fair. However, she held her peace. The thoughts of Lady Ambrose
                        had been flowing in a slightly different direction. </p>
                    <p> ‘But what I want to ask,’ she said, ‘is this. I want to know why it is that
                        whenever one hears it said, “Oh, So-and-so is a very <hi>cultivated</hi>
                        person,” one always expects to find him—well, almost half professional as it
                        were, or at least able to talk of nothing but music, or painting, or books?
                        I mean, a man who’s <hi>merely</hi> a cultivated person doesn’t seem ever to
                        be quite a man of the world, or to be much good in society, except when one
                        wants him to talk on his own subjects—I hate people myself who <hi>have</hi>
                        subjects—and then, ten to one, he doesn’t know when to leave off. Now, Mr.
                        Laurence, I see you want to interrupt me; but do let me say my say. A right
                        amount of culture is of course delightful, and personally, I don’t much care
                        for people who haven’t got it. But too much of it—I’m sure, Mr. Laurence,
                        you must agree with me at heart—is a mistake. And that, you know, is all I
                        mean about it; nothing more than that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Laurence, smiling, ‘I think I see what it is. You <hi>will</hi>
                        look on culture as some special kind of accomplishment or taste like music;
                        and you think that in some special way it is bound up with books; and books
                        you look upon as something special also, beginning and ending with
                        themselves; and, unless I am much mistaken, you think that the more books a
                        man has read, the more cultivated you may safely call him.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Not all books,’ said Lady Ambrose in an injured tone. ‘Of course I don’t
                        mean trashy novels, and of course I don’t mean blue-books, or books of
                        history.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But what I want first of all to impress on you,’ said Laurence, ‘is that
                        whatever its relation to books may be, culture is by no means a bookish
                        thing, or a thing that ought to be less in place at Hurlingham than at the
                        South Kensington Museum. Nor is it in any sense a hobby, or a special taste,
                        to be gratified at the expense of anything else. Instead of that, it is the
                        education of all our tastes, of all our powers of enjoying life; and, so far
                        from its being a thing for recluses, and a substitute for society, it is
                        only when naturalised in the best society that it can at all do itself
                        justice in expressing itself outwardly, or even exist in any completeness
                        inwardly.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose smiled, and looked more interested, and began to give Laurence
                        her most intelligent attention. </p>
                    <p> ‘Still,’ Laurence went on, ‘culture and books have a good deal to do with
                        one another; and since they are so bound up together in your mind, let us
                        try to see at once what the relation really is. Let us begin, then, with
                        that part of culture which in this sense is most bound up with books—most
                        bound up because it cannot be got without them; the part of culture, I mean,
                        that comes from the knowledge of the past—from a knowledge of history, in
                        short, or parts of history.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose here took Laurence fairly aback by the way in which she
                        repeated the word ‘History!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, judging from the results I have seen,’ she said, with an amount of
                        decision in her voice that was positively startling, ‘I cannot say, Mr.
                        Laurence, that I agree with you. And I think that on this subject I have a
                        right to speak.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What on earth <hi>can</hi> the woman be meaning?’ said Mr. Luke to himself. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is not a fortnight ago,’ Lady Ambrose went on, ‘that I sat at dinner by
                        somebody—I won’t tell you his name—who had not only read heaven knows how
                        much history, but had written, I believe, even more than he had read. And
                        what do you think this good man did during all the early part of dinner?
                        Why, he did nothing but fume, and fret, and bluster, so that everyone was
                        made uncomfortable, simply because somebody said that King Harold was not
                        quite so excellent a character as the late Prince Consort; and I heard him
                        muttering, “What monstrous injustice! What monstrous ignorance!” to himself
                        for nearly half an hour. I don’t think I ever saw such a—I was going to
                        say,’ said Lady Ambrose, laughing softly, ‘such a beast —but I won’t; I’ll
                        say a bear instead. At last, however—I don’t know how it came about—he said
                        to me, in a very solemn voice, “What a terrible defeat that was which we had
                        at Bouvines!” I answered timidly—not thinking we were at war with
                        anyone—that I had seen nothing about it in the papers. “H’m!” he said,
                        giving a sort of a grunt that made me feel dreadfully ignorant, “why, I had
                        an Excursus on it myself in the ‘Archæological Gazette,’ only last week.”
                        And, do you know, it turned out that the Battle of Bouvines was fought in
                        the thirteenth century, and had, as far as I could make out, something to do
                        with Magna Charta. Now, Mr. Laurence, if that’s the sort of culture one gets
                        from studying history, I’m glad I’ve forgotten even the names of the twelve
                        Cæsars, and the date of the kings of England. Besides,’ Lady Ambrose added,
                        ‘it makes one think what a serious thing it is to lose a battle, if people
                        are to be made so cross about it six hundred years afterwards.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I quite agree with you,’ said Laurence, ‘that if that’s the sort of culture
                        one gets from history, we had better never open a history book again. But
                        history, Lady Ambrose, has very little to do with the Battle of Bouvines,
                        and nothing with the character of Harold.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Then what has it got to do with?’ asked Lady Ambrose incredulously. ‘It
                        certainly has to do with kings, and wars, and facts, and dates, hasn’t it?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What people call facts,’ said Laurence, ‘are only the dry bones of history.
                        It is quite true that most professed historians have hitherto, instead of
                        painting the face of the past, simply made discrepant notes about the shape
                        of its skull: everything that could give the shape of the skull the least
                        significance they left unthought of, or dismissed it in an occasional
                        chapter. But really the least important of all the world’s events are those
                        that you can localise exactly, and put an exact date to; those which alone
                        most historians see.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ interposed Miss Merton, ‘don’t you call such things as the events in
                        Caesar’s life, for instance, or Hildebrand’s, history?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Looked on simply as events,’ said Laurence, ‘I call them biography, or I
                        call them <hi>illustrations</hi> of history; but I do not call them history.
                        History, in its true sense, is a travelling in the past; the best of
                        histories would be but the carriage or the steamboat you travelled by; your
                        histories of dates and battles are at best but the Bradshaws and the
                        railway-maps. Our past must be an extension of the present, or it is no real
                        past. Now I expect, Lady Ambrose, that, in its true sense, you know a good
                        deal more history than you are aware of. I saw you reading Saint-Simon
                        yesterday evening, and you alluded to Grammont’s Memoirs at dinner.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh, of course,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘books like that! But, then, they really
                        give you such a notion of the times, and quite take you back to them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Nothing is history that does not,’ said Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘Really,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, brightening. ‘“II y a plus de vingt ans
                        que je dis de la prose, sans que j’en susse rien.” And so it seems that I
                        have known history without suspecting it, just as M. Jourdain talked prose.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Pardon me,’ cried Mr. Saunders, ‘if I interrupt you for a moment; but, Mr.
                        Laurence, though I admit that there is a great deal of truth in what you
                        say, you have not even alluded to the great function of history, nor have
                        you even hinted at the great use of facts. However, perhaps I had better
                        reserve what I have to say on this, as well as on certain other matters,
                        till by-and-by.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Very well,’ said Laurence, ‘if history, then, is a travelling in the
                        past—what else it is, as Mr. Saunders says, we can talk of afterwards—don’t
                        you see what it does for us, Lady Ambrose, in the way of culture—does for
                        us, not as students, but as men and women of the world? Just think for a
                        moment what our own age would seem to us if all the past, beyond the
                        memories of our grandfathers, was a blank to us; and then think how
                        infinitely our minds are enlarged, how a freer air, as it were, seems to
                        blow through them, even from that vague knowledge of the past afloat in the
                        world, which we pick up here and there as we go along. Even that has an
                        effect upon us. It prevents us being, as we else should be, merely
                            <hi>temporal</hi> people who are just as narrow-minded and dull as those
                        merely <hi>local</hi> people—the natives of a neighbourhood—who wear
                        gorgeous ribands at flower-shows in the country. Don’t you remember last
                        year, when I was staying with you, how you pointed some of them out to me,
                        and how amused you were at their ways and their finery?’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose smiled and nodded. </p>
                    <p> ‘Go on, Mr. Laurence—I can understand all this,’ she said. ‘But I want to
                        hear a little more.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘your own knowledge of the history of France and
                        England during the last two hundred years—you know well enough how that has
                        made you, in a certain sense, more a woman of the world. What would you be,
                        for instance, if you never knew that there had been a French Revolution, or
                        an English Revolution—a Cromwell, or a Louis Quatorze, or a Mirabeau? But
                        your knowledge of history does not end here. You know something, at any
                        rate, of the feudal times. You know what a castle was like, what a knight
                        was like, what a monk was like. You know something, too, Of Roman and Greek
                        history; and, come—to go no farther—you know the Bible.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I hope,’ said Lady Ambrose, in a voice of reproving solemnity, ‘that one
                        would not call that history.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Certainly not,’ said Mr. Saunders, with a small suppressed chuckle. </p>
                    <p> ‘At all events,’ proceeded Laurence, ignoring these interruptions, ‘you know
                        something of Rome, and Greece, and Palestine, and Egypt; and each of these
                        names is really a little aërial chariot which carries your imagination back
                        as you pronounce it into some remote age, when life was different from what
                        it is now. So is the mind widened by even a little vague history. Or, just
                        repeat to yourself such words as <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi>, and
                        think for a moment of the effect of them. They are not mere names—mere
                        geographical expressions; but they are spells which evoke, whether you will
                        or no, hosts of subtle associations, rising up like spirits out of the past
                        centuries, and hovering in the air round you with their unbidden influence,
                        and mixing with all your notions of Europe as it is now. Or, would you feel
                        the matter more strongly yet, think, when you are travelling, what but for
                        history would Venice be, or Athens, or Jerusalem? If it were not for
                        history, be it never so vaguely understood, would you find the same
                        indescribable fascination in Rome?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I never was at Rome,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘We’re going there next winter
                        with the Kenningtons.’ </p>
                    <p> This piece of intelligence brought Laurence to a stop. Mr. Rose, however,
                        whose imagination had been fired by all this talk about history, suddenly
                        broke forth. </p>
                    <p> ‘And also,’ he exclaimed, ‘is it not by history alone that we can in our day
                        learn anything of the more subtle and gorgeous dyes that life is capable of
                        taking—how fair a thing it may be, how rich in harmonious freedom, and
                        beauty of form, and love, and passionate friendship? Why, but for history,
                        what should we be now but a flock of listless barbarians, ὀνειράτων ἀλίγκιοι
                        μορφαισι φύρόντες εἰκη πάντα ? Would not all life’s choicer and subtler
                        pleasures be lost to us, if Athens did not still live to redeem us from the
                        bondage of the middle age, and if the Italian Renaissance—that strange child
                        of Aphrodite and Tannhaüser, did not still live to stimulate us out of the
                        torpor of the present age? What, but for history, should we know,’ cried Mr.
                        Rose, ‘of the χάρις of Greece, of the lust of Rome, of the strange secrets
                        of the Borgias? Consider, too, the bowers of quiet, full of sweet dreams,
                        that history will always keep for us—how it surrounds the house of the
                        present with the boundless gardens of the past—gardens rich in woods, and
                        waters, and flowers, and outlooks on illimitable seas. Think of the immortal
                        dramas which history sets before us; of the keener and profounder passions
                        which it shows in action, of the exquisite groups and figures it reveals to
                        us, of nobler mould than ours—Harmodius and Aristogeiton, Achilles and
                        Patroclus, David and Jonathan, our English Edward and the fair Piers
                        Gaveston, ἅμα τ’ ὠκύμορος καὶ ὀϊζυρὸς περὶ πάντων, or, above all, those two
                        by the agnus castus and the plane-tree where Ilyssus flowed,’—Mr. Rose’s
                        voice gradually subsided,—‘and where the Attic grasshoppers chirped in
                        shrill summer choir.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘At any rate, Lady Ambrose,’ Laurence resumed briskly, ‘you now see
                        something of the way in which history gives us culture; and you see,
                        too,—this is the chief point I want to impress upon you,—that in history,
                        and many other things as well, books are only the telescopes through which
                        we see distant facts; and we no more become <hi>bookish</hi> by such a use
                        of books than you became <hi>optical</hi> when you looked through your
                        telescope in Gloucestershire, and saw Captain Audley, at the bottom of the
                        park, proposing to your under-keeper’s daughter.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I really do believe,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘that that man is a little off his
                        head. However,’ she went on laughing, ‘I give up about the bookishness, Mr.
                        Laurence, and I dare say one really is the better for knowing something
                        about history; but still, I can’t help thinking that the chief thing to know
                        about is, after all, the life about one, and that knowledge, just like
                        charity, should begin at home.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘There,’ said Laurence, ‘we quite agree; and that, if I managed to express
                        myself clearly, was the very thing that I set out with saying. It
                            <hi>is</hi> with the life about us that all our concern lies; and
                        culture’s double end is simply this—to make us appreciate that life, and to
                        make that life worth appreciating. We only study the past to adorn our
                        present, or to make our view of it clearer. And now, since we have at any
                        rate suggested how this is done, let us put the past, and the distant
                        too—everything, in fact, to which books are only the telescopes—out of our
                        minds altogether, and merely consider the real heart of the matter—culture
                        and the present. I tried to explain just now that we meant by a man of
                        culture one on whom none of the finer flavours of life are lost—who can
                        appreciate, sympathise with, criticise, all the scenes, situations, sayings,
                        or actions around him—a sad or happy love-affair, a charm of manner and
                        conversation, a beautiful sunset, or a social absurdity. I declare,’ said
                        Laurence, ‘I could tell better whether a man was really cultivated, from the
                        way in which he talked gossip, or told a story; than from the way in which
                        he discussed a poem or a picture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Certainly,’ said Leslie. ‘I don’t call a woman cultivated who bothers me at
                        dinner first with discussing this book and then that—whose one perpetual
                        question is, “Have you read So-and-so?” But I call a woman cultivated who
                        responds and who knows what I mean as we pass naturally from subject to
                        subject—who by a flash or a softness in her eyes, by a slight gesture of the
                        hand, by a sigh, by a flush in the cheek, makes me feel as I talk of some
                        lovely scene that she too could love it—as I speak of love or sorrow, makes
                        me feel that she herself has known them; as I speak of ambition, or
                            <hi>ennui</hi> or hope, or remorse, or loss of character, makes me feel
                        that all these are not mere names to her, but things.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you call <hi>me</hi> cultivated, Mr. Leslie?’ whispered Mrs. Sinclair,
                        in a soft parenthesis. </p>
                    <p> ‘I mean,’ said Leslie, finishing, ‘I like to hear each key I touch make, not
                        a dead thud as on a piece of wood, but strike a musical string.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Good,’ murmured Mr. Rose; ‘that is good! Yes,’ he continued, ‘the aim of
                        culture, if Mr. Leslie will lend me his nice metaphor, is indeed to make the
                        soul a musical instrument, which may yield music either to itself or to
                        others, at any appulse from without; and the more elaborate a man’s culture
                        is, the richer and more composite can this music be. The minds of some men
                        are like a simple pastoral reed. Only single melodies, and these
                        unaccompanied, can be played upon them—glad or sad; whilst the minds of
                        others, who look at things from countless points of view, and realise, as
                        Shakespeare did, their composite nature—their minds become, as Shakespeare’s
                        was, like a great orchestra. Or sometimes,’ said Mr. Rose dreamily, as if
                        his talk was lapsing into a soliloquy—‘when he is a mere passive observer of
                        things, letting impressions from without move him as they will, I would
                        compare the man of culture to an Æolian harp, which the winds at will play
                        through—a beautiful face, a rainbow, a ruined temple, a death-bed, or a line
                        of poetry, wandering in like a breath of air amongst the chords of his soul,
                        touching note after note into soft music, and at last gently dying away into
                        silence.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, now,’ said Laurence, in a very matter-of-fact tone, for he saw that
                        Mr. Rose’s dreamy manner always tended to confuse Lady Ambrose, ‘since we
                        are now clear that the aim of culture is to make us better company as men
                        and women of the world, let us consider a little farther how culture is
                        attained. We have just spoken of histories and other books, which merely
                        bring us face to face with facts that would else be out of our reach. We now
                        come to two other things—the facts of the life about us, the facts which
                        experience teaches us, and to which all other facts are secondary; and,
                        farther, to the way in which all this knowledge—the knowledge of the living
                        present especially—is (for we have really not talked of this at all yet)
                        turned into culture. Mere acquaintance with facts will not do it; mere
                        experience of facts will not do it. A woman, for instance may have had all
                        kinds of experience—society, sorrow, love, travel, remorse, distraction—and
                        yet she may not be cultivated. She may have gone through everything only
                        half consciously. She may never have recognised what her life has been. What
                        is needed to teach her—to turn this raw material into culture? Here, Lady
                        Ambrose, we come to our friends the books again—not, however to such books
                        as histories, but to books of art, to poetry, and books akin to poetry. The
                        former do but enlarge our own common experience. The latter are an
                        experience in themselves, and an experience that interprets all former
                        experiences. The mind, if I may borrow an illustration from photography, is
                        a sensitised plate, always ready to receive the images made by experience on
                        it. Poetry is the developing solution, which first makes these images
                        visible. Or, to put it in another way, if some books are the telescopes with
                        which we look at distant facts, poetry—I use the word in its widest sense—is
                        a magic mirror which shows us the facts about us reflected in it as no
                        telescope or microscope could show them to us. Let a person of experience
                        look into this, and experience then becomes culture. For in that magic
                        mirror we see our life surrounded with issues viewless to the common eye. We
                        see it compassed about with chariots of fire and with horses of fire. Then
                        we know the real aspect of our joys and sorrows. We see the lineaments, we
                        look into the eyes of thoughts, and desires, and associations, which had
                        been before unseen and scarcely suspected presences—dim swarms clustering
                        around our every action. Then how all kinds of objects and of feelings begin
                        to cling together in our minds! A single sense or a single memory is
                        touched, and a thrill runs through countless others. The smell of autumn
                        woods, the colour of dying fern, may turn by a subtle transubstantiation
                        into pleasures and faces that will never come again—a red sunset and a windy
                        sea-shore into a last farewell, and the regret of a lifetime.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence had chosen these illustrations of his quite at random; but he was
                        fortunate in the last in a way which he never dreamt of. Lady Ambrose, in
                        her early and unwise days, had actually had a love-affair. She had been
                        engaged to a handsome young Guardsman, with only eleven hundred a year, and
                        no prospects but debts; and though she had successfully exchanged him for
                        Sir George and his million of money, she still sometimes recalled him, and
                        the wild September evening when she had seen her last of him upon Worthing
                        pier. </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ she exclaimed, with some emotion in her voice, ‘I know exactly what
                        you mean now. Why, there have been poems at one time or another of one’s
                        life, that one could really hardly bear to hear repeated. Now, there’s that
                        of Byron’s, “When we two parted.” I don’t even know if it is right to think
                        it a good poem—but still, do you know, there was a time when, just because
                        it was connected with something—it almost made me cry if anyone repeated or
                        sang it—one of my brothers, I know, who had a beautiful voice, was always—’
                        Lady Ambrose here grew conscious that she was showing more feeling than she
                        thought at all becoming. She blushed, she stammered a little, and then,
                        making a rush at another topic, ‘But what is Mr. Rose,’ she exclaimed,
                        ‘saying about the Clock-tower and the Thames Embankment?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I was merely thinking,’ said Mr. Rose, who had been murmuring to himself at
                        intervals for some time, ‘of a delicious walk I took last week, by the river
                        side, between Charing Cross and Westminster. The great clock struck the
                        chimes of midnight; a cool wind blew; and there went streaming on the wide
                        wild waters with long vistas of reflected lights wavering and quivering in
                        them; and I roamed about for hours, hoping I might see some unfortunate cast
                        herself from the Bridge of Sighs. It was a night I thought well in harmony
                        with despair. Fancy,’ exclaimed Mr. Rose, ‘the infinity of emotions which
                        the sad sudden splash in the dark river would awaken in one’s mind—and all
                        due to that one poem of Hood’s!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Laurence, not having listened to Mr. Rose, who spoke, indeed,
                        somewhat low, ‘Yes,’ he said, continuing the same train of thought he had
                        left off with, and looking first at Lady Ambrose and then at Miss Merton,
                        ‘is it not poetry that does all this for the world? I use poetry in its
                        widest sense, and include in it all imaginative literature, and other art as
                        well. Is it not the poet that gives our existence all its deepest colours,
                        or enables us to give them to it ourselves? Is it not—if I may quote a
                        translation of Goethe that I made myself— <quote>

                        </quote> And so,’ Laurence went on, ‘if it is to the bard that we owe all
                        these fine things, we need surely not fear that we shall be thought bookish
                        if we say that a society cannot be really good that does not as a body draw
                        a large amount of its nourishment from the bard’s work. Of course in one
                        sense poetry exists unwritten; but in the general run of people this will
                        never properly awake itself, make itself available, but at the spell of
                        written poetry. Nay, this is true even of the poet himself. Why else does he
                        externalise his feelings—give them a body? As I say, however, the general
                        catholic use of poetry is not to make us admire the poetry of poems but
                        discern the poetry of life. I myself,’ Laurence went on, ‘am devoted to
                        literature as literature, to poetry as poetry. I value it not only because
                        it makes me appreciate the originals of the things it deals with, but for
                        itself. I often like the description of a sunset better than I like a
                        sunset; I don’t care two straws about Liberty, but my mind is often set all
                        aglow by a good ode to her. I delight in, I can talk over, I can brood over,
                        the form of a stanza, the music of a line, the turn of a phrase, the flavour
                        of an epithet. Few things give me such pleasure for the moment as an apt
                        quotation from Horace or Shakespeare. But this, I admit, is a hobby—a
                        private hobby—this distinct literary taste, just as a taste for blue china
                        is, and must certainly not be confused with culture in its deeper and wider
                        sense.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Rose earnestly, ‘don’t despise this merely literary culture,
                        as you call it, or the pleasure it is to have at command a beautiful
                        quotation. As I have been lying on the bank here, this afternoon, and
                        looking up into the trees, and watching the blue sky, glancing between the
                        leaves of them—as I have been listening to the hum of the insects, or
                        looking out with half-shut eyes towards the sea across the green rustling
                        shrubs, and the red rose-blossoms, fragments of poetry have been murmuring
                        in my memory like a swarm of bees, and have been carrying my fancy hither
                        and thither in all manner of swift luxurious ways. The “spreading favour,”
                        for instance, of these trees that we sit under, brought just now into my
                        mind those magical words of Virgil’s— <quote><l>    O qui me gelidis in
                                vallibus Haemi</l></quote> What a picture there! What a thrill it
                        sent all through me, like a rush of enchanted wind! In another moment the
                        verse that goes just before, also came to me— <quote><l>       Virginibus
                                bacchata Lacaenis</l></quote> and into the delicious scene now
                        around me —this beautiful modern garden—mixed instantly visions of Greek
                        mountains, and ragged summits, and choirs of Laconian maidens maddened with
                        a divine enthusiasm, and with fair white vesture wildly floating. Again,
                        another line from the same poem, from the same passage, touched my memory,
                        and changed, in a moment, the whole complexion of my feelings— <quote> Felix
                            qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas. </quote> Think of that! The spirit
                        is whirled away in a moment of time, and set amongst quite new images, quite
                        other sources of excitement. But again, in an instant, the splash of the
                        fountain caught my ear, and awoke, I scarcely know how, the memory of some
                        lines in one of Petrarch’s Epistles— <quote><l>   Soporifero clausam qui
                                murmure vallem</l></quote> and my imagination, on the wings of the
                        verses, was borne away floating towards Vaucluse. Think, then, within the
                        space of five minutes how many thoughts and sensations, composite and
                        crowded, can, by the agency of mere literature, enrich the mind, and make
                        life intenser.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And I—’ said Laurence, smiling,—‘do you see that far-away sail out—on the
                        horizon line?—well, I caught myself murmuring over a scrap of Milton, only
                        two minutes ago— <quote><l> As when afar at sea a fleet descried</l><l>
                                Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial gales</l></quote> Why, I could
                        go on capping verses with you the whole afternoon, if we had nothing else to
                        do. But besides this, a knowledge of books as books has got another use. How
                        it enriches conversation, by enabling us to talk by hints and allusions, and
                        to convey so many more meanings than our actual words express. I came across
                        an exquisite instance of this the other day, in a book of anecdotes about
                        the poet Rogers, which shows how a familiarity with the scenes even of Greek
                        poetry may give a brilliance to fashionable talk in the nineteenth century.
                        One evening at Miss Lydia White’s—she was a Tory, and well known then in
                        society—a guest who was a Whig, said <hi>à propos</hi> of the depressed
                        state of his own party at the time, “There is nothing left for us but to
                        sacrifice a Tory virgin.” “Yes,” said Miss Lydia White, “I believe there’s
                        nothing the Whigs wouldn’t do <hi>to raise the wind</hi>.” But yet, after
                        all, this is not <hi>the</hi> important thing, and I hope Lady Ambrose will
                        forgive us for having talked so long about it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And so one <hi>must</hi> read a great deal, after all, to be really
                        cultivated,’ said Lady Ambrose, in a disappointed tone. ‘You’ve made culture
                        seem so nice, that I feel positively quite ashamed to think how seldom now I
                        look at a line of poetry, except, of course, when anything new comes out,
                        that everybody <hi>must</hi> read.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t think you need be afraid on that score,’ said Leslie. ‘If society
                        is to be cultivated, it must, no doubt, read a good deal, as a body. But all
                        its members need not. With women especially, nothing startles me more than
                        when I find sometimes how very far, if they have had any serious experience
                        of the world and life, a very little poetry will go.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I expect,’ said Miss Merton, ‘that we are naturally more introspective than
                        men, and so, in what concerns ourselves, a very little will make us
                        cultivated; although we don’t certainly get so easily as men that
                        indifferent way of looking on life as a whole, which I suppose is what you
                        call the dramatic spirit, and which people praise so in Shakespeare. But as
                        to what Mr. Leslie says, I have so often myself noticed the same thing in
                        girls—especially at times when they are passing into womanhood, without
                        having made much of a success of youth. I remember one poor friend of mine,
                        whose whole life seemed to become clear to her through just one line of
                        Tennyson’s— <quote> My life has crept so long on a broken wing. </quote> I
                        suppose it was a sort of magic mirror to her as Mr. Laurence was saying just
                        now.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I,’ said Leslie, ‘once knew some one at Baden, who spent half her time at
                        the tables, as much the observed of all observers as Worth and her own
                        strange beauty could make her—she liked being stared at—and who was
                        certainly not a woman who gave much of her time to reading. She was very
                        wretched with her husband, and her name was far from being above the reach
                        of gossip. Talking one day to her in a hardish flippant sort of way—a tone
                        of talk which she affected to like—I alluded by some chance to Francesca di
                        Rimini in Dante; and I shall never forget the tone in which she exclaimed,
                        “Poor Francesca!”—its passion and its pathos. I was surprised that she had
                        even looked into Dante: but she had; and that one passage had lit up her
                        whole life for her—that one picture of the two lovers “going for ever on the
                        accursed air.”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘How nice of you, Mr. Leslie,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, ‘to remember my poor
                        verses!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Let us consider, too,’ said Laurence, ‘that poetry does not only enable us
                        to appreciate what we have already experienced, but it puts us in the way of
                        getting new experiences. This was Wordsworth’s special claim for poetry,
                        that it widened our sympathies—widened them in some new direction—that it
                        was ever giving us, in fact, not new quotations, but new culture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, here,’ said Leslie, ‘is a thing that continually occurs to me. Just
                        consider for moment the wonderful social effect of even so partial a thing
                        as the culture that Wordsworth himself gave us. Consider the effect of it on
                        a common worldly woman—let her be girl or matron—who without it would be
                        nothing but a half mechanical creature, living, as far as her interests
                        went, a wretched hand-to-mouth existence of thin distraction, or eager
                        anxious scheming for herself or her daughters. Cultivate her, I say, just in
                        this one direction—give her but this one fragment of culture, a love of
                        Nature—and all the mean landscape of her mind will be lit up with a sudden
                        beauty, as the beam of ideal sunshine breaks across it, with its “light that
                        never was on sea or land.” I don’t say that such a woman will become better
                        for this, but she will become more interesting. In a girl, however pretty,
                        what is there to interest a man if he reads nothing in her face from night
                        to night but that she is getting daily more worn and jaded in the search for
                        a rich husband? Or even, to go a step higher, in the unthinking,
                        uncultivated flirt, so common in every class of society—what is there in her
                        that a man will not soon discover to be insipid and wearying? ’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Surely,’ remonstrated Mrs. Sinclair plaintively, ‘that rather depends on
                        what she is like. I must stand up for my sex.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But give her,’ Leslie went on, ‘one genuine, one disinterested taste, and
                        all is changed. If I had an audience about me of young ladies, whom it was
                        not too late to advise—girls entering on the world, determined to run the
                        worldly course, and to satisfy all the expectations of the most excellent
                        and lowest-minded of chaperons, I would say this to them:—I have no doubt
                        you are all ignorant; of course you are all vain. That to make a brilliant
                        match is your great object, you all avow. A certain sort of flirting, of
                        which the less said the better, is your most disinterested taste. I know all
                        this (I should say), and I can’t help it; nor do I ask you to alter one of
                        these points for the better. But this I do ask you to do. Try to add
                        something else to them. Try to win for yourselves one taste of a truer and
                        deeper sort. Study Wordsworth, and some parts of Shelley; open out your
                        sympathies, by their aid, in just one direction. Learn to love the sea, and
                        the woods, and the wild flowers, with all their infinite changes of scent,
                        and colour, and sound—the purple moor, the brown mountain stream, the
                        rolling mists, the wild smell of the heather. Let these things grow to
                        “haunt you like a passion,” learn in this way the art of <quote><l>
                                           desiring</l></quote> You’ll perhaps find it a little dull
                        at first; but go on, and don’t be disheartened; and
                        then—by-and-by—by-and-by, go and look in the looking-glass, and study your
                        own face. Hasn’t some new look, child, come into your eyes, and given them
                        an expression—a something that they wanted before? Smile. Hasn’t your smile
                        some strange meaning in it that it never used to have? You are a little more
                        melancholy, perhaps. But no matter. The melancholy is worth its cost. You
                        are now a mystery. Men can’t see through you at a glance as they did; and
                        so, as Sterne says, “you have their curiosity on your side,” and that
                        alone—even that will have increased your value tenfold in our Babylonian
                        marriage-market.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, Mr. Leslie,’ said Lady Ambrose with severe gravity, ‘if that’s the
                        way you’d talk to young ladies, I should be very careful you never spoke to
                        any that I had anything to do with.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Many people, I know,’ Leslie went on, passing by the rebuke, ‘think that
                        books and culture are a kind of substitute for life, and that the real
                        masters in the art of living have no need for this poor <hi>pis-aller</hi>.
                        They only drive four-in-hand, or shoot, or dance, or run away with their
                        friends’ wives. But no mistake can be greater. Culture is not a substitute
                        for life, but the key to it. It is really to the men of culture, to the men
                        who have read and who have thought, that all exercise, all distractions,
                        mental or bodily, moral or immoral, yield their finer keener pleasures. They
                        are the men that husbands dread for their wives, and that fascinating people
                        find fascinating.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose much disapproved of the tone of this speech; but none the less,
                        in a certain mysterious way, did it insidiously increase her appreciation of
                        the value of culture; and she felt that with Laurence at any rate she most
                        thoroughly agreed, when he said by way of summing up, </p>
                    <p> ‘And so now I think we see what culture is, and the reason why it is
                        essential to good society. We see that much as it depends on books, life is
                        really the great thing it has to do with. It is the passions, the interests,
                        the relations, the absurdities of life that it fits us to see into, to
                        taste, to discriminate. And I think we see, too, that not only is culture
                        essential to good society, but good society also is essential to culture,
                        and that there was therefore very good reason for the exclusiveness we began
                        with. For in the first place I expect it requires certain natural advantages
                        of position to look at and overlook life in that sympathetic and yet
                        self-possessed way, which alone can give us a complete view of it. And in
                        the next place, the more we discern in life, the more social polish shall we
                        want to do justice to our discernment; and not polish only, but those far
                        subtler things, tone and balance as well. I think it was the late Lord
                        Lytton who remarked in one of his books, what an offensive thing gaiety was
                        sure to be in any woman except one of the most perfect breeding. So too with
                        humour—the greater sense of humour a well-bred man has, the more delightful
                        he is; the greater sense of humour a vulgar man has, the more intolerable he
                        is.’ </p>
                    <p> The measure of Lady Ambrose’s assent was now almost complete. It remained,
                        however, for Mrs. Sinclair to give the finishing touch. </p>
                    <p> ‘I remember,’ she said softly and regretfully, ‘a friend of mine—he was
                        killed afterwards, poor man, in a duel near Dresden—who once, when he was
                        down for some weeks in the country fishing, fell desperately in love with a
                        certain rector’s daughter, who sang, and painted, and read German, and had a
                        beautiful figure as well. The mother at once saw what was in the wind, and
                        asked him directly to come and lunch at the rectory. And there three things
                        happened. First, the mother began telling him what very superior society
                        there was in the neighbouring local town; “In fact, its tone,” she said, “is
                            <hi>almost</hi> like that of a cathedral town.” Then the lovely daughter
                        asked him if he was <hi>partial</hi> to boiled chicken; and then, a little
                        later on—it was this that quite finished him, for the two first shocks he
                        said he might have got over—in answer to some little common joke or other
                        that he made, she told him, with a sort of arch smile—what do you think?
                        why, that he was <hi>saucy</hi>.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I confess,’ said Miss Merton, laughing, ‘that it <hi>would</hi> take a very
                        great deal of charm of some sort to make one get over that. At any rate,
                        it’s a comfort to think that the young ladies in our new Republic won’t call
                        their admirers “saucy.”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘and so we have got thus far—we have made our ideal
                        society as highly bred, as highly educated, as polished, as sparkling, as
                        graceful, as easy, as dignified, as we can possibly imagine it. And now,
                        what next?’ </p>
                    <p> There was a moment’s pause. </p>
                    <p> ‘What I should want in a Utopia,’ Allen broke in abruptly, ‘would be
                        something definite for the people to do, each in his own walk of life. What
                        I should want would be some honest, definite, straightforward, religious
                        belief that we might all live by, and that would connect what we did and
                        went through here with something more important elsewhere. Without this, to
                        start with,’ he said, half sadly and half coldly, ‘all life seems to me a
                        mockery.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And are you quite sure,’ said Laurence, with a slight sigh, ‘that it is not
                        a mockery?’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke here saw an opening for which he had long been waiting. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
                    <p> ‘MY dear Laurence,’ Mr. Luke began, ‘of course human life is a mockery, if
                        you leave out the one thing in it that is of real importance. And it is
                        because you have done this, that Lord Allen thinks that culture is so little
                        worth caring for, though I doubt, by the way, if he expressed quite
                        accurately what I conclude him to have meant. However,’ said Mr. Luke,
                        clearing his throat, and looking round at the general company, ‘what was
                        said about culture just now was perfectly right—perfectly right, and really
                        capitally illustrated—as far as it went. The only fault was that, as I say,
                        the most important point in the matter was entirely left out. It is quite
                        true that culture is, as Mr. Laurence observed so happily, the sensitising
                        of the mental palate—the making it a good taster. But a taster of what? Not
                        only of social absurdities, or love affairs, or beautiful scenery, but of
                        morality, of righteousness, of Christianity. The really profound work of
                        culture is to make us judges of these—judges able to tell in an instant real
                        righteousness and real Christianity from pseudo-righteousness and
                        pseudo-Christianity, so that we may swallow the true like the healing water
                        of life, and reject the false like a sample of bad claret—that we may have,
                        in fact, just the same horror of any doctrine or dogma that is contrary to
                        sweet reason (such, for instance,’ he said confidentially to Lady Grace, ‘as
                        that of eternal punishment) that we have for young ladies who call their
                        friends “saucy,” or for young ladies’ mothers who look on a bishop’s palace
                        as a focus of the most polite society. So I think, if you only all recognise
                        this, that culture includes—in fact, essentially is—the discernment of true
                        righteousness, of true morality, you need none of you fear that to a really
                        cultivated society life will be in any danger of becoming a mockery.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I was sorry,’ said Miss Merton in a low tone to Laurence, ‘to hear you say
                        that just now, because I know you don’t mean it.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence, who had been sitting a little above her on the bank, moved quietly
                        down, and placed himself at her side. </p>
                    <p> ‘You make me feel ashamed of myself,’ he said to her, ‘when you speak like
                        this.’ </p>
                    <p> There was something in his manner which a little embarrassed Miss Merton.
                        She looked down, and said nothing for a moment; and then, not having quite
                        command of her voice, she answered him in a tone rather louder than she
                        intended. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ she said, ‘and don’t you think that some definite faith or other is
                        needed by the world?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes, <hi>I</hi> think so; <hi>I</hi> think so. I entirely agree with Miss
                        Merton,’ exclaimed somebody. But it was not Laurence. To the surprise of
                        everyone, it was Mr. Saunders. All eyes were turned on him. </p>
                    <p> ‘Will you allow me,’ he said, looking round him with a nervous eagerness, as
                        though doubtful if he should gain a hearing, ‘will you allow me to make a
                        few observations here—it will only take a moment—to remind you of just a
                            <hi>few</hi> things which I think ought not to be lost sight of? Well,’
                        Mr. Saunders went on, as he seemed to have secured the ear of the house, ‘in
                        the first place as to history, just one word. The main use of history, which
                        Mr. Laurence forgot altogether to mention, is of course, as Comte has so
                        well established, to teach us his philosophy of it—to show us, in other
                        words, how entirely <hi>non compos mentis</hi> the world was till our time,
                        and that it is only in the present century that it has acquired the power of
                        passing a reasonable judgment. And next, as to facts; mere facts, as facts,
                        I think quite as useless as Mr. Laurence does, except for one reason. And
                        that reason is the way in which from every side they confute, give the lie
                        to, annihilate, the pretensions of revealed religion, and of the myths which
                        it calls its history. This, however, by the way. It was not the chief thing
                        that I wanted to say to you. Now, you all,’ Mr. Saunders went on, holding up
                        his forefinger and addressing the company, ‘propose to form a picture of
                        what the world ought to be—what I suppose you hope it will be; and you say,
                        and very rightly, that the great secret is that it should appreciate
                        properly the pleasures of human life. But, please mark this, you have quite
                        ignored the most important thing of all—the vast change that all these
                        pleasures are undergoing, that the whole aspect of life is undergoing,
                        beneath the touch of modern thought and modern philosophy; nay—and this
                        indeed is <hi>the</hi> special point I want to lay stress upon—Mr. Luke just
                        now even used those obsolete and misleading words, righteousness and
                        morality, soiled by so many unworthy associations. By the way,’ he
                        exclaimed, stopping suddenly and looking round him, ‘I suppose I may speak
                        the truth freely, as I know well enough that all to whom my vaticinations
                        would be unwelcome are sure to mistake me for a Cassandra.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Mistake him for a what?’ said Lady Ambrose, in a loud undertone. </p>
                    <p> ‘She was a beautiful young unfortunate,’ whispered Mrs. Sinclair
                        confidentially, ‘who was betrayed by the god Apollo.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Saunders was conscious he had raised a smile. He considered it a full
                        licence to proceed. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ he said, ‘as Miss Merton remarked a moment ago, some definite faith
                        is needed by the world; and, as I now deliberately declare, some definite
                        faith it will have—some one definite faith that will tolerate no dissent
                        from it; and it will have this before fifty years are over.’ </p>
                    <p> Everyone stared at Mr. Saunders, everyone except Mr. Luke, who simply smiled
                        at the sky, and said, with an air of suppressed pleasantry, ‘I had imagined
                        that our young friend’s motto was <hi>freedom</hi>.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Saunders was nettled at this beyond description. With a vindictive
                        quickness he fixed his eyes upon Mr. Luke. </p>
                    <p> ‘Sight is free,’ he said, uttering his words very slowly, as if each one
                        were a dagger in itself, and could give Mr. Luke a separate smart; ‘sight is
                        free,’ he said, ‘and yet the sight of all healthy men, I conceive, is in
                        agreement. It differs, I admit, when our eyes are dim with tears of
                        hysterical feeling; or when we are drunk; or when we are fighting—in this
                        last case, Mr. Luke, I am told we are often visited with illuminations of a
                        truly celestial radiance—but it is surely not such exceptional vision as
                        this that you praise as free. And it is just the same,’ said Mr. Saunders
                        triumphantly, ‘with the mind. The minds of men will never have been so free
                        as on that not-distant day when they shall all agree. And what will that
                        agreement result in? Why, in the utter banishment, the utter destruction—I
                        know no word strong enough to express my meaning—of all mystery and of all
                        mysticism, and consequently of that supposed inscrutable difference between
                        right and wrong, which has been made, in the hands of the priests, one of
                        the most hideous engines of terror that were ever employed to degrade and
                        crush mankind. Right and wrong, indeed! Righteousness and morality! There is
                        something insidious in their very sound. No —“useful,” “healthful,”
                        “serviceable,” “pleasant”—these will be the words of the future. Emancipated
                        man will know no wrong, save unhealthiness and unpleasantness. That most
                        treacherous handmaid of priestcraft, poetry, which, professing to heighten
                        the lights of life, did, in reality, only deepen its shadows, will delude
                        him no longer—she will be gone—gone for ever. Science, the liberator of
                        humanity, will have cast its light upon her; and the lying vision will
                        vanish. But why do I talk of poetry? Is not that, and every other
                        evil—reverence, faith, mysticism, humility, and all the unclean
                        company—comprised in this one word, Religion? Well, let religion—the
                            <hi>ancien régime</hi> of the world—retire, as it has done, to its
                        Versailles, and fence itself round for a little with its mercenary soldiers!
                        The Paris of the world is, at any rate, left free—and there the Revolution
                        of Humanity is begun. Science leads it, and in another fifty years there
                        will not be another religion left. Surely most here must know this,’
                        continued Mr. Saunders, ‘although they may perhaps forget it sometimes. But
                        the fact is notorious, and I really think—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Sir!’ </p>
                    <p> Where did that sudden, solemn exclamation come from—that single syllable at
                        which the music of Mr. Saunders’s voice, ‘like a fountain’s sickening
                        pulse,’ retired in a moment. Who had spoken? The sound surprised everybody.
                        It was Mr. Stockton—Mr. Stockton, with a face all aglow with feeling,
                        beneath his picturesque wide-awake hat, and holding in his hand a white
                        pocket-handkerchief bordered with pale blue. </p>
                    <p> ‘Perhaps,’ he continued, looking slowly round him, ‘I, as a man of science,
                        who have been a patient apprentice at my work for six-and-twenty years, may
                        be allowed to give some opinion on this matter. Destroy religion! Destroy
                        poetry!’ he exclaimed, in his rich, bell-like voice, that was now resonant
                        with an indignant melancholy. ‘Will science destroy either of these precious
                        and exquisite heritages of the human race? Will it extinguish one profound,
                        one ennobling, one devout feeling? Will it blight that rich culture on which
                        the present age so justly prides itself? I have followed science for
                        six-and-twenty years, I speak therefore from experience; and I boldly answer
                        “No.” How indeed should it? I know, I deplore, and I trust also forgive, the
                        common notion that it does. But how can that notion have arisen? That is
                        what puzzles me. Is not science essentially religious, essentially
                        poetical—nay, does it not deepen quite boundlessly the religion and poetry
                        already existing in the world, and fuse the two together, as they were never
                        fused before? Does it narrow our notions of life’s wonder and dignity to
                        peer into the abyss of being, and learn something of the marvellous laws of
                        things—to discover the same mysterious Something in a snow-flake, in the
                        scent of a rose, in the “topmost star of unascended heaven,” and in some
                        prayer or aspiration in the soul of man? True it is that this wondrous All
                        is Matter, and that all matter is atoms in its last analysis. No idle
                        metaphysics have clouded my brain, so I have been able to see these things
                        clearly—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes, yes, yes,’ cried Mr. Saunders, recovering himself, his voice tremulous
                        with excitement, ‘I know all that. I know that in their last analysis a pig
                        and a martyr, a prayer and a beef-steak, are just the same—atoms and atomic
                        movement. We, the younger generation of thinkers, accept all the premisses
                        you give us without a moment’s question. We only reason boldly and honestly
                        on them, and I defy you to prove—Mr. Stockton, sir, if you will only listen
                        to me—’ </p>
                    <p> But there was little chance of that. Interrupted only for a moment, and
                        whilst Mr. Saunders was yet speaking, Mr. Stockton’s eloquence swept on. </p>
                    <p> ‘Consider ourselves,’ he said, ‘consider the race of men, and note the truly
                        celestial light that science throws on that. We have ascended,’ said Mr.
                        Stockton; ‘noble thought! We have not descended. We are rising towards
                        heaven, we have not fallen from it. Yes—we, with attributes so like an
                        angel’s, with understanding so like a God’s—to this height we have already
                        risen. Who knows what future may not be in store for us? And then, on the
                        other hand, when the awestruck eye gazes, guided by science, through the
                        “dark backward and abysm of time,” and sees that all that is has unfolded
                        itself, unmoved and unbidden, (astounding thought!) from a brainless,
                        senseless, lifeless gas—the cosmic vapour, as we call it—and that it may,
                        for aught we know, one day return to it—I say, when we realise, when we
                        truly make our own, this stupendous truth, must not our feelings,’ said Mr.
                        Stockton, letting his eyes rest on Miss Merton’s with an appealing
                        melancholy—‘our feelings at such moments be religious? Are they not
                        Religion?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ said Miss Merton, ‘there is nothing religious <hi>in</hi> a gas. I
                        don’t see how anything religious can come out of it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Perfectly right!’ chuckled Mr. Saunders, faintly clapping his hands.
                        ‘Nothing can come out of the sack but what’s in it. Miss Merton’s perfectly
                        right.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, Miss Merton,’ Mr. Stockton continued, ‘don’t be frightened by the mere
                        sound of the word <hi>matter</hi>. For who knows what matter is’—(‘Then, why
                        talk about it?’ shrilled Mr. Saunders, unheeded)—‘that great Alpha and Omega
                        of the Universe?’ Mr. Stockton went on. ‘And don’t wrong me by thinking that
                        I “palter with you in a double sense,” and that I am not using the word
                            <hi>religion</hi> in its truest, its profoundest signification. Do you
                        think, Miss Merton, for instance, that I cannot feel with you, when, stirred
                        to your inmost soul by some strain of Mozart or Beethoven, you kneel before
                        your sacrificial altar, whilst the acolyte exalts the Host, and murmur with
                        bowed head your litany to your beautiful Virgin? I say advisedly, Miss
                        Merton, that I, as a man of science, can appreciate, and to a great extent
                        share, your adoring—your adorable frame of mind.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Stockton paused. His acquaintance with Catholic ritual, and the fact of
                        thus finding herself elected, without any merit of her own, as the special
                        object of so great a man’s eloquence, produced in Miss Merton an unfortunate
                        sense of absurdity, and in another moment she was conscious of nothing but a
                        most inappropriate desire to laugh. She compromised with her facial muscles,
                        however, and only gave a smile, which she trusted would pass muster as one
                        of grave enquiry. Mr. Stockton thought that it was so, and went on; but,
                        unknown to himself, he felt all the while that it was not so, and his
                        enthusiasm, he could not tell why, became somewhat more polemical. </p>
                    <p> ‘Does science, then,’ he proceeded, ‘rob us of one iota of religious
                        feeling, or degrade our notions of life’s measureless solemnity? Nay, it is
                        rather the flippant conceptions of theology that would do that, by
                        connecting everything with an eternal Personality—a personality so degraded
                        as to have some connection with ourselves. The prayer of the theologian,
                        “cabined, cribbed, confined” in spoken words, is directed to a Being that
                        Science can make no room for, and would not want, if she could. The prayer
                        of the man of science, for the most part of the silent sort, is directed
                        whither? demands what? He is silent if you ask him, for his answer would be
                        beyond the reach of words. Even to hint at its nature he would feel were a
                        profanity.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you know, Mr. Stockton,’ said Miss Merton, this time with a polite
                        meekness, ‘all this rather bewilders me.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And so it does me,’ said Mr. Stockton much pleased with Miss Merton’s
                        manner; ‘and this august bewilderment, which gives fulness and tone to our
                        existence, but which we can neither analyse nor comprehend—to me comes in
                        one shape, to you in another, and is—religion. In the name, then, of all
                        genuine science, and of all serious scientific men, let man keep, I say,’
                        said Mr. Stockton, looking round him, ‘this precious and ennobling
                        heritage—let him keep it and shape it ever anew, to meet his ever-changing
                        and deepening needs. In <hi>my</hi> dream of the future I see religions not
                        diminished, but multiplied, growing more and more richly diverse, as they
                        sink deeper into individual souls. Surely, science, then, is not come to
                        destroy the past, but to fulfil it—and I confess I can myself see no better
                        way of discovering what we desire in the future than by the charming
                        analysis Mr. Laurence has been giving us of what we most admire in the
                        present.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘See,’ said Donald Gordon softly, ‘here is science on the one side offering
                        us all religions, and on the other none.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Heigho!’ sighed Mr. Luke, very loud; ‘Let us agree about <hi>conduct</hi>
                        first, and quarrel about theology afterwards.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Precisely,’ resumed Mr. Stockton, to Mr. Luke’s extreme annoyance—Mr. Luke
                        himself having still much to say, and considering that Mr. Stockton did but
                        darken counsel by interrupting him—‘Mr. Luke is perfectly right.’ (‘I should
                        like to know how you know that,’ thought Mr. Luke.) ‘Let us agree about
                        conduct—morality, by-the-by, is the plainer word—that is the great thing.
                        Let us agree about the noble and the beautiful. Let us agree heroically to
                        follow truth—ay, truth; let us follow that, I say, picking our way step by
                        step, and not look where we are going. Let us follow—what can I add to
                        this?—the incomparable life of the great Founder of Christianity. Yes, Miss
                        Merton, entertaining the views that I do, I say the incomparable life. Such
                        is the message of science to the world; such is the instinct of culture when
                        enriched and quickened by science.’ </p>
                    <p> This was literally taking the bread out of Mr. Luke’s mouth. Not only was it
                        repeating what he had said before, but it was anticipating, in a formless
                        undisciplined way, the very thing that he was going to say again And the man
                        who had robbed him thus was a mere Philistine—a mere man of science who was
                        without even a smattering of Greek or Hebrew, and who thought sensori-motor
                        nerves and spontaneous generation more important subjects than Marcion’s
                        Gospel or the Psalms of David. For once in his life Mr. Luke was for the
                        moment completely silenced. Laurence however somewhat soothed him, by
                        replying to him, not to Mr. Stockton, </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes, I believe I was wrong after all; and that true culture will really
                        prevent us from looking on life as a mere mockery.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke was going to have answered; but, worse even than Mr. Stockton’s,
                        Mr. Saunders’s hated accents now got the start of him. </p>
                    <p> ‘One word more,’ Mr. Saunders exclaimed, ‘one plain word if you will allow
                        me. All this talk about Religion, Poetry, Morality, implies this—or it
                        implies nothing—the recognition of some elements of inscrutable mystery in
                        our lives and conduct; and to every mystery, to all mystery, science is the
                        sworn, the deadly foe. What she is daily more and more branding into man’s
                        consciousness is, that nothing is inscrutable that can practically concern
                        man. Use, pleasure, self-preservation—on these everything depends; on these
                        rocks of ages are all rules of conduct founded: and now that we have dug
                        down to these foundations, what an entirely changed fabric of life shall we
                        build upon them. Right and wrong, I again say, are entirely misleading
                        terms; and the superstition that sees an unfathomable gulf yawning between
                        them is the great bar to all healthful progress.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And I say, on the contrary,’ said Laurence, replying very suavely to Mr.
                        Saunders’s vehemence, ‘that it is on the recognition of this mysterious and
                        unfathomable gulf that the whole of the higher pleasures of life depend—and
                        the higher vicious pleasures as much as, if not more than, the virtuous.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose started at this. </p>
                    <p> ‘<hi>I</hi> am not vicious,’ said Mr. Saunders snappishly. ‘When I call
                        pleasure the one criterion of action, I am thinking of very different
                        pleasures from what you think I mean.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What is Mr. Saunders’s notion of the most passionate pleasure?’ said Mrs.
                        Sinclair bewitchingly. </p>
                    <p> ‘I agree with my great forerunner Hobbes’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘that the
                        strongest of all pleasures are those arising from the gratification of
                        curiosity; and he is the real ethical philosopher who subordinates all other
                        appetites to this, like Bacon, who lost his life through pursuing a
                        scientific experiment, or’ —he said pausing to think of another example— </p>
                    <p> ‘Like Bluebeard’s wives?’ enquired Mrs. Sinclair naïvely. ‘I’m afraid I
                        never give my husband his highest pleasure; for I never let him,’ she added
                        in a regretful whisper, ‘open my letters, although I read all his. But, Mr.
                        Saunders,’ she said, ‘if you are so fond of curiosity, you must have some
                        mystery to excite it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘but mystery is a fox for us to hunt and shoot;
                        not a God to hunt and shoot us.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Fancy,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose in horror, ‘shooting a fox! what sacrilege!’ </p>
                    <p> This remark, so entirely spontaneous, and so entirely unexpected, produced a
                        general laugh, in which all joined but Mr. Saunders himself, and Mr.
                        Herbert. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence at length, when the chorus had subsided, ‘may I read a
                        certain letter of my uncle’s to myself, which is printed in this very book I
                        have here? It was running in my mind just now, and is about the very matter
                        we were speaking of— the connection of religions, of Christian morality,
                        with all the higher pleasures of life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Very good,’ said Mr. Saunders. ‘Read what you please. I can only say that I
                        have at this moment in my portmanteau an analysis I have made of all the
                        Christian moral sentiments, in which I trace every one of them to such
                        disgusting or paltry origins as shall at once rob them of all their
                        pestilent <hi>prestige</hi>. I begin with the main root, the great first
                        parent of all these evils, the conception of God, which I show may have
                        arisen in seventy-three different ways, each one more commonplace than the
                        other. By-and-by, if you will not fear to confront the document, I will show
                        it to you.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke meanwhile had seen his way to bringing Mr. Stockton’s true
                        ignorance home to him, and had been regretting to him, in tones of insidious
                        confidence, that hardly enough stress had been laid just now on the
                        necessity of really wide reading—‘an intimacy,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘with the
                        great literatures of the world—a knowledge and comparison of the best things
                        that have been said and thought, in all the various ages, on the great
                        questions of life, without which,’ he added, ‘as you and I know, that
                        discrimination between right and wrong that we were speaking of just now,
                        can never be anything more than a make-believe.’ Nor did Mr. Luke seem at
                        all aware, as he was thus proceeding, that Laurence had found his place, and
                        had already begun to read, as follows: </p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘As I grow old, my dear Otho, I am coming to think over many things that
                            I have hitherto thought too little about, and, amongst others, the great
                            mystery of Christianity.’</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> At this point, however, Laurence and Mr. Luke were both interrupted by an
                        entirely unforeseen event. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
                    <p> LAURENCE had just got to the end of the first sentence, and Mr. Luke at the
                        same time was just reminding Mr. Stockton with some unction how impossible
                        it was for us to value properly that curious mixture of trumpery and
                        elevation, the ‘Apocalypse’ of John, unless we compared it with a very
                        kindred work, the ‘Pastor’ of Hermas, when a servant startled Laurence by
                        announcing in his ear the arrival of the vicar of the parish. </p>
                    <p> Everyone in dismay looked; and there, standing a pace away in the
                        background, the stranger was. He was an old man, very tall and spare, with
                        an ascetic aspect, but with a carriage dignified though slightly stooping,
                        and with severe, piercing eyes. The sudden embarrassment, however, which his
                        apparition seemed to cause the party was relieved somewhat by Laurence’s
                        taking him aside as if for some private conversation, and also by another
                        arrival of a far more genial nature—that of servants with tea, piles of
                        strawberries, iced coffee, and champagne cup. Mr. Rose at once bought
                        himself golden opinions of Lady Grace by helping her page, a pretty boy with
                        light curling hair, to arrange some tumblers on the grass. Mr. Stockton felt
                        his spirits suddenly rise, and began asking Lady Violet what she thought of
                        their new Republic as far as they had got with it. </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t know,’ she answered petulantly. ‘As far as I can see, you want
                        everyone to read a great many books and to have only one opinion. For my
                        part, I hate people who do the one, and a society that does the other.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What a charming girl Lady Violet is!’ said Mr. Stockton to Lady Grace, as
                        he stood by the tea table. ‘<hi>Such</hi> penetration! <hi>such</hi>
                        vivacity! <hi>such</hi> originality!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What beautiful sermons he does preach, to be sure!’ murmured Lady Ambrose. </p>
                    <p> ‘Who? Who?’ enquired several voices. </p>
                    <p> ‘Why, Dr. Seydon,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘Don’t you know him? Have you never
                        heard him in London—the gentleman with Mr. Laurence? See, he is coming back
                        again to have some tea.’ </p>
                    <p> It was indeed but too true. Mr. Luke’s face in especial grew very blank. Mr.
                        Saunders clenched his fist—a small one. </p>
                    <p> Dr. Seydon’s face, on the contrary, wore what for it was a really gracious
                        smile. He was mindful of how upon his arrival he had overheard the words
                        ‘Apocalypse’ and ‘mystery of Christianity.’ </p>
                    <p> As Laurence introduced him into the circle Lady Ambrose at once claimed
                        acquaintance with him, and made room for him at her side. </p>
                    <p> ‘I am sorry,’ he said, looking round him with a singularly dignified, almost
                        condescending courteousness, ‘to disturb in this way your Sunday’s reading.
                        But I can but stay a few moments. I shall not interrupt you long.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘We have been talking a good deal,’ said Laurence, ‘about the signs of the
                        times.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And,’ said Lady Ambrose eagerly, feeling herself near a friend, ‘about all
                        this wicked infidelity and irreligion that is so much about in the world
                        now.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, yes,’ said Dr. Seydon slowly, and with a sudden frown, ‘it is true,
                        unhappily, that there is, or has been, much of that in our century. But what
                        remains is confined, I imagine (and that is sad enough, God knows) to the
                        half educated artisans in our large towns, whom the Church in former years,
                        alas! relaxed her hold on. For I fear I cannot deny that we, in this matter,
                        are not wholly guiltless. The Church, we may depend upon it, has much to
                        answer for.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Perfectly true, my dear sir! perfectly true,’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, who could
                        never resist assenting to this sentiment. </p>
                    <p> Dr. Seydon darted a quick glance at Mr. Luke, as if he were anything but
                        pleased at finding himself so readily agreed with. </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ he went on, ‘matters are fast assuming a more satisfactory
                        appearance; and the great advance made in true education, and the liberal
                        spirit that this brings with it, cannot fail to lead to that great change in
                        our position that we so much desiderate.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Quite so,’ said Mr. Luke. ‘The true reading of ecclesiastical history—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ exclaimed Dr. Seydon, holding up his forefinger, ‘exactly so. You have
                        hit upon the right thing there.’ (‘Good gracious!’ thought Mr. Luke,
                        astounded at this patronising compliment, ‘I should think I had.’) ‘Could we
                        but get both the parties,’ Dr. Seydon went on, addressing Mr. Luke across
                        Lady Ambrose, ‘to understand fairly the history of the important era, the
                        matter would, I think, be as good as settled. You see,’ he said, turning to
                        Lady Ambrose, ‘if the Easterns will merely face steadily the pregnant fact
                        that Michael Cerularius, in his first letter to Leo IX., in 1053, took
                        absolutely no exception to any one point in Western doctrine, but simply to
                        certain secondary points of discipline, they will see that the gulf that
                        separates us is very slight when viewed by the clearer light of modern
                        thought. I think,’ he added, ‘that I saw Lady Ambrose’s name amongst the
                        subscribers to the Eastern Church Union Association.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh yes,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘certainly. I do so wish that some union could
                        be brought about. For the Greek Church, you know, certainly have the
                        Apostolical Succession; and then, if we were only joined with them, the
                        Roman Catholics could never deny our orders—not,’ she added, with a most
                        cordial smile to Dr. Seydon, ‘that I don’t myself believe implicitly in
                        them, as it is.’ </p>
                    <p> A rapid frown gathered itself on Dr. Seydon’s brow. </p>
                    <p> ‘The denial of them,’ he said severely, ‘hurts the Romanists far more than
                        it does us. As to the Greeks, what I was going to say was this. Let them
                        just cast their eyes so far as the tenth century, and they will see—and pray
                        mark this, all of you,’ he said, holding up his forefinger, and shaking it
                        several times, ‘for this is very important—I say the Greeks will see, unless
                        they are determined to close their eyes, that at the time of the great
                        rupture with the West, they did actually acknowledge the entire soundness of
                        our confession of faith; the main point they objected to, and which they
                        thought fit ground then for separation, being that the Western Church did
                        not sing Alleluiah in Lent, and that it used in the Lord’s Supper unleavened
                        bread, which, Nicetas Pectoratus contended in an elaborate treatise, was
                        dead bread, and could not therefore be either supersubstantial or
                        consubstantial to us. It has been the fault of the Easterns, in fact, to be
                        ever over-subtle, and to fall into those excesses of human wisdom which are
                        foolishness with God. Isaac the Armenian, for instance, wrote a book to
                        prove his countrymen in heresy for twenty-nine different reasons, of which
                        the two most important are these—<hi>that they did not blow on baptised
                            persons</hi>, and <hi>that they made their consecrated oils of rapeseed
                            and not of olives</hi>. But two causes seem to me to be now working
                        together, under God, to put the Easterns into a more becoming spirit, and to
                        make them more heartily willing to join us. These are—I have mentioned them
                        in the third volume of my “History of the <hi>Filioque</hi> Clause”—first,
                        that the genuine Greek blood is becoming daily more adulterated, and the
                        Greek intellect losing therefore its old subtlety; and secondly, that the
                        political disturbance that now seems imminent in the East, will distract
                        them from abusing such subtlety as they still possess. We shall therefore
                        meet on the broad ground of our fundamental agreements; and once let the
                        moral influence of the two churches, the Greek and English, be mutually
                        augmented by an open union, in another five years, I imagine, we shall have
                        heard the last of infidelity, in England at least, or indeed of Romanism
                        either.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Now, that’s the sort of man,’ said Lady Ambrose, as soon as Dr. Seydon had
                        departed, ‘that I should like to have for my clergyman in our new Republic.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Seydon!’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, ‘so that is he, is it? I thought I remembered
                        that face of his. Of course—I remember now, seeing that his college had
                        given this living to him.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It was he,’ said Laurence to Miss Merton, ‘who, some years ago, prevented
                        Dr. Jenkinson being made a bishop, which he said, though it might be a
                        compliment to learning, would be a grievous insult to God.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And so, Lady Ambrose,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘you would like Dr. Seydon for a
                        clergyman! Well, in our ideal society you would be able to have any
                        clergyman you chose—any religion you chose—any which most satisfied your own
                        conscience.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh, very well,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘if it would not interfere with one’s
                        religion in any way, I think all this culture and enlightenment most
                        delightful.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It will bind us to nothing,’ said Mr. Stockton, ‘except to a recognition of
                        nobleness, of morality, of poetry. What Mr. Laurence has offered to read to
                        us is an account of how all of these are bound up in religion in <hi>my</hi>
                        sense of the word.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Come, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘please go on. It is wonderful,’
                        she added in a solemn whisper, ‘how even bad men, like old Mr. Laurence,
                        know at heart how it is really best to be good, and to believe in true
                        religion.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘<hi>As I grow old, my dear Otho</hi>,’ Laurence again began to read, ‘I<hi>
                            am coming to think over many things that I have hitherto thought too
                            little about, and, amongst others, the great mystery of Christianity. I
                            am coming to see that, from a too superficial way of looking at it, I
                            have done this religion a gross injustice, and have blindly failed to
                            recognise how much of all that we hold most precious in life is
                            dependent on its severe and unbending systems of theology and morals. It
                            will perhaps strike you that it is rather late in the day for me to pay
                            my tribute to these, now that the world at large is theoretically
                            denying the former of them, and is practically forgetting the latter.
                            But it is this very fact that induces me to speak out—the growing
                            licence and the growing scepticism of modern society. I wish to raise my
                            voice against the present state of things, and to warn the world that if
                            it goes on much longer as it is going on now, it will soon have
                            irremediably ruined all the finer and more piquant flavours of life, and
                            that soon there will be actually nothing left to give rational zest to
                            this poor pitiful existence of ours. </hi></p>

                            ancients, and how, in many ways, I think modern civilisation barbarous
                            as compared with theirs. I have not changed this opinion. I have only
                            come lately to understand what it means. The charm of ancient life lies
                            mainly in its form. In essence, the life open to us is, as I fully see
                            now, infinitely superior. And to what is this superiority due? Simply to
                            Christianity. It came with Christianity, and it will also go with it.

                    <p>
                        <hi>‘To begin, then—just consider the one matter of humour. Compare the
                            ancient humourists with the modern. Think for a moment of Lucian, of
                            Aristophanes, of Plautus, of Petronius, of Horace; then think of
                            Erasmus, Swift, Cervantes, Voltaire, Sterne. Does not the mere memory of
                            the two sets of names bring home to you what a gulf in this matter there
                            is between the ancient world and the modern? Is not the modern humour an
                            altogether different thing from the ancient—broader and deeper beyond
                            comparison or measurement? The humour of the ancients could raise a
                            laugh; true—that is just what it could raise, and a laugh could express
                            all the feelings raised by it. Think of the intolerable vulgarity of
                            Homers gods, who “laughed consumedly” at Vulcan, as he waited on
                            them,—why? because he was lame. The sense of humour on Olympus was about
                            equal to what it would be now in a country lawyer’s Parlour. Think of
                            Horace, who saw in a dull pun on two proper names, a joke so excellent
                            that he wrote a whole satire in honour of it. It is true that Juvenal
                            showed a somewhat finer sense, when he said that when Fortune was
                            pleased to be facetious, she made a</hi> nouveau riche; <hi>Petronius,
                            perhaps, was even in advance of Juvenal. But ancient humour at its best
                            was a shallow thing. It meant little. It was like the bright sparkle on
                            a brawling stream, hardly ankle-deep But our modern humour is like the
                            silent snake-like lights in a still water, that go coiling down into
                            depths unfathomable, as it lures our thoughts onwards to the
                            contemplation of endless issues. The twinkle in the eyes of a Sterne or
                            a Cervantes seems to hint to us of Eleusinian mysteries with a
                            triumphant solemn treachery; and wakes our souls, as we catch it, into a
                            sudden, thrill of delicious furtive insight. Such humour as this may
                            excite laughter; but no laughter can ease our feelings fully—they also
                            demand tears; and even tears are not enough for us. Of such humour as
                            this the ancients had hardly a notion; it differs from theirs as the man
                            differs from the baby, and seems almost like a new sense, peculiar to
                            the modern world. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Now, to what is this development of humour due—this new and exquisite
                            source of pleasure? Simply, as you must see, if you look into the
                            matter, to that much maligned thing, Christianity, and that marvellous
                            system of moral laws and restraints which, although accredited through
                            imposture, elaborated by barbarism, and received by credulity, has
                            entirely changed the whole complexion of life. Think how it has done
                            this. It has slowly permeated and penetrated all man's inner existence.
                            It has given him new unearthly aims; it has given him new unearthly
                            standards by which to measure every action. It has cunningly associated
                            everything with the most awful or the most glittering conceptions with
                            which the imagination can scare or intoxicate itself—with Hell, Heaven,
                            Judgment, and so forth: and thus there is scarcely a single choice or
                            refusal that has been left indifferent, and not more or less nearly
                            connected with the most stupendous issues. The infinitely beautiful, the
                            infinitely terrible, the infinitely hateful meet us everywhere.
                            Everything is enchanted, and seems to be what it is not. The enchantment
                            quite deludes the vulgar; it a little deludes the wise; but the wise are
                            for ever in various ways secretly undoing the spell, and getting
                            glimpses of things as they really are. What a delight these glimpses are
                            to those that get them! Here lies the sense of humour—in the detection
                            of truth through revered and reigning falsehood. Think of the colloquies
                            of Erasmus, and his Laus Stultitiæ—there is an instance for you. Think
                            of Don Quixote—there is another. All its humour is due to Christian
                            dreams of honour, duty and chivalry. Who, again, would have cared for
                            Swift’s showing us that man was hateful, if Christ had not bewitched us
                            into thinking that man was loveable? Gulliver owes its point to the
                            Gospels. Sterne sees everything “big with infinite jest.” But why?
                            Because Christianity has made everything big also with infinite
                            solemnity. A possible moral meaning is secreted over the whole surface
                            of life, like the scented oil in the cells on the surface of an orange
                            skin, The humourist catches the perfume of these volatile oils, as they
                            are crushed out and wasted by our every action. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Think, too, by the way, of the kindred subject of wit. I was reading a
                            play of Congreve’s yesterday: and this made me reflect how nearly all
                            the brightest wit of the modern world consists in showing us this one
                            thing—that fidelity in marriage is ridiculous; that is, in showing us
                            what, but for Christianity, no one would ever have doubted. Such wit is,
                            as it were, the forbidden kiss we give to common sense, from which an
                            angry religion has been bent on separating us. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Think, too, of that flower of Christian civilisation, the innuendo.
                            That is simply the adroit saying under difficulties of what, but for
                            Christianity, everyone would have taken for granted. </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘Here, then, you see, are the wit, the innuendo, the humour of the
                            world, all owing their existence, or, at any rate, their flavour, to
                            Christianity. And what would life, what would conversation be without
                            these? But it is not these only that we owe to the same source. All our
                            finer pleasures are indebted for their chief taste to it likewise. Love
                            in itself, for instance, is, as everyone knows who has felt it, the
                            coarsest and most foolish of all our feelings. Leave it free to do what
                            it pleases, and we soon cease to care what it does. But Christianity,
                            with a miraculous ingenuity, has confined and cramped it into so
                            grotesque and painful a posture, and set such vigilant guardians to keep
                            it there, that any return to its natural freedom is a rapture, an
                            adventure, and a truimph, which none but the wisest and most skilful can
                            compass with grace or safety, and which wise men, therefore, think worth
                            compassing. It is indeed the same with all the natural and true
                            pleasures of life—poor tasteless things not worth living for, in
                            themselves; but they have been so hidden away from us, and have come to
                            be in such bad odour with the world, that only the wisest—for wisdom is
                            but the detection of falsehood—see that they may be taken, and have the
                            courage to take them; and the wisdom they are conscious of in doing
                            this, forms a delicious </hi>sauce piquante<hi>—(of which humour, wit,
                            and so on, are some of the flavours)—to these same poor pleasures, that
                            can give us a real zest for them. </hi></p>

                        <hi>‘Such a life of wisdom is, of course, only for the few. The wise must
                            always be few, as the rich must. The poor must make fine food for the
                            rich to eat. The fools must make fine follies for the wise to detect. We
                            cannot all be happy in a rational way. It is at least best that some of
                            us should be. But what I want to point out to you, my boy, is, that if
                            society goes on as it is going on now, nobody will be able soon to be
                            rationally happy at all. It is true that I do not now live much in the
                            world; but I have sufficient means of seeing the course it is taking. I,
                            like Hamlet, have heard of its “paintings,” how it “jigs and ambles and
                            lisps, and nick-names God’s creatures.” I know how fast all Christian
                            moral sentiment is silently dying out of it. Indeed, so rapid do I
                            imagine to be the way in which it is losing all proper feeling, that I
                            should not be surprised were society in another five years, if I am not
                            dead by that time, to receive me back again. Now, as long as
                            Christianity was firmly fixed as a faith, we might amuse ourselves by
                            offending against its morals as much as we liked; for our acts were in
                            no danger of losing their forbidden character. There would always be a
                            persecution, under which pleasure might thrive. But now, since faith is
                            dead, we have only the moral sentiments left to us; and if we once get
                            rid of these by a too reckless violation of them, the whole work of
                            Christianity, which I have been trying to explain to you, will be
                            undone. Wit and humour, love and poetry, will all alike have left us.
                            Life will have lost its seasonings and its sauces: and served up to us
                        </hi>au naturel<hi> it will only nauseate us. Man, indeed, will then be only
                            separated from the animals by his capacity for ennui. </hi></p>

                    <p>
                        <hi>‘To me, of course, all this matters little. Such flavours as life has,
                            have lasted me this far; nor will the world’s growing blankness affect
                            me. I shall never look into a woman’s eyes again. One of my own is blind
                            now, and the other is so dim that I doubt if the best-paid beauty could
                            contrive to look into it with more than an ironical tenderness. All this
                            matters nothing to me. But you, my boy—what will be left for you, when I
                            am taken away from the evil that is to come? Your prospect does not seem
                            to me a cheerful one. But alas! I can offer no remedy. I can only
                            beguile my time by warning you. At any rate, it is always good to think
                            a little about the roots of things: so I trust you will be in some way
                            profited by these</hi> patruæ verbera linguæ.’ </p>
                    <p> When Laurence closed the book there was a silence of some moments, as if no
                        one knew exactly how to take what had just been read. But at last Donald
                        Gordon exclaimed, in his devoutest of soft whispers: ‘Is Saul also among the
                        prophets?’ The words acted like a spell; the ice was broken, and Mr.
                        Herbert, who hitherto had hardly uttered a syllable the whole afternoon, now
                        broke out suddenly in his most emphatic accents. </p>
                    <p> ‘Thank you, my dear Laurence,’ he exclaimed; ‘thank you much, indeed. There
                        is something in what you have just read us that seems to me quite precious
                        and peculiar. Nor do I find any such honesty in any creed sung by priests in
                        churches, as I do in this sardonic confession of that great truth, which the
                        present age as a whole is resolutely bent upon forgetting—that the grand
                        knowledge for a man to know is the essential and eternal difference between
                        right and wrong, between base and noble; that there <hi>is</hi> a right and
                        a noble to be striven for, not for the sake of its consequences, but in
                        spite of them; and that it is this fact alone which, under countless forms,
                        is the one thing affirmed in all human art and implied in all serviceable
                        learning, Your Cervantes smiles it to you; your Swift curses it to you; your
                        Bernard of Morlaix hymns it to you; your saddened Shakespeare tells it to
                        you in every way. Strange indeed is it, and mournful, that we see a time
                        when the one truth that we live and die by not only needs to be pointed out
                        to us, but asserted passionately in the teeth of those whom we have elected
                        as our wisest teachers.’ Mr. Saunders at once took this to be a special
                        allusion to himself, and his face involuntarily began to array itself in a
                        smile of triumph. ‘However,’ Mr. Herbert went on benignantly, ‘you have
                        truly gone the right way to work in constructing an ideal society, if you
                        make it recognise this before all things, and see how witness is borne to it
                        by every pleasure and every interest of life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, yes,’ exclaimed Mr. Stockton, ‘it is just this noble discrimination
                        between right and wrong, Mr. Herbert, that modern enlightenment will so
                        preeminently encourage and foster. Morality is quite indispensable to any
                        dream of the future. And as to religion—the motto of the future is
                        freedom—holy awful, individual freedom. We shall each be free to choose or
                        evolve the religion most profoundly suited to us.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘as long as I may keep my own religion, I shall
                        be quite satisfied; and about other people, I really don’t think I’m
                        bigoted—not as long, you know, as they belong to <hi>some</hi> church. But
                            <hi>religion</hi> is the thing I want. Of course we <hi>must</hi> have
                        morality. Mustn’t we?’ she added, with a half-puzzled expression, turning to
                        Lady Grace. </p>
                    <p> ‘Must!’ sighed Mrs. Sinclair. ‘It’s very easy to say <hi>must</hi>.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course we must,’ said Lady Grace cheerfully. ‘My dear,’ she went on,
                        with a little kindly laugh towards Mr. Saunders, ‘he doesn’t really doubt
                        it.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Saunders sprang to his feet as if an adder had stung him. </p>
                    <p> ‘What!’ he exclaimed, standing in the centre of the group, and looking round
                        him, ‘and do I not really doubt that the degrading practice of prayer, the
                        fetish-worship of celibacy, of mortification, and so forth—do I not doubt
                        that the foul faith in a future life, the grotesque conceptions of the
                        theological virtues, and that preposterous idol of the marketplace, the
                        sanctity of marriage,—do you think I do not really doubt that we must retain
                        these? Do you think, on the contrary, I do not know that they are already
                        doomed? However,’ here Mr. Saunders paused suddenly and again sat down on
                        the grass, ‘there is no need for me at this moment to destroy any cherished
                        illusions; though I shall be happy to show my analysis of them that I spoke
                        about just now to anyone who is not afraid to inspect it. I hear much said
                        about tolerance, as a characteristic of your society. All I ask is, that you
                        have the courage to extend your tolerance to me. Your new Republic may be
                        full of illusions then. The great labour of destroying them will be
                        positively <hi>delicious</hi> to me.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Mr. Stockton, with a mixture of deference and patronage, ‘and
                        what does Miss Merton think?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh,’ said Miss Merton with a slow smile, ‘I am all in favour of toleration.
                        I think that what I consider truth is quite good enough to stand on its own
                        merits, if unprejudiced eyes can only be got to see them. And I honestly do
                        think, that with really high-breeding, and with what we apparently mean by
                        culture, we should have at least one part of the world as good as we could
                        wish it. But yet—’ she added, hesitating a little, ‘we have surely settled
                        only half the question yet. We have said a good deal about this wide and
                        discerning taste that is to guide us, We have not said much yet about the
                        particular things—the occupations, the duties, the pleasures, that it will
                        lead us to choose.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ began Mr. Rose, ‘I should like myself very much to say something as to
                        that—as to the new pleasures that modern culture has made possible for us.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Suppose—’ said Lady Ambrose with one of her most beaming smiles, as she
                        pushed her hat away over the back of her head, ‘suppose we talk of this
                        by-and-by—at dinner, or in the evening. Let us just <hi>enjoy</hi> a little
                        now. The air now is so truly delicious. It seems quite like a sin, doesn’t
                        it, to think of going in to dinner by-and-by.’ </p>
                    <p> A happy thought struck Lady Grace. </p>
                    <p> ‘Suppose we have dinner out of doors, Otho,’ she said, ‘in the pavilion with
                        the roses round it that you used to call the summer dining-room.’ </p>
                    <p> This proposal was received with what was little short of rapture. ‘That
                        really would be too delightful!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose. ‘And what place
                        could sound more perfect for us to finish our new Republic in!’ It was
                        arranged accordingly. </p>
                    <p> ‘And now,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose to Laurence confidentially, as the
                        conversation ceased to be general, ‘I want you to let me have a look at that
                        book of your uncle’s. I have often heard it spoken about. Lord Heartpool had
                        a copy, which he showed my poor father in Paris. Come, Mr. Laurence, you
                        need not hold it back. I’m sure there’s nothing in it that would do me any
                        harm.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well—no,’ said Laurence; ‘in this volume I don’t think there is.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Because what you read just now,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘was all really in
                        favour of goodness, though it is true I didn’t quite like the tone of some
                        of it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What,’ interposed Mr. Rose, ‘is there another volume? I should much like to
                        see that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I declare, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose, who had now got the book in
                        her hand, ‘here’s something really quite pretty— at least, I’ve only got as
                        far as the first verse yet. It’s a little poem called “<hi>To the Wife of an
                            old Schoolfellow</hi>.”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Read it out to us—do,’ said Laurence, with a soft smile. ‘It will
                        illustrate very well the letter we had just now.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you know, I really think I <hi>might</hi> manage this,’ she said,
                        ‘although I’m not in the least by way of being a reader out. Listen, then,
                        and please don’t laugh at me.’ </p>

                    <p> As Lady Ambrose had read on, her voice had grown more and more disapproving,
                        and several times she had shown symptoms of being on the point of stopping. </p>
                    <p> ‘I’ve no doubt it’s all very witty,’ she said, putting down the book, which
                        was eagerly caught up by Mr. Rose, ‘but—but that sort of thing, you know,’
                        she exclaimed at last, ‘I think is rather better in the smoking-room.
                        However, I saw something next to those verses, that I think would suit Miss
                        Merton. It seemed to be a sort of address to the Virgin Mary.’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton looked a little embarrassed; Laurence looked astonished. </p>
                    <p> ‘Let me read it,’ exclaimed Mr. Rose, rapidly turning over the pages. ‘This
                        must be what Lady Ambrose means, I think:— <quote>

                    <p> ‘Oh,’ said Laurence, ‘that is not my uncle’s; it is mine. It is the earliest
                        copy of verses I ever wrote. I was seventeen then, and by an odd freak my
                        uncle printed them in the end of his own collection.’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton’s embarrassment in a great measure disappeared. She looked
                        interested; and Mr. Rose, in slow, suave tones went on to read:— </p>

                    <p> ‘Ah, they are sweet verses,’ said Mr. Rose; ‘a little too ascetic, perhaps,
                        to be quite Greek. They are from Euripides, I see—the address to Artemis of
                        Hippolytus.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Laurence; ‘I don’t think I ever wrote any original poetry.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It’s exactly like Mr. Laurence—that bit,’ whispered Mrs. Sinclair. </p>
                    <p> ‘And now,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘as I suppose we shall ere long be all going to
                        dress for dinner, I will go, Mr. Laurence, if you will let me, and examine
                        that other volume you spoke of, of your uncle’s Miscellanies.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose moved slowly away; and as he did so, there came the sound of the
                        distant dressing-bell, which warned the whole party that it was time to be
                        following his example. </p>

                    <p> NO proposal could have been happier than Lady Grace’s, of the garden banquet
                        in the pavilion. It seemed to the guests, when they were all assembled
                        there, that the lovely summer’s day was going to close with a scene from
                        fairyland. The table itself, with its flowers, and glowing fruit, and its
                        many-coloured Venetian glass, shone and gleamed and sparkled, in the evening
                        light, that was turning outside to a cool mellow amber; and above, from the
                        roof, in which the dusk was already darkness, hung china lamps, in the shape
                        of green and purple grape-clusters, looking like luminous fruits stolen from
                        Aladdin’s garden. The pavilion, open on all sides, was supported on marble
                        pillars, that were almost hidden in red and white roses. Behind, the eye
                        rested on great tree-trunks, and glades of rich foliage; and before, it
                        would pass over turf and flowers, till it reached the sea beyond, on which,
                        in another hour, the faint silver of the moonlight would begin to tremble. </p>
                    <p> There was something in the whole scene that was at once calming and
                        exhilarating; and nearly all present seemed to feel in some measure this
                        double effect of it. Dr. Jenkinson had been quite restored by an afternoon’s
                        nap; and his face was now all a-twinkle with a fresh benignity, that had
                        however, like an early spring morning, just a faint suspicion of frost in
                        it. Mr. Storks even was less severe than usual; and as he raised his
                        champagne to his lips, he would at times look very nearly conversational. </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear Laurence,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert, ‘it really almost seems as if
                        your visions of the afternoon had come true, and that we actually were in
                        your new Republic already. I can only say that, if it is at all like this,
                        it will be an entirely charming place—too charming, perhaps. But now,
                        remember this—you have but half got through the business to which you first
                        addressed yourselves—that of forming a picture of a perfect aristocracy—an
                        aristocracy in the true and genuine sense of the word. You are all to have
                        culture, or taste. Very good, you have talked a great deal about that, and
                        you have seen what you mean by it; and you have recognised, above all, that
                        it includes a discrimination between right and wrong. But now, you with all
                        this taste and culture—you gifted men and women of the nineteenth
                        century,—what sort of things does your taste teach you to reach out towards?
                        In what actions and aims, in what affections and emotions, would you place
                        your happiness? That is what I want to hear—the practical manifestations of
                        this culture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘I have at this moment a series of essays in the press,
                        which would go far towards answering these questions of yours. They do,
                        indeed, deal with just this—the effect of the choicer culture of this
                        century on the soul of man—the ways in which it endows him with new
                        perceptions—how it has made him, in fact, a being altogether more highly
                        organised. All I regret is, that these choicer souls, these χαρίεντες, are
                        as yet like flowers that have not found a climate in which they can thrive
                        properly. That mental climate will doubtless come with time. What we have
                        been trying to do this afternoon is, I imagine, nothing more than to
                        anticipate it in imagination.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Mr. Herbert, with a little the tone of an inquisitor, ‘that is
                        just what I have been asking. What will this climate be like, and what will
                        these flowers be like in this climate? How would your culture alter and
                        better the present, if its powers were equal to its wishes?’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose’s soft lulling tone harmonised well with the scene and hour, and
                        the whole party seemed willing to listen to him; or at any rate no one felt
                        any prompting to interrupt him. </p>
                    <p> ‘I can show you an example, Mr. Herbert,’ he said, ‘of culture demanding a
                        finer climate, in—if you will excuse my seeming egoism—in myself. For
                        instance, (to take the widest matter I can fix upon—the general outward
                        surroundings of our lives), often, when I walk about London, and see how
                        hideous its whole external aspect is, and what a dissonant population throng
                        it, a chill feeling of despair comes over me. Consider how the human eye
                        delights in form and colour, and the ear in tempered and harmonious sounds;
                        and then think for a moment of a London street! Think of the shapeless
                        houses, the forest of ghastly chimney-pots, of the hell of distracting
                        noises made by the carts, the cabs, the carriages—think of the bustling,
                        commonplace, careworn crowds that jostle you—think of an omnibus—think of a
                        four-wheeler—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I often ride in an omnibus,’ said Lord Allen, with a slight smile to Miss
                        Merton. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is true,’ replied Mr. Rose, only overhearing the tone in which these
                        words were said, ‘that one may ever and again catch some touch of sunlight
                        that will for a moment make the meanest object beautiful with its furtive
                        alchemy. But that is Nature’s work, not man’s; and we must never confound
                        the accidental beauty that Nature will bestow on man’s work, even at its
                        worst, with the rational and designed beauty of man’s work at its best. It
                        is this rational human beauty that I say our modern city life is so
                        completely wanting in; nay, the look of out-of-door London seems literally
                        to stifle the very power of imagining such beauty possible. Indeed, as I
                        wander along our streets, pushing my way among the throngs of faces—faces
                        puckered with misdirected thought, or expressionless with none—barbarous
                        faces set towards Parliament, or Church, or scientific lecture-rooms, or
                        Government offices, or counting-houses—I say, as I push my way amongst all
                        the sights and sounds of the streets of our great city, only one thing ever
                        catches my eye, that breaks in upon my mood, and warns me I need not
                        despair.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And what is that?’ asked Allen, with some curiosity. </p>
                    <p> ‘The shops,’ Mr. Rose answered, ‘of certain of our upholsterers and dealers
                        in works of art. Their windows, as I look into them, act like a sudden charm
                        on me—like a splash of cold water dashed on my forehead when I am fainting.
                        For I seem there to have got a glimpse of the real heart of things; and as
                        my eyes rest on the perfect pattern (many of which are really quite
                        delicious; indeed, when I go to ugly houses, I often take a scrap of some
                        artistic crétonne with me in my pocket as a kind of æsthetic smelling
                        salts), I say, when I look in at their windows, and my eyes rest on the
                        perfect pattern of some new fabric for a chair or for a window-curtain, or
                        on some new design for a wallpaper, or on some old china vase, I become at
                        once sharply conscious, Mr. Herbert, that, despite the ungenial mental
                        climate of the present age, strange yearnings for, and knowledge of, true
                        beauty, are beginning to show themselves like flowers above the weedy soil;
                        and I remember, amidst the roar and clatter of our streets, and the mad
                        noises of our own times, that there is amongst us a growing number who have
                        deliberately turned their backs on all these things, and have thrown their
                        whole souls and sympathies into the happier art-ages of the past. They have
                        gone back,’ said Mr. Rose, raising his voice a little, ‘to Athens and to
                        Italy, to the Italy of Leo and to the Athens of Pericles. To such men the
                        clamour, the interests, the struggles of our own times, become as
                        meaningless as they really are. To them the boyhood of Bathyllus is of more
                        moment than the manhood of Napoleon. Borgia is a more familiar name than
                        Bismarck. I know, indeed—and I really do not blame them—several
                        distinguished artists who, resolving to make their whole lives consistently
                        perfect, will, on principle, never admit a newspaper into their houses that
                        is of later date than the times of Addison; and I have good trust that the
                        number of such men is on the increase—men I mean,’ said Mr. Rose, toying
                        tenderly with an exquisite wine-glass of Salviati’s, ‘who with a steady and
                        set purpose follow art for the sake of art, beauty for the sake of beauty,
                        love for the sake of love, life for the sake of life.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose’s slow gentle voice, which was apt at certain times to become
                        peculiarly irritating, sounded now like the evening air grown articulate,
                        and had secured him hitherto a tranquil hearing, as if by a kind of spell.
                        This however seemed here in sudden danger of snapping. </p>
                    <p> ‘What, Mr. Rose!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, ‘do you mean to say, then, that
                        the number of people is on the increase who won’t read the newspapers?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Why, the men must be absolute idiots!’ said Lady Grace, shaking her grey
                        curls, and putting on her spectacles to look at Mr. Rose. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose however was imperturbable. </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course,’ he said, ‘you may have newspapers if you will: I myself always
                        have them; though in general they are too full of public events to be of
                        much interest. I was merely speaking just now of the spirit of the movement.
                        And of that we must all of us here have some knowledge. We must all of us
                        have friends whose houses more or less embody it. And even if we had not, we
                        could not help seeing signs of it—signs of how true and earnest it is, in
                        the enormous sums that are now given for really good objects.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That,’ said Lady Grace, with some tartness, ‘is true enough, thank God!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But I can’t see,’ said Lady Ambrose, whose name often figured in the
                            <hi>Times</hi>, in the subscription-lists of advertised charities— ‘I
                        can’t see, Mr. Rose, any reason in that why we should not read the
                        newspapers.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The other day, for instance,’ said Mr. Rose reflectively, ‘I heard of eight
                        Chelsea shepherdesses, picked up by a dealer, I really forget where—in some
                        common cottage, if I recollect aright, covered with dirt, giving no pleasure
                        to anyone—and these were all sold in a single day, and not one of them
                        fetched less than two hundred and twenty pounds.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘<hi>I</hi> can’t help thinking they must have come from Cremorne,’ said
                        Mrs. Sinclair softly. </p>
                    <p> ‘But why,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘should I speak of particular instances? We
                            <hi>must</hi> all of us have friends whose houses are full of priceless
                        treasures such as these—the whole atmosphere of whose rooms really seems
                        impregnated with art—seems in fact, Mr. Herbert, such an atmosphere as we
                        should dream of for our new Republic.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘To be sure,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, feeling that she had at last got upon
                        solid ground. ‘By the way, Mr. Rose,’ she said, with her most gracious of
                        smiles, ‘I suppose you have hardly seen Lady Julia Hayman’s new house in
                        Belgrave Square? I’m sure that would delight you. I should like to take you
                        there some day, and show it to you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I have seen it,’ said Mr. Rose, with languid condescension. ‘It was very
                        pretty, I thought—some of it really quite nice.’ </p>
                    <p> This and the slight rudeness of manner it was said with, raised Mr. Rose
                        greatly in Lady Ambrose’s estimation, and she began to think with respect of
                        his late utterances. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, Mr. Herbert,’ Mr. Rose went on, ‘what I want to say is this. We have
                        here in the present age, as it is, fragments of the right thing. We have a
                        number of isolated right interiors; we have a few, very few right exteriors.
                        But in our ideal state, our entire city—our London—the metropolis of our
                        society, would be as a whole as perfect as these fragments. Taste would not
                        there be merely an indoor thing. It would be written visibly for all to look
                        upon, in our streets, our squares, our gardens. Could we only mould England
                        to our wishes, the thing to do, I am persuaded, would be to remove London to
                        some kindlier site, that it might there be altogether born anew. I myself
                        would have it taken to the south-west, and to the sea-coast, where the waves
                        are blue, and where the air is calm and fine, and there—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah me!’ sighed Mr. Luke with a lofty sadness, ‘<hi>cœlum non animam
                            mutant</hi>.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Pardon me,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘few paradoxes—and most paradoxes are false—are,
                        I think, so false as that. This much at least of sea-like man’s mind has,
                        that scarcely anything so distinctly gives a tone to it as the colour of the
                        skies he lives under. And I was going to say,’ he went on, looking out
                        dreamily towards the evening waves, ‘that as the imagination is a quick
                        workman, I can at this moment see our metropolis already transplanted and
                        rebuilt. I seem to see it now as it were from a distance, with its palaces,
                        its museums, its churches, its convents, its gardens, its
                        picture-galleries—a cluster of domed and pillared marble, sparkling on a
                        gray headland. It is Rome, it is Athens, it is Florence, arisen and come to
                        life again, in these modern days. The aloe-tree of beauty again blossoms
                        there, under the azure stainless sky.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you know, Mr. Rose,’ said Lady Ambrose in her most cordial manner, ‘all
                        this is <hi>very</hi> beautiful; and certainly no one can think London as it
                        is more ugly than I do. That’s natural in me, isn’t it, being a denizen of
                        poor prosaic South Audley Street as I am? But don’t you think that your
                        notion is—it’s very beautiful, I quite feel that—but don’t you think it is
                        perhaps a little too dream-like—too unreal, if you know what I mean?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Such a city,’ said Mr. Rose earnestly, ‘is indeed a dream, but it is a
                        dream which we might make a reality, would circumstances only permit of it.
                        We have many amongst us who know what is beautiful, and who passionately
                        desire it; and would others only be led by these, it is quite conceivable
                        that we might some day have a capital, the entire aspect of which should be
                        the visible embodiment of our finest and most varied culture, our most
                        sensitive taste, and our deepest æsthetic measure of things. This is what
                        this capital of our new Republic must be, this dwelling-place of our ideal
                        society. We shall have houses, galleries, streets, theatres, such as Giulio
                        Romano or Giorgio Vasari, or Giulio Campi would have rejoiced to look at; we
                        shall have metal-work worthy of the hand of Ghiberti and the praise of
                        Michel Angelo; we shall rival Domenico Beccafumi with our pavements. As you
                        wander through our thoroughfares and our gardens, your feelings will not be
                        jarred by the presence of human vulgarity, or the desolating noise of
                        traffic; nor in every spare space will your eyes be caught by abominable
                        advertisements of excursion trains to Brighton, or of Horniman’s cheap tea.
                        They will rest instead, here on an exquisite fountain, here on a statue,
                        here on a bust of Zeus or Hermes or Aphrodite, glimmering in a laurelled
                        nook; or on a Mater Dolorosa looking down on you from her holy shrine; or on
                        the carved marble gate-posts of our palace gardens, or on their wrought iron
                        or wrought bronze gates; or perhaps on such triumphal arches as that which
                        Antonio San Gallo constructed in honour of Charles V., and of which you must
                        all remember the description given by Vasari. Such a city,’ said Mr. Rose,
                        ‘would be the externalisation of the human spirit in the highest state of
                        development that we can conceive for it. We should there see expressed
                        openly all our appreciations of all the beauty that we can detect in the
                        world’s whole history. The wind of the spirit that breathed there would blow
                        to us from all the places of the past, and be charged with infinite odours.
                        Every frieze on our walls, every clustered capital of a marble column, would
                        be a garland or nosegay of associations. Indeed, our whole city, as compared
                        with the London that is now, would be itself a nosegay as compared with a
                        faggot; and as related to the life that I would see lived in it, it would be
                        like a shell murmuring with all the world’s memories, and held to the ear of
                        the two twins, Life and Love.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose had got so dreamy by this time that he felt himself the necessity
                        of turning a little more matter-of-fact again. </p>
                    <p> ‘You will see what I mean, plainly enough,’ he said, ‘if you will just think
                        of our architecture, and consider how that naturally will be—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘I should be glad to hear about our architecture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘—How that naturally will be,’ Mr. Rose went on, ‘of no style in
                        particular.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The deuce it won’t!’ exclaimed Mr. Luke. </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ continued Mr. Rose, unmoved; ‘no style in particular, but a
                            <hi>renaissance</hi> of all styles. It will matter nothing to us whether
                        they be pagan or Catholic, classical or mediæval. We shall be quite without
                        prejudice or bigotry. To the eye of true taste, an Aquinas in his cell
                        before a crucifix, or a Narcissus gazing at himself in a still fountain,
                        are—in their own ways, you know—equally beautiful.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, really,’ said Miss Merton, ‘I can <hi>not</hi> fancy St. Thomas being
                        a very taking object to people who don’t believe in him either as a saint or
                        a philosopher. I always think that, except from a Christian point of view, a
                        saint can be hardly better described than by Newman’s lines, as— <quote><l>
                                A bundle of bones, whose breath</l><l> Infects the world before his
                                death.’</l></quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘I remember the lines well,’ said Mr. Rose calmly, ‘and the writer you
                        mention puts them in the mouth of a yelping devil. But devils, as far as I
                        know, are not generally—except, perhaps, Milton’s—conspicuous for taste:
                        indeed, if we may trust Goethe, the very touch of a flower is torture to
                        them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Dante’s biggest devil,’ cried Mr. Saunders, to everyone’s amazement,
                        ‘chewed Judas Iscariot like a quid of tobacco, to all eternity. He, at any
                        rate, knew what he liked.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose started, and visited Mr. Saunders with a rapid frown. He then
                        proceeded, turning again to Miss Merton as if nothing had happened. </p>
                    <p> ‘Let me rather,’ he said, ‘read a nice sonnet to you, which I had sent to me
                        this morning, and which was in my mind just now. These lines’—Mr. Rose here
                        produced a paper from his pocket—‘were written by a boy of eighteen—a youth
                        of extraordinary promise, I think, whose education I may myself claim to
                        have had some share in directing. Listen,’ he said, laying the verses before
                        him, on a clean plate. </p>
                    <quote>

                    <p> ‘Yes,’ murmured Mr. Rose to himself, folding up the paper; ‘they are dear
                        lines. Now, there,’ he said, ‘we have a true and tender expression of the
                        really Catholic spirit of modern æstheticism, which holds nothing common or
                        unclean. It is in this spirit, I say, that the architects of our state will
                        set to work. And thus for our houses, for our picture-galleries, for our
                        churches—I trust we shall have many churches—they will select and combine—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you seriously mean,’ broke in Allen, a little impatiently, ‘that it is a
                        thing to wish for and to look forward to, that we should abandon all
                        attempts at original architecture, and content ourselves with simply
                        sponging on the past?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I do,’ replied Mr. Rose suavely; ‘and for this reason, if for no other,
                        that the world can now successfully do nothing else. Nor, indeed, is it to
                        be expected or even wished that it should.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You say we have no good architecture now!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose; ‘but,
                        Mr. Rose, have you forgotten our modern churches? Don’t you think them
                        beautiful? Perhaps you never go to All Saints’?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I every now and then,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘when I am in the weary mood for it,
                        attend the services of our English Ritualists, and I admire their churches
                        very much indeed. In some places the whole thing is really managed with
                        surprising skill. The dim religious twilight, fragrant with the smoke of
                        incense; the tangled roofs that the music seems to cling to; the tapers, the
                        high altar, and the strange intonation of the priests, all produce a curious
                        old-world effect, and seem to unite one with things that have been long
                        dead. Indeed, it all seems to me far more a part of the past than the
                        services of the Catholics.’ </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose did not express her approbation of the last part of this
                        sentiment, out of regard for Miss Merton; but she gave a smile and a nod of
                        pleased intelligence to Mr. Rose. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ Mr. Rose went on, ‘there is a regretful insincerity about it all,
                        that is very nice, and that at once appeals to me, “<hi>Gleich einer alten
                            halbverklungen Sage</hi>.” The priests are only half in earnest; the
                        congregations, even—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Then I am quite sure,’ interrupted Lady Ambrose with vigour, ‘that you can
                        never have heard Mr. Cope preach.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t know,’ said Mr. Rose languidly. ‘I never enquired, nor have I ever
                        heard anyone so much as mention, the names of any of them. Now all that,
                        Lady Ambrose, were life really in the state it should be, you would be able
                        to keep.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you seriously, and in sober earnest, mean,’ Allen again broke in, ‘that
                        you think it a good thing that all our art and architecture should be
                        borrowed and insincere, and that our very religion should be nothing but a
                        dilettante memory?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The opinion,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘which by the way you slightly misrepresent,
                        is not mine only, but that of all those of our own day who are really
                        devoting themselves to art for its own sake. I will try to explain the
                        reason of this. In the world’s life, just as in the life of a man, there are
                        certain periods of eager and all-absorbing action, and these are followed by
                        periods of memory and reflection. We then look back upon our past, and
                        become for the first time conscious of what we are, and of what we have
                        done. We then see the dignity of toil, and the grand results of it, the
                        beauty and the strength of faith, and the fervent power of patriotism;
                        which, whilst we laboured, and believed, and loved, we were quite blind to.
                        Upon such a reflective period has the world now entered. It has acted and
                        believed already; its task now is to learn to value action and belief—to
                        feel and to be thrilled at the beauty of them. And the chief means by which
                        it can learn this is art—the art of a <hi>renaissance</hi>. For by the power
                        of such art, all that was beautiful, strong, heroic, or tender in the
                        past—all the actions, passions, faiths, aspirations of the world, that lie
                        so many fathom deep in the years—float upwards to the tranquil surface of
                        the present, and make our lives like what seems to me one of the loveliest
                        things in nature, the iridescent film on the face of a stagnant water. Yes;
                        the past is not dead unless we choose that it shall be so. Christianity
                        itself is not dead. There is “nothing of it that doth fade,” but turns “into
                        something rich and strange,” for us to give a new tone to our lives with.
                        And, believe me,’ Mr. Rose went on, gathering earnestness, ‘that the
                        happiness possible in such conscious periods is the only true happiness.
                        Indeed, the active periods of the world were not really happy at all. We
                        only fancy them to have been so by a pathetic fallacy. Is the hero happy
                        during his heroism? No, but after it, when he sees what his heroism was, and
                        reads the glory of it in the eyes of youth or maiden.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘ this is very poor stuff—<hi>very</hi> poor stuff,’ murmured Dr. Jenkinson,
                        whose face had become gradually the very picture of crossness. </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you mean, Mr. Rose,’ said Miss Merton, with a half humorous, half
                        incredulous smile, ‘that we never value religion till we have come to think
                        it nonsense?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Not nonsense—no,’ exclaimed Mr. Rose in gentle horror; ‘I only mean that it
                        never lights our lives so beautifully as when it is leaving them like the
                        evening sun. It is in such periods of the world’s life that art springs into
                        being in its greatest splendour. Your Raphael, Miss Merton, who painted you
                        your “dear Madonnas,” was a luminous cloud in the sunset sky of the
                        Renaissance,—a cloud that took its fire from a faith that was sunk or
                        sinking.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I’m afraid that the faith is not quite sunk yet,’ said Miss Merton, with a
                        slight sudden flush in her cheeks, and with just the faintest touch of
                        suppressed anger. </p>
                    <p> Mr. Saunders, Mr. Stockton, Mr. Storks, and Mr. Luke all raised their
                        eyebrows. </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘such cyclic sunsets are happily apt to linger.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Mr. Rose,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, with her most gracious of smiles, ‘of
                        course everyone who has ears must know that all this is very beautiful, but
                        I am positively so stupid that I haven’t been quite able to follow it all.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I will try to make my meaning clearer,’ he said, in a brisker tone. ‘I
                        often figure to myself an unconscious period and a conscious one, as two
                        women—one an untamed creature with embrowned limbs native to the air and the
                        sea; the other marble-white and swan-soft, couched delicately on cushions
                        before a mirror, and watching her own supple reflection gleaming in the
                        depths of it. On the one is the sunshine and the sea-spray. The wind of
                        Heaven and her unbound hair are playmates. The light of the sky is in her
                        eyes; on her lips is a free laughter. We look at her, and we know that she
                        is happy. <hi>We</hi> know it, mark me; but <hi>she</hi> knows it not. Turn,
                        however, to the other, and all is changed. Outwardly, there is no gladness
                        there. Her dark, gleaming eyes open depth within depth upon us, like the
                        circles of a new Inferno. There is a clear, shadowy pallor on her cheek.
                        Only her lips are scarlet. There is a sadness—a languor, even in the grave
                        tendrils of her heavy hair, and in each changing curve of her bosom as she
                        breathes or sighs.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What a very odd man Mr. Rose is!’ said Lady Ambrose in a loud whisper. ‘He
                        always seems to talk of everybody as if they had no clothes on. And does he
                        mean by this that we ought to be always in the dumps?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ Mr. Rose was meanwhile proceeding, his voice again growing visionary,
                        ‘there is no eagerness, no action there; and yet all eagerness, all action
                        is known to her as the writing on an open scroll; only, as she reads, even
                        in the reading of it, action turns into emotion, and eagerness into a
                        sighing memory. Yet such a woman really may stand symbolically for us as the
                        patroness and the lady of all gladness, who makes us glad in the only way
                        now left us. And not only in the only way, but in the best way—the way of
                        ways. Her secret is self-consciousness. She knows that she is fair; she
                        knows, too, that she is sad; but she sees that sadness is lovely, and so
                        sadness turns to joy. Such a woman may be taken as a symbol, not of our
                        architecture only, but of all the eesthetic surroundings with which we shall
                        shelter and express our life. Such a woman do I see whenever I enter a
                        ritualistic church—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I know,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, ‘that very peculiar people do go to such
                        places; but, Mr. Rose,’ she said with a look of appealing enquiry, ‘I
                        thought they were generally rather over-dressed than otherwise?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The imagination,’ said Mr. Rose, opening his eyes in grave wonder at Mrs.
                        Sinclair, ‘may give her what garb it chooses. Our whole city, then—the city
                        of our new Republic—will be in keeping with this spirit. It will be the
                        architectural and decorative embodiment of the most educated longings of our
                        own times after order and loveliness and delight, whether of the senses or
                        the imagination. It will be, as it were, a resurrection of the past, in
                        response to the longing and the passionate regret of the present. It will be
                        such a resurrection as took place in Italy during its greatest epoch, only
                        with this difference—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You seem to have forgotten trade and business altogether,’ said Dr.
                        Jenkinson. ‘I think, however rich you intend to be, you will find that they
                        are necessary.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes, Mr. Rose, you’re not going to deprive us of all our shops, I hope?’
                        said Lady Ambrose. </p>
                    <p> ‘Because, you know,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, with a soft maliciousness, ‘we
                        can’t go without dresses altogether, Mr. Rose. And if I were there,’ she
                        continued plaintively, ‘I should want a bookseller to publish the scraps of
                        verse—poetry, as I am pleased to call it—that I am always writing.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Pooh!’ said Mr. Rose, a little annoyed, ‘we shall have all that somewhere,
                        of course; but it will be out of the way, in a sort of Piræus, where the
                        necessary καπήλοι—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘A sort of what?’ said Lady Ambrose. </p>
                    <p> ‘Mr. Rose merely means,’ said Donald Gordon, ‘that there must be good
                        folding-doors between the offices and the house of life; and that the
                        servants are not to be seen walking about in the pleasure-grounds.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘exactly so.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, then,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘I quite agree with you, Mr. Rose; and if
                        wishing were only having, I’ve not the least doubt that we should all of us
                        be going back to Mr. Rose’s city to-morrow, instead of to London, with its
                        carts, and cabs, and smoke, and all its thousand-and-one drawbacks. I’m
                        sure,’ she said, turning to Miss Merton, ‘you would, my dear, with all your
                        taste.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It certainly,’ said Miss Merton, smiling, ‘all sounds very beautiful. All I
                        am afraid of is that we should not be quite worthy of it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Nay,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘but the very point is that we shall be worthy of it,
                        and that it will be worthy of us. I said, if you recollect, just now, that
                        the world’s ideal of the future must resemble in many ways its memory of the
                        Italian Renaissance. But don’t let that mislead you. It may resemble that,
                        but it will be something far in advance of it. During the last three hundred
                        years—in fact, during the last sixty or seventy years, the soul of man has
                        developed strangely in its sentiments and its powers of feeling; in its
                        powers, in fact, of enjoying life. As I said, I have a work in the press,
                        devoted entirely to a description of this growth. I have some of the proof
                        sheets with me; and if you will let me I should like to read you one or two
                        passages.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t think much can be made out of that,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, with a
                        vindictive sweetness. ‘Human sentiment dresses itself in different fashions,
                        as human ladies do; but I think beneath the surface it is much the same. I
                        mean,’ he added, suddenly recollecting that he might thus seem to be rooting
                        up the wheat of his own opinions along with the tares of Mr. Rose’s, ‘I mean
                        that I don’t think in seventy years, or even in three hundred, you will be
                        able to show that human nature has <hi>very</hi> much changed. I don’t think
                        so.’ </p>
                    <p> Unfortunately, however, the Doctor found that, instead of putting down Mr.
                        Rose by this, he had only raised up Mr. Luke. </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, Jenkinson, I think you are wrong there,’ said Mr. Luke. ‘As long as we
                        recognise that this growth is at present confined to a very small minority,
                        the fact of such growth is <hi>the</hi> most important, <hi>the</hi> most
                        significant of all facts. Indeed, our friend Mr. Rose is quite right thus
                        far, in the stress he lays on our appreciation of the past, that we have
                        certainly in these modern times acquired a new sense, by which alone the
                        past can be appreciated truly, the sense which, if I may invent a phrase for
                        it, I should call that of Historical Perspective; so that now really for the
                        first time the landscape of history is beginning to have some intelligible
                        charm for us. And this, you know, is not all. Our whole views of
                        things—(you, Jenkinson, must know this as well as I do)—the
                            <hi>Zeitgeist</hi> breathes upon them, and they do not die; but they are
                        changed—they are enlightened.’ </p>
                    <p> The Doctor was too much annoyed to make any audible answer to this; but he
                        murmured with some emphasis to himself, ‘That’s <hi>not</hi> what Mr. Rose
                        was saying; that’s <hi>not</hi> what I was contradicting.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You take, Luke, a rather more rose-coloured view of things than you did
                        last night,’ said Mr. Storks. </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Mr. Luke, with a sigh, ‘far from it. I am not denying (pray,
                        Jenkinson, remember this) that the majority of us are at present either
                        Barbarians or Philistines; and the ugliness of these is more glaring now
                        than at any former time. But that any of us are able to see them thus
                        distinctly in their true colours, itself shows that there must be a deal of
                        light somewhere. Even to make darkness visible some light is needed. We
                        should always recollect that. We are only discontented with ourselves when
                        we are struggling to be better than ourselves.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And in many ways,’ said Laurence, ‘I think the struggle has been
                        successful. Take, for instance, the pleasure we get now from the aspects of
                        external nature, and the way in which these seem to mix themselves with our
                        lives. This certainly is something distinctly modern. And nearly all our
                        other feelings, it seems to me, have changed just like this one, and have
                        become more sensitive, and more highly organised. If we may judge by its
                        expression in literature, love has, certainly; and that I suppose is the
                        most important and comprehensive feeling in life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Does Mr. Laurence only <hi>suppose</hi> that?’ sighed Mrs. Sinclair,
                        casting down her eyes. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, ‘our feelings about these two things—about love
                        and external nature—perhaps have changed somewhat. Yes, I think they have. I
                        think you might make an interesting magazine article out of that—but hardly
                        more.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I rather,’ said Laurence apologetically, ‘agree with Mr. Luke and Mr. Rose,
                        that all our feelings have developed just as these two have. And I think
                        this is partly owing to the fusion in our minds of our sacred and secular
                        ideas—which indeed you were speaking of this morning in your sermon. Thus,
                        to find some rational purpose in life was once merely enjoined as a
                        supernatural duty. In our times it has taken our common nature upon it, and
                        become a natural longing—though, I fear,’ he added softly, ‘a fruitless
                        one.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ suddenly exclaimed Lady Grace, who had been listening intently to her
                        nephew’s words; ‘and if you are speaking of modern progress, Otho, you
                        should not leave out the diffusion of those grand ideas of justice, and
                        right, and freedom, and humanity which are at work in the great heart of the
                        nation. We are growing cultivated in Mr. Luke’s noble sense of the word, and
                        our whole hearts revolt against the way in which women have hitherto been
                        treated, and against the cruelties which dogma asserts the good God can
                        practise, and the cruelties on the poor animals which wicked men do
                        practise. And war too,’ Lady Grace went on, a glow mounting into her soft
                        faded cheek, ‘think how fast we are outgrowing that! England at any rate
                        will never watch the outbreak of another war, with all its inevitable
                        cruelties, without giving at least one sob that shall make all Europe pause
                        and listen. Indeed, we must not forget how the entire substance of religion
                        is ceasing to be a mass of dogmas, and is becoming embodied instead in
                        practice and in action.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Quite true, Lady Grace,’ said Mr. Luke. Lady Grace was just about to have
                        given a sign for rising; but Mr. Luke’s assent detained her. ‘As to war,’ he
                        went on, ‘there may, of course, be different opinions. Questions of policy
                        may arise—’ (‘As if any policy,’ murmured Lady Grace, ‘could justify us in
                        such a thing!’) ‘but religion—yes, that, as I have been trying to teach the
                        world, is the great and important point on which culture is beginning to
                        cast its light—and with just the effect which you describe. It is true that
                        culture is at present but a little leaven hid in a barrel of meal; but still
                        it is doing its work slowly; and in the matter of religion—indeed, in all
                        matters, for religion rightly understood embraces all—’ (‘I <hi>do</hi> like
                        to hear Mr. Luke talk sometimes,’ murmured Lady Grace), ‘its effect is just
                        this—to show us that religion in any civilised, any reasonable, any sweet
                        sense, can never be found except embodied in action; that it is, in fact,
                        nothing but right action, pointed—winged, as it were—by right emotion, by a
                        glow, an aspiration—an aspiration towards God—’ (Lady Grace sighed with
                        feeling) —‘not of course,’ Mr. Luke went on confidentially, ‘that petulant
                        Pedant of the theologians—that irritable angry Father, with the very
                        uncertain temper—but towards—’ ‘An infinite, inscrutable, loving Being,’
                        began Lady Grace, with a slight moisture in her eyes. </p>
                    <p> ‘Quite so,’ said Mr. Luke, not waiting to listen, ‘towards that great
                        Law—that great verifiable tendency of things—that great stream whose flowing
                        such of us as are able are now so anxiously trying to accelerate. There is
                        no vain speculation about creation, and first causes, and consciousness
                        here, which are matters we can never verify, and which matter nothing to
                        us—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ stammered Lady Grace aghast, ‘Mr. Luke, do you mean to say that—but
                        it surely must matter something whether God can hear our prayers, and will
                        help us, and whether we owe Him any duty, and whether He is conscious of
                        what we do, and will judge us—it must matter—’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke leaned forwards towards Lady Grace, and spoke to her in a
                        confidential whisper. </p>
                    <p> ‘Not two straws—not that,’ he said with a smile, and a very slight fillip of
                        his finger and thumb. </p>
                    <p> Lady Grace was thunderstruck. </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ again she stammered softly and eagerly, ‘unless you say there is no
                        personal—’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke hated the word <hi>personal</hi>; it was so much mixed up in his
                        mind with theology, that he even winced if he had to speak of personal talk. </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear Lady Grace,’ he said, in a tone of surprised remonstrance, ‘you are
                        talking like a Bishop.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, certainly,’ said Lady Grace, rising, and struggling, she hardly knew
                        how, into a smile, ‘<hi>nolo episcopari</hi>. You see I do know a little
                        Latin, Mr. Luke.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Luke with a bow, as he pushed back a chair for her, ‘and a
                        bit that has more wisdom in it than all other ecclesiastical Latin put
                        together.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘We’re going to leave you gentlemen to smoke your cigarettes,’ said Lady
                        Grace. ‘We think of going down on the beach for a little, and looking at the
                        sea, which is getting silvery; and by-and-by, I dare say you will not expel
                        us if we come back for a little tea and coffee.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Damn it!’ </p>
                    <p> Scarcely had the last trailing skirt swept glimmering out of the pavilion
                        into the mellow slowly-brightening moonlight, than the gentlemen were
                        astounded by this sudden and terrible exclamation. It was soon found to have
                        issued from Mr. Saunders, who had hardly spoken more than a few sentences
                        during the whole of dinner. </p>
                    <p> ‘What can be the matter? ‘was enquired by several voices. </p>
                    <p> ‘My fool of a servant,’ said Mr. Saunders sullenly, ‘has, I find, in
                        packing, wrapped up a small sponge of mine in my disproof of God’s
                        existence.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘H’f,’ shuddered Mr. Rose, shrinking from Mr. Saunders’s somewhat piercing
                        tones, and resting his forehead on his hand, ‘my head aches sadly. I think I
                        will go down to the sea, and join the ladies.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I,’ said Mr. Saunders, ‘if you will excuse me, must go and see in what
                        state the document is, as I left it drying, hung on the handle of my jug.’ </p>
                    <p> No sooner had Mr. Saunders and Mr. Rose departed than Dr. Jenkinson began to
                        recover his equanimity somewhat. Seeing this, Mr. Storks, who had himself
                        during dinner been first soothed and then ruffled into silence, found
                        suddenly the strings of his tongue loosed. </p>
                    <p> ‘Now, those are the sort of young fellows,’ he said, looking after the
                        retreating form of Mr. Saunders, ‘that really do a good deal to bring all
                        solid knowledge into contempt in the minds of the half-educated. There’s a
                        certain hall in London, not far from the top of Regent Street, where I’m
                        told he gives Sunday lectures.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, sipping his claret, ‘it’s all very bad taste—very
                        bad taste.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And the worst of it is,’ said Mr. Storks, ‘that these young men really get
                        hold of a fact or two, and then push them on to their own coarse and insane
                        conclusions—which have, I admit, to the vulgar eye, the look of being
                        obvious.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, with a seraphic sweetness, ‘we should always
                        suspect everything that seems very obvious. Glaring inconsistencies and
                        glaring consistencies are both sure to vanish if you look closely into
                        them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Now, all that about God, for instance,’ Mr. Storks went on, ‘is utterly
                        uncalled for; and, as young Saunders puts it, is utterly misleading.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, ‘it <hi>all</hi> depends upon the way you say
                        it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I hardly think,’ said Mr. Stockton with a sublime weariness, ‘that we need
                        waste much thought upon <hi>his</hi> way. It is a very common one—that of
                        the puppy that barks at the heels of the master whose meat it steals.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘May I,’ said Mr. Herbert gently, after a moment’s pause, ‘ask this, for I
                        am a little puzzled here. Do I understand that Mr. Saunders’s arguments may
                        be held, on the face of the thing, to disprove the existence of God?’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Storks and Mr. Stockton both stared gravely on Mr. Herbert; and said
                        nothing. Dr. Jenkinson stared at him too; but the Doctor’s eye lit up into a
                        little sharp twinkle of benign content and amusement, and he said— </p>
                    <p> ‘No, Mr. Herbert, I don’t think Mr. Saunders can disprove that, nor anyone
                        else either. For the world has at present no adequate definition of God; and
                        I think we should be able to define a thing before we can satisfactorily
                        disprove it. I think so. I have no doubt Mr. Saunders can disprove the
                        existence of God, as he would define Him. All atheists can do that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ murmured Mr. Stockton, ‘nobly said!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘But that’s not the way,’ the Doctor went on, ‘to set to work—this kind of
                        rude denial. We must be loyal to nature. We must do nothing <hi>per
                            saltum</hi>. We must be patient. We mustn’t leap at Utopias, either
                        religious or irreligious. Let us be content with the knowledge that all
                        dogmas will expand in proportion as we feel they need expansion; for all
                        mere forms are transitory, and even the personality of—’ </p>
                    <p> Fatal word! It was like a match to a cannon. </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah, Jenkinson,’ exclaimed Mr. Luke, and Dr. Jenkinson stopped instantly,
                            ‘<hi>we</hi> see what you mean; and capital sense it is too. But you do
                        yourself as much as anyone else a great injustice, in not seeing that the
                        age is composed of two parts, and that the cultured minority is infinitely
                        in advance of the Philistine majority—which alone is, properly speaking, the
                        present; the minority being really the soul of the future waiting for its
                        body, which at present can exist only as a Utopia. It is the wants of this
                        soul that we have been talking over this afternoon. When the ladies come
                        back to us, there are several things that I should like to say; and then you
                        will see what we mean, Jenkinson—and that even poor Rose has really some
                        right on his side.’ </p>
                    <p> At the mention of Mr. Rose’s name the Doctor’s face again curdled into
                        frost. </p>
                    <p> ‘I don’t think so.’ That was all he said. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p> ‘WE could really, Mr. Luke, almost fancy that we heard the Sirens singing,
                        just now,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, when the ladies of the party had returned
                        from their ramble on the shore, with Mr. Rose amongst them, like Apollo
                        leading the Muses. </p>
                    <p> The coloured lamps were now glowing brightly, with their green and purple
                        clusters; the table was glittering under them, a wilderness of enchanted
                        sparklings; and outside the moonlight was bathing everything, the roof and
                        pillars of the pavilion, the myrtles, and the multitudes of crowding roses,
                        which trembled just a little in the air that they themselves scented. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ Mrs. Sinclair said, whilst there were some arrangements going on
                        amongst the others with shawls and opera-cloaks, ‘I never saw anything like
                        the sea to-night. Far off the spray amongst the rocks looked like mermaids
                        playing; and at our feet it seemed as if the little pale waves were
                        whispering and sighing messages to us. I don’t think I should like to tell
                        quite all I thought they said to me. And listen,’ she cried with a faint
                        sigh, ‘is not that the nightingale? It is—I am certain it is!— <quote><l>
                                              The same that oft-times hath</l><l> Charmed magic
                                casements opening on the foam</l><l> Of perilous seas in faëry lands
                                forlorn.</l></quote> What a night it is, to be sure! We all felt
                        down on the beach as if we were literally breathing in Romance—or—well, I
                        don’t know what the right word is.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And I,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘have been explaining to them, that, had they lived
                        in any other age, they would have felt nothing of all this; that they feel
                        it, by virtue of senses that have only been acquired in ours.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Luke, clearing his throat; ‘that’s quite true, and I want
                        now to try and explain clearly how and why it is true. I was particularly
                        anxious,’ he said in a whisper to Laurence as he drew his chair forward, ‘to
                        speak of this when your Roman Catholic friend was here; as she seems a very
                        intelligent young lady, and is, I have no doubt, fully alive to some of the
                        grotesquenesses of what she considers to be her creed.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke resettled himself. On one side of him was Miss Merton, in a pale
                        blue opera cloak, bordered with white fur, and embroidered with gold,
                        something in her large eyes of a subdued sadness; and on the other side was
                        Mrs. Sinclair, all in white, who looked like a wood-anemone against a
                        background of dark foliage. </p>
                    <p> ‘Now,’ Mr. Luke continued, raising his voice a little, but speaking with a
                        more mellow persuasiveness than usual, ‘we all of us feel, in a general
                        way—I think I may say that we nearly all of us feel—that the cultured
                        minority of the present age is endowed with feelings, sentiments, and powers
                        of insight, not only in advance of its common contemporaries, but in advance
                        of all preceding times. We understand natural beauty, and natural
                        affections, and above all moral beauty, in a new way, all our own. Now, to
                        what is the advance due? It is all due to culture in its highest
                        connection—its connection with religion. We feel stronger emotions about
                        natural scenery, for just the same reason that we feel stronger emotions
                        about righteousness. And the reason is, that our emotions, in either case,
                        no longer tempt us to draw grotesque inferences from themselves. There’s the
                        whole heart of the matter. We rest gratefully content with the objects that
                        excite our love; we don’t pass away beyond them, and forget them. You had an
                        excellent instance of the old treatment I condemn in those verses of
                        Euripides which Mr. Laurence has translated with so much tenderness. There,
                        you see, you have nature—flowers, meadows, and so forth; and more important
                        still, you have a high conception of virtue. But yet in that poem you have
                        no real feeling for either the flowers or the virtue. The feeling only
                        grazes these, so to speak, and glances off to a shadowy deity beyond, who
                        was no more true, no more <hi>verifiable</hi>, than any of the rest of her
                        kind, male or female, singular or triple. And now,’ Mr. Luke went on,
                        turning to Miss Merton, ‘here is another illustration of the whole thing—of
                        the advance made by culture in our entire mental state, of which I
                        particularly wanted to talk to you (for in one point at least we agree, even
                        professedly—the doctrine of development), and this is an illustration of it
                        that you in a special way will appreciate. <hi>You</hi>, of course,’ said
                        Mr. Luke, ‘know something more or less about St. Augustine, I suppose.’ </p>
                    <p> As it was with her reading that Father’s account of <hi>his</hi> conversion
                        that Miss Merton in a peculiar way associated her own, she looked at Mr.
                        Luke with increased interest, feeling at the same time that she had
                        certainly as much knowledge on the subject as he so generously gave her
                        credit for. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ Mr. Luke went on, ‘Augustine was on the whole, you know, the most
                        cultured of all the Fathers, and, considering the early date at which he
                        lived, had in some ways a real insight into Christianity; so we may safely
                        consider him as the most favourable specimen of the results of the old
                        system. Let us take then the purest and most elevating of all the pleasures
                        of life, and enquire, through him, how it is treated and looked upon by
                        theological Christianity. The eyes, says Augustine, love fair and various
                        forms, and shining and lovely colours; and all day long they are before me,
                        and solicit my contemplation. “For” (and this exquisite sentence I remember
                        in his very words) “the Light, that queen of colours, bathing all that we
                        can look upon, from morning till evening, let me go where I will, will still
                        keep gliding by me in unnumbered guises, and soothes me whilst I am busy at
                        other things, and am thinking nothing of her.’”<note n=" 2"><p> Vide

                    </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton was pleased at the appreciative tone in which Mr. Luke quoted.
                        Mr. Luke noticed this, and he was pleased also. </p>
                    <p> ‘And now,’ he continued, ‘what return does our gentleman make to the light
                        for its beautiful and constant service to him? Does he thank it? does he
                        praise it? does he seek it? No—’ Mr. Luke here gave a little laugh—‘not a
                        bit of it! He prays to his God that he may be delivered from its insidious
                        snares; he envies the blindness of Tobit, and describes himself as
                        “earnestly groaning” under the temptations of these eyes of his flesh. That
                        is all! There,’ said Mr. Luke, with a confident appeal to Miss Merton, whose
                        expression was now slightly altering, ‘we have in a most pointed form the
                        barbarising results of the old theological religion. And now, put side by
                        side with this, the following expression of the religion of sweet reason,
                        such as culture reveals it to us. It deals with exactly the same sense, and
                        the same pleasures:— <quote><l> What soul was his, when, from the naked
                                top</l><l> Of some bold headland, he beheld the sun</l><l> Rise up,
                                and bathe the world in light! He looked—</l><l> Ocean and earth, the
                                solid frame of earth</l><l> And ocean’s liquid mass beneath him
                                lay</l><l> In gladness and deep joy. The clouds were touched,</l><l>
                                And in their silent faces could be read</l><l> Unutterable love.
                                Sound needed none,</l><l> Nor any voice of joy; his spirit
                                drank</l><l> The spectacle: sensation, soul, and form,</l><l> All
                                melted into him; they swallowed up</l><l> His animal being; in them
                                did he live,</l><l> And by them did he live; they were his
                                life.</l><l> In such access of mind, in such high hour</l><l> Of
                                visitation from the living God,</l><l> Thought was not; in enjoyment
                                it expired;</l><l> No thanks he breathed, he proffered no
                                request.’</l></quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> A sudden sigh here escaped from some one. Mr. Luke looked round. </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ exclaimed Mr. Stockton, ‘what a description of prayer! What a noble,
                        what a magnificent description!’ </p>
                    <p> The fashion of Mr. Luke’s countenance changed. He stopped short, he would
                        not proceed a word farther. His whole quotation had been ruined, he felt, by
                        this odious interruption. </p>
                    <p> ‘I never supposed,’ said Miss Merton, who thought Mr. Luke pausing that she
                        might give in her acquiescence, ‘I never supposed St. Augustine’s views
                        quite final upon all matters. I dare say there are some things that even I
                        could have taught him.’ </p>
                    <p> She smiled as she said this; but there was a little embarrassment in her
                        tone which was perceived by Laurence, and which brought him at once to her
                        rescue. </p>
                    <p> ‘I,’ he said, ‘think the contrast Mr. Luke has drawn even stronger than he
                        has made it. I by no means think that Augustine was afraid of the pleasures
                        of light and sight as they were enjoyed by Wordsworth; for I can hardly
                        fancy that he could have had the least conception of them. They seem to me a
                        new and peculiar heritage, which <hi>we</hi> may all more or less have part
                        in; but which by former ages were undreamt of, not rejected. I often myself
                        look back on a certain early walk I took one spring morning in these
                        gardens—amongst the very trees and flowerbeds we are now looking out upon.
                        The fresh softness that was in the air, and all the wandering scents, like
                        dreams or prophecies of summers gone or coming, and the wet light glistening
                        on the dewy leaves, seemed to go at once to the soul—to “melt into me,” as
                        into Wordsworth’s herdsman. Once I surprised myself stooping under a
                        dripping bough, to look upwards at a yellow flower, and watch it lonely
                        against a background of blue sky; and once I started to find myself quite
                        lost in staring at a red rock, gleaming amongst shrubs and ivy, which a
                        plant of periwinkle spangled with a constellation of purple stars. The
                        colour, the shape, the smell of every leaf and flower—each seemed to touch
                        me like a note of music; and the bloom of morning mist was over everything.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Mrs. Sinclair, her dark eyes gleaming in the moonlight, ‘how
                        those spring mornings sometimes make one sick with longing!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Laurence, ‘with longing—with a vague longing; not always, I am
                        afraid, with thanksgiving or with praise. But I think the feeling in all its
                        moods is the same in some ways. It is a mixing together of outward and
                        inward things—our whole inward lives passing out of us into Nature; Nature
                        melting into us, and growing part of our inward lives, so that all our hopes
                        and fears and memories become embodied things, touching us in scents of
                        flowers, in the breath of the air, in the sparkle of water, or mixing, like
                        Hamadryads, their beings with the trees. Now, could I have described such
                        feelings as these—my own state of mind during my morning walk—to Saint
                        Augustine, he would not have understood me. He would have thought me raving.
                        And my case is not peculiar. These feelings are no private things of my own.
                        They belong to our whole age. And of this,’ Laurence went on, ‘you may see a
                        very curious proof in a part of our modern literature, which as literature
                        is least successful. I mean, a certain class of novels: not the works of the
                        greater novelists, still less the works of the professional
                        novel-manufacturers; not these, but a sort of production almost peculiar to
                        our own time—the novels of amateurs, who write perhaps but a single book
                        during their whole lives; and that one, with the simple aim of pouring out
                        their own feelings for themselves to contemplate, or of explaining to
                        themselves or others their own histories.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And so,’ said Mr. Storks, ‘you would gauge the refinement of the age by its
                        silliest novels?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I think we too often forget,’ said Laurence, ‘that a very silly book may be
                        evidently the work of a very clever person; and may show its author
                        possessed of every gift, except that of literature. And in many of the poor
                        novels I am speaking of, the utter failure of the expression often only
                        calls our attention more strongly to the depth, the delicacy, and the
                        refinement of what the writer has struggled to express. I was reading a
                        girl’s novel in the train the other day, called <hi>Love in a Life</hi>. Its
                        long spasms of ungrammatical verbiage, its utter want of knowledge of the
                        world, would have turned the dullest reviewer, in spite of himself, into a
                        caustic wit. But there was a something all through it, that its authoress
                        was trying—trying to utter, that reminded me of Ariel trying to escape from
                        his tree. What, Lady Ambrose! Have <hi>you</hi> written a novel? No? Then
                        why are you looking so mysterious, and so full of meaning?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Go on, Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘I’ll show you by-and-by.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘take any one of these novels, and you will find the
                        writer looking on Nature in just that peculiar modern way that we have been
                        talking of. I don’t say you will always find the sentiment in the books, but
                        the books will show you that you would find it in the writers. And this
                        feeling about Nature is but an example of others. Take, as I said, the
                        modern conception of love, and study that too, in these foolish novels. You
                        will find half the folly comes from an attempt to express much, not from
                        success in expressing little.’ </p>
                    <p> A pause followed this. It was broken at last by Allen. </p>
                    <p> ‘I quite agree with Mr. Laurence,’ he said diffidently. ‘I have not much
                        right to judge, I dare say. I am not a great reader; and I can only speak
                        from books. But still I know a little of the love poetry of this and of
                        other times; and the poetry of this has always seemed to me far—far the
                        highest. It has seemed to me to give the passion so much more meaning, and
                        such a much greater influence over all life. And this, I suppose, must be
                        because men, as the world goes on, are really learning to love in a higher
                        way than perhaps they themselves are often conscious of.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I think some philosopher,’ murmured Mrs. Sinclair to Leslie, ‘says we feel
                        that we are greater than we know. It must be a great comfort sometimes to
                        know that we are greater than we feel.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Is it not Novalis,’ went on Allen, ‘who says that if all the human race
                        were a single pair of lovers, the difference between mysticism and
                        non-mysticism would cease? Would that have been understood even a hundred
                        years ago? But as to poets, I was thinking of two English poets of our own
                        day especially. Shakespeare may of course have exhibited the working of love
                        more powerfully than they; yet I am sure he could never have conceived its
                        meaning and its nature so deeply. No heroine of his could have understood
                        Mrs. Browning’s <hi>Sonnets from the Portuguese</hi>; nor any hero of his
                        her husband’s love lyrics. What seems to me the thing so peculiarly modern,
                        is this notion of love as something which, once truly attained, would, as
                        Browning says, <quote><l>                   make Time break,</l><l> Letting
                                us pent-up creatures through</l><l> Into Eternity, our
                            due.’</l></quote>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah!’ murmured Mrs. Sinclair, ‘but suppose there is no eternity! I think we
                        had better take what we can, and be thankful. Listen—listen again! “The
                        nightingales, the nightingales!” There, Lord Allen, there is a bit of your
                        Mrs. Browning for you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What, Lord Allen!’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘and is Mr. Robert Browning a better
                        poet than Shakespeare? I always thought Shakespeare was <hi>quite</hi> our
                        best.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It is not a question,’ said Laurence, as Allen did not speak, ‘of different
                        poets, but of different ages. I have often wondered myself how far
                            <hi>Faust</hi> would have appealed to the author of <hi>Hamlet</hi>, and
                        whether all the spiritual action of the drama, in so far as it relates to
                        the heroine, might not be lost upon him. What a difference between Margaret
                        and Ophelia—not between themselves, but between the parts they play!
                        Shakespeare himself <hi>might</hi> have understood Margaret’s influence. I
                        doubt it. But even if he had, that would prove little. Shakespeare’s was
                                <quote><l>                    The prophetic soul</l><l> Of the wide
                                world dreaming on things to come;</l></quote> and the “wide world”
                        of his time would itself have understood nothing of it. But what strikes me
                        still more than the growth of particular feelings, is the infusion and the
                        inter-penetration of all. Look at Shakespeare’s Sonnets. He loved the
                        objects they were addressed to; he loved flowers and Nature. But these two
                        sets of things were <hi>connected</hi> only in his mind, they were not
                            <hi>fused</hi>. Take, however, that most typical of all modern poems—the
                        celebrated love-song in <hi>Maud</hi>, and think of that:— <quote><l> The
                                slender acacia would not shake</l><l>   One long milk-bloom on the
                                tree;</l><l> The white lake-blossom fell into the lake.</l><l>   And
                                the pimpernel dozed on the lea;</l><l> But the rose was awake all
                                night for your sake,</l><l>   Knowing your promise to me;</l><l> The
                                lilies and roses were all awake,</l></quote> What a passion is here!
                        We almost hear the lover’s pulses as they painfully beat quicker. Our breath
                        catches with his; and we long and long with his longing. And yet hardly a
                        word about his feelings is said directly. The secret is echoed back to us
                        from the scene and from the summer night. It is the milk-bloom of the
                        acacia, the musk of the roses, the stir of the morning breeze, that tells it
                        all to us as if they were living things, and as if a human passion had
                        passed into them for a soul. Now, would the world have understood this in
                        any other times but ours? I don’t think even Shakespeare’s Jessica would,
                        nor Dante’s Beatrice, nor Petrarch’s Laura, nor Horace’s Lydia, nor Plato’s
                        Diotima, nor Homer’s Helen.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Listen!’ exclaimed Mr. Rose eagerly, as soon as Laurence stopped; ‘will you
                        let me read one passage out of my work which bears upon this very point—in
                        fact, sums up exactly what you have been saying? It occurs,’ said Mr. Rose,
                        who was sitting ready under one of the lamps with some printer’s proofs
                        before him, ‘in my <hi>Essay on Capacity</hi>. “<hi>But chief</hi>”—this is
                        the passage I mean—“<hi>But chief amongst the new things which the heart of
                            man has come to the understanding of , is the passion of love, in its
                            distinctly modern form. The goddess of this love is no longer the
                            Aphrodite of the Greeks, or the Mary of the Christians, She is a
                            mysterious hybrid being, in whose veins is the blood of both of them.
                            She is Mary in her desire of the Creator; she is Aphrodite in her desire
                            of the creature; and in her desire of the creation, she is also
                            Artemis.</hi>” (‘Oh, this will <hi>never</hi> do—this will
                            <hi>never</hi> do!’ muttered Dr. Jenkinson to himself, tapping with his
                        feet on the ground.) ‘“<hi>Into the strange passion,</hi>”’ Mr. Rose went
                        on, ‘“<hi>of which hers is the tutelage, there have melted the sounds of
                            woods and of waters, and the shapes and the hues of mountains, and the
                            savour of airs and winds, and the odours of all flowers. All the joys,
                            indeed, of the senses have fallen into it, like streams into one sea.
                            And with the joys of the spirit it has been likewise. But whereas the
                            senses have contributed their joys mainly, the spirit has contributed
                            its sorrows and pains as well. Throughout this love, despite its fulness
                            of life, there yet runs also a constant taint of death, of which it
                            needs cleansing—grotesque troubles and misgivings of conscience, and
                            cloistral meditations, and fantastic repentances. For this very reason,
                            however, is it the more wholly expressive to us of the man’s inner
                            development. It shows us how all his desires, senses, and powers of
                            feeling have been growing together, and coalescing into a single
                            organism, capable of quite new sets of pleasures, and responding to far
                            finer movements from without.</hi>”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘H’m,’ said Mr. Luke slowly, in a tone of meditative commendation, ‘there’s
                        a great deal of truth in that—a very great deal—if the fellow,’ he added to
                        himself, ‘would only put it a little better.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Are you <hi>quite</hi> sure,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, looking round him in an
                        agony of suppressed irritation, ‘that anyone at all feels all these things,
                        beyond the very few people who talk about them?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Rose, smiling with a honeyed gravity, and wholly unconscious
                        of the Doctor’s animus, ‘all feel thus who have any part or lot in the
                        world’s development.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You,’ said the Doctor, turning sharply away from Mr. Rose, ‘think so,
                        Laurence, don’t you, because you find some of the same sort of phrases in
                        novels? I don’t think you’ll find very much thought in those novels—not very
                        much. They are effeminate foolish books.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Allen with an assenting voice that much pleased the Doctor, ‘a
                        great deal of this increased depth and refinement of feeling, I know, is
                        very good—all of it, I dare say, may be. But still, if left to itself, it
                        must tend—indeed, I have often seen it tend—to make men effeminate, as Dr.
                        Jenkinson says, and unfit for work. Now, I dare say Mr. Luke will call me a
                        barbarian, but I am going to venture to say that, in spite of all that is
                        said against it, that barbarous thing sport—shooting, deer-stalking,
                        hunting—is of great value, especially to people who are not barbarians, as a
                        kind of mental tonic. It makes them active and spirited—it must do so: it
                        gives them presence of mind, and a readiness to exert themselves; and though
                        sport may in one sense be a self-indulgence, it is a self-indulgence that is
                        constantly teaching all sorts of self-denial.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear Lord Allen,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘I most entirely agree with you. It
                        does seem, I admit, at first sight, a somewhat singular thing, that the
                        result of the latest civilisation should be to give men leisure to return to
                        the occupations of their earliest barbarism—and those too deprived of their
                        one justification—necessity. But still these barbarous sports must, as you
                        say, if not pursued too exclusively, give a valuable moral tone to minds
                        whose refinement might else become weakness. Only the worst of the matter,
                        as it actually stands, is this—that the majority of people who do follow
                        sport, are the very people who have no refinement that needs strengthening,
                        but merely an idle aimless strength that needs refining. And you must
                        remember, Lord Allen, that the man who is gluttonous of aimless bodily
                        action is no better than the man who is an epicure in aimless mental
                        emotion.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And so,’ said Donald Gordon, with devout solemnity, ‘this is what we must
                        remedy in our new Republic. Our gentlemen there must have both sides of
                        their nature developed equally; and they must be at once so intellectual and
                        so manly, as to be content that partridges and foxes shall die exclusively
                        for them, without their living exclusively for partridges and foxes.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Exactly so,’ said Mr. Luke drily. </p>
                    <p> ‘Some one observed this afternoon,’ said Allen, turning a little stiffly to
                        Donald Gordon, ‘how one could see the expression of a girl’s face changed by
                        the influence of a little genuine mental culture. I have noticed the same
                        thing in men’s faces, under the influence of a little genuine bodily
                        culture. And I think myself that the moors of your country, or a river in
                        Norway, or a good cruise in a yacht, may go—well, at least half as far
                        towards making a complete man, as the study of books, and art, and poetry,
                        in an arm-chair, or in a picture-gallery.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I think that is so true,’ said Miss Merton softly to him in a whisper, for
                        Dr. Jenkinson had begun to speak. </p>
                    <p> ‘But,’ the Doctor was saying, ‘you must want something besides looking at
                        pretty scenery, and falling in love, and shooting. I think you want
                        something besides that to make life complete. You will want to exercise your
                        intellect—your reason.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Allen, ‘and I defend all this voluntary physical exercise and
                        excitement, because I think it makes the mind even more healthy than it does
                        the body.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Dr. Jenkinson with a smile, ‘I think that’s right.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You, gentlemen,’ interposed Lady Grace, ‘seem to be taking very good care
                        of yourselves; but are we women to shoot and take all this exercise also?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘That,’ said Mr. Luke with a courtly smile, ‘we defer to your superior
                        wisdom. There are, however, two helps to education, akin to exercise, in
                        which both sexes will share, and which in a perfect state of society would
                        be most important in their results. I mean travelling, and the halving of
                        our lives between town and country. The completeness, the many-sidedness of
                        such culture as there is amongst us, is in a great measure due to these; but
                        it is only slowly that we are learning to use them properly. Of course,
                        Jenkinson, you understand all this—no man can do so better. It is simply the
                        music and gymnastic of the Greeks. It is simply true education, which is but
                        another name for culture. And in the cultivated man, thought, and taste, and
                        feeling, and spirit are really all one, and fused together. Could we but
                        look forward to a time when all or even the greater part of those one meets
                        would unite these priceless gifts, there might then indeed be some
                        satisfaction and some hope in life.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And don’t you want goodness?’ said Dr. Jenkinson, all his sharpness
                        returning; ‘do you want no sense of duty, and right, and wrong?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Laurence, ‘but we have included that already. We have found that
                        that is pre-supposed in every educated pleasure. It is that that gives even
                        our lightest conversation its best sparkle, and beads its surface over with
                        its bright, crisp foam of half-conscious irony. The moral ideal is a note,
                        as it were, which we are always hearing, and with which our daily talk makes
                        continual harmonies, because it is never pitched in unison with it. Thus we
                        talk of killing time, and so on, as being the great end of our lives; of
                        money or position being the only thing to marry for; and of marriage ties as
                        if they were always a weariness, or a grotesque torture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And thus,’ said Leslie, ‘we say a man has had, <hi>par excellence</hi>, a
                        success, when he has, for his own selfish pleasure, done a woman the
                        greatest injury possible.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And thus,’ said Donald Gordon softly, ‘when he does not tell all the world
                        he has done so, we say he is a perfect gentleman.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And do you want no religion?’ said Dr. Jenkinson, paying no attention to
                        all this, but again turning to Mr. Luke. </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear Jenkinson,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘you and I agree upon these matters so
                        well, that I think you must be trying to misunderstand us. Can religion and
                        morals be separated? and are not they both included in what we mean by
                        culture? Is it not in virtue of culture—of that nice and complex
                        discrimination—that we can tell at once when we come across a genuine
                            <hi>logion</hi> of Jesus amongst the sayings vulgarly supposed to be
                        most distinctive of Him? Think, for instance,’ Mr. Luke continued, ‘what a
                        beautiful and profound harmony is at once made amongst our heartstrings, if
                        culture have really tuned them, by such a story as that of the woman taken
                        in adultery, or by the parable of the Prodigal Son, or by such simple,
                        pregnant sayings as, “ὑπάγω καὶ ἔρχομαι πρὸς” and then turn for a moment to
                        the theological accounts of the Trinity! Why,’ exclaimed Mr. Luke with a
                        sudden jauntiness, ‘to sit on the key-board of an organ would make music
                        compared to the discord, the jangling, the string-breaking that Church
                        Catechisms, and Athanasian Creeds, and Episcopal speculations on the
                        personality of the Creator, make on the musical instrument of the cultured
                        mind. Ah,’ Mr. Luke continued, ‘could the Founder of Christianity only have
                        found men of more culture as His immediate disciples and reporters—could He
                        only have secured a biographer as simply honest as poor Boswell was—Well,
                        well, but it’s no use speculating about what might have been. Religion has
                        had bad times hitherto, but now at last we—some of us, at least—are seeing
                        the way to make them better; you yourself, Jenkinson, amongst the number.
                        And all this is due to that very thing which we say is the essence of the
                        best human life—culture; culture which is neither religion, nor morality,
                        nor taste, nor intellect, nor knowledge, nor wide reading, but the single
                        result of all—and this,’ Mr. Luke added, ‘showing itself to the full—doing
                        itself complete justice, through—as our friends have already said— what we
                        call polish and high-breeding, and refinement of manner, and of manners.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Surely you,’ said Mr. Stockton, turning to Dr. Jenkinson with the most
                        mollifying deference, ‘must agree with us that the present century has seen
                        the soul of man widening out, with all its marvellous powers, and displaying
                        new riches of beauty like an unfolding flower. But whilst we value—and none
                        can value more than I—our higher flights of imagination, our finer forms of
                        love, and poetry, and worship, I am not blind to the great agent that is at
                        the bottom of all this change. I mean the emancipated human intellect, with
                        all its manifold apparatus of discovery and conquest—that great liberator of
                        life, and thought, and religion.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘There is some truth in that,’ said Dr. Jenkinson, not ungraciously, ‘but I
                        think you are all putting it in a wrong way. And, Luke,’ he added with a
                        little more causticity, ‘to understand Christianity, you must know something
                        of other religions too. You must study the great religions of the East, and
                        compare them with those of the West. No religion can be understood by its
                        own light only.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘In our ideal city,’ said Mr. Rose, ‘as I saw it in my brief Apocalypse, you
                        will find a home and a temple for every creed, and for every form of
                        worship.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘What!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, ‘does Dr. Jenkinson want us to introduce
                        Juggernaut and his car into England?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘May I ask you one question,’ broke in Mr. Herbert suddenly, ‘a question
                        which at times, I confess, seems to me not without importance! Will this
                        religion of yours, as you told us in the afternoon it was based on the
                        discrimination between good and evil, also involve a discrimination between
                        life and death? Will it, I mean, point to any other life beyond this, or
                        will it not? Is whatever evil and sorrow we patiently suffer, a thing which,
                        if it do not bring its reward to us here, will never bring us any reward at
                        all? And shall we call the death of the noble sufferer blessed for no other
                        reason than that he rests from his labours and his works do not follow him?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Dear me! dear me!’ said Dr. Jenkinson petulantly to himself. ‘These sort of
                        questions ought never to be asked in that hard abrupt way. You can’t answer
                        them—you can’t answer them.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Stockton, however, found no difficulty with <hi>his</hi> answer. </p>
                    <p> ‘As to that,’ he said, ‘each man would think as he pleased, and his thoughts
                        would shape themselves to meet the deepest needs of his life. In the state
                        of society we long for, the belief in a future life would be open to all to
                        accept or to reject. The only thing to guard against would be any definite
                        public opinion on the matter, one way or the other; for in any definite
                        public opinion, remember, there is the germ of all dogmatism and of all
                        persecution. Public opinion, in society as it ought to be, would be a
                        frictionless fluid, if I may borrow a metaphor from science, in which no
                        adventitious obstacle from prejudice or otherwise would impede the progress
                        of any view that its own merits set in motion.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Luke was certainly an unfortunate man. Mr. Stockton had again, in part
                        at least, expressed the exact thing which in other words he was going to
                        have said himself. Mr. Luke, however, did not flinch. He boldly took the
                        bull by the horns. </p>
                    <p> ‘True,’ he said; ‘that metaphor is ingenious, and explains exactly what we
                        want to explain. That <hi>is</hi> one of the great conditions of a truly
                        cultivated society, what Mr. Stockton calls a frictionless public opinion—a
                        public opinion which shall let every system, every creed, every philosophy
                        of life, stand or fall on its own practical verifiable merits; and this we
                        shall get, too, if we can only banish two things, prejudice and ignorance,
                        of which last,’ Mr. Luke added, looking studiously away from Mr. Stockton,
                        ‘by far the deadliest form is the fetish-worship of useless knowledge.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Miss Merton, ‘I suppose that this is all that any of us would
                        ask, who really and truly believe in what we profess to believe.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course it is,’ said Mr. Luke, ‘everything:—everything.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And I’m <hi>quite</hi> sure,’ said Lady Grace, ‘that in a society where the
                        tone is so nobly liberal, and where all have such a true and burning
                        admiration of the morally beautiful, it will be quite impossible that
                        woman’s life shall not be seen to be what it really is—a thing as capable as
                        men’s of high aims, and independent purposes, and not, as it were, entirely
                        sunk in theirs. I, Mr. Luke, in face of such a public opinion as you speak
                        of, should have little fear for our cause. I think, under God, it would
                        prosper there.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course it would,’ said Mr. Luke. ‘If culture enables us to detect beauty
                        and to prize it, what should it enable us to prize more than womanhood, with
                        all its exquisite capabilities developed to their utmost? Life has no
                        greater ornament than cultured womanhood.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Except cultured manhood,’ said Lady Grace, unconsciously giving Mr. Luke a
                        slight wound by her generous and unexpected return of his royal compliment.
                        ‘Ah,’ she sighed to herself with a look at Mr. Luke, ‘and he does not
                        believe in God—or thinks he does not! I suppose it must needs be that
                        offences come; but I wish they did not come by such good men. However—I
                        trust that it is all really for the best. And then—there is no such thing as
                        eternal punishment. One may be thankful to feel sure of that.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I am afraid you will think me very troublesome,’ said Mr. Herbert, who had
                        been talking to Laurence in a low tone for the last few minutes. ‘but there
                        is one question more I should like to ask you. I want to know if you, who
                        see the many delicate beauties of life, and the countless positions it may
                        be viewed from,—I want to know if you will teach the lower, the commoner
                        classes, who look up to you as models, to quote poetry, and to be enquiring
                        and sceptical also?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I hope not, indeed,’ broke in Lady Ambrose with vigour; ‘and as to our
                        being their models, Mr. Herbert, I’m sure you can’t mean that. It seems to
                        me one of the very worst things in these times that they will take us for
                        their models. However, I think it is really a good deal our fault, and that
                        it comes very much from our giving our maids so many of our old clothes to
                        wear. That sort of thing puts notions into their heads. Now, here at any
                        rate is <hi>one</hi> reform, that is implied in our Republic;—I don’t like
                        that word <hi>Republic</hi>, by the way—we must put a stop to all this
                        imitation of ourselves. Isn’t that so, Mr. Laurence? ’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Thank you, Lady Ambrose,’ said Mr. Herbert, rising, ‘thank you. I think it
                        altogether a wise—nay, more than wise, an essential thing, to keep these
                        wide speculations from spreading beyond the only circles that they are
                        really fitted for. I have to go indoors now, as I have a few matters to
                        arrange to-night; but I am much obliged to you all for what you have taught
                        me about culture, and enlightenment, and society, as it ought to be.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘The difficulty is,’ said Lady Ambrose, as Mr. Herbert was walking away,
                        ‘how to keep all this thought, and so forth, to ourselves. One thing I’m
                        quite certain of, that we really do a great deal of harm without thinking of
                        it, by the way in which we speak our minds out before servants, and that
                        sort of people, without in the least considering what may come of it. Now,
                        what do you think of this, as a plan for making our ideal state a really
                        good and contented place?—the upper classes should speak a different
                        language from the lower classes. Of course we should be able to speak
                        theirs, but they would not be able to speak ours. And then, you see, they
                        would never hear us talk, or read our books, or get hold of our ideas;
                        which, after all, is what does all the mischief. And yet,’ said Lady Ambrose
                        with a sigh, ‘that’s not the great difficulty. The great difficulty would be
                        about daughters and younger sons, and how to give them all enough to keep
                        them going in the world. However, this we can talk of in a minute. But—’
                        here Lady Ambrose put her hand in her pocket, and a sound was heard as of
                        rustling paper. </p>
                    <p> ‘I really do believe,’ said Laurence, ‘that Lady Ambrose <hi>has</hi>
                        written a novel, although she denies it; and there she is going to read a
                        bit of it now, as a specimen of her own culture.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘No,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘really and truly. And if I had written a novel,
                        Mr. Laurence, I should not have the cruelty to inflict it upon you. No; but
                        what I have here,’ she said at last, producing a manuscript, ‘though it is
                        not mine, is next door to a novel, and in some respects better than one. It
                        is a sort of memoir of herself, written by a certain lady I know. I am
                        betraying no confidence in showing it to you; as she herself has lent it to
                        a good many friends, and as long as her name is not mentioned, she is by way
                        of wishing to have it circulated. She has, in fact, consulted me about
                        having it printed. Now I want you, Mr. Laurence, to look through some of it,
                        and tell me if the writer is not really a person of culture. Perhaps you
                        would not mind reading out a little of it.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Am I to read it all through?’ asked Laurence, as he took the seat which Mr.
                        Rose gave up to him at the table. </p>
                    <p> ‘No, no,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘Just pick out the best bits—a page here, and a
                        page there.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘I will, at any rate, start with the beginning. Now,
                        are all of us ready to be let into the secrets of a young lady’s soul?— </p>
                    <p> ‘“<hi>One often feels a longing—who has not felt it?—in the hurry and
                            trouble of life to pause for a little while and look back upon the past,
                            which we too too often forget, and see what it is we have grown from. We
                            long to see how it has fared with ourselves—our own selves—our
                            characters.</hi>”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I think you may skip the beginning,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘it’s a little
                        dull. Turn over a page or two.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘“<hi>How strangely do they come back to me, those distant irrevocable
                            days!</hi>” Will that do?’ asked Laurence. </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘I think so— go on there.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘“<hi>—those distant irrevocable days, when the world was all new to me, and
                            each experience was fresh and delightful, and I knew nothing of what
                            self-reproach could mean. Ah, me! how times have changed since then! I
                            sometimes fancy that I am hardly worthy now to look back upon my own
                            past. I was gifted naturally with a curious warmth and sincerity of
                            nature, that must have been very beautiful. But my peculiar gift, my own
                            own gift, was a power of sympathy with others, by which quite naturally
                            I used to throw myself into their places, understand their difficulties,
                            and excite myself with their interests. When I was yet quite a child,
                            that, I know, is what men felt in me—I never cared for boys—one man
                            especially. It was then that life began for me, and what it all meant
                            broke on me like a revelation. I, in my simplicity, never dreamt of his
                            being more than a friend—I am not sure even that he was my dearest
                            friend. I certainly never tried to charm him. But I did charm him,
                            nevertheless, quite unconsciously. And he loved me passionately,
                            devotedly, child as I was. Ah, God! when will another ever feel the same
                            for me? And I—‘O, my lost, my rejected friend! come back to me’,
                            sometimes I still cry in my solitude; ‘poor, and obscurely connected as
                            you are, come back to me!’ I shall never forget—poor little me!—the
                            solemn shock of the moment, how my heart stood still, how all the blood
                            came rushing into my cheek, when all of a sudden, as it seemed to me,
                            and without any warning, he asked me to be his wife. Everything seemed
                            to grow dizzy before me. It seemed to me as if the day of judgment had
                            come. (Alas! will there ever be a day of judgment at all? is what I now
                            ask.) I don’t know what I said. I only remember distinctly my throwing
                            myself into my mother’s arms, and crying like a child—and I was one—as
                            if my very heart would break. ‘I am only a child!’ that is what I said.
                            ‘Oh, mother, I am such a child!’ The pathos of the scene often comes
                            back to me even now—a shadowy timid memory, wondering if I shall give it
                            harbour. I remember, too, how I said my prayers that night, and how I
                            asked God—</hi>”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I think you needn’t read that,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘go on a page or two
                        further.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘“<hi>I spent much of my time sketching.</hi>” Shall I go on there?’ said
                        Laurence. ‘“<hi>I had always a curiously appreciative eye for natural
                            beauty.</hi>” Will that do? Or shall I go on here—I think this is
                        better—at the next paragraph?—“<hi>Oh the great waste of love in this our
                            world.</hi>”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes, go on there,’ said Mrs. Sinclair and several others. </p>
                    <p> ‘“<hi>Oh the great waste of love in this our world! How many a true heart
                            would have given itself to me, could I only honestly and unreservedly
                            have opened out to it all the depths of mine, and received it! And why
                            did I never do so? It may be that I have known none who could really
                            understand me—none that I could really love. But does that excuse me,
                            not for not loving them, but for making as though I did love them, and
                            so ruining their lives and searing my own? sending them in the end to
                            their brandy-bottles, and their gaming-hells, and their wild Cremornes,
                            and myself—to the mental state in which I am now! </hi></p>
                    <p>
                        <hi>‘“Have I then lost it for ever—lost all hope of love? and must I quietly
                            take up with my unappreciated loneliness? If it is so, if, indeed, it is
                            so, surely I have brought it on myself. Was there not one—not my
                            earliest lover—but another, who with a devotion I understood far more
                            fully, laid himself at my feet, and offered me all his man’s devotion,
                            and his man’s sympathy! Why, why in my madness did I send him from me,
                            penniless as he was—but what of that?—driving him to death, and leaving
                            myself to desolation? How does the image of his pale still face upturned
                            towards the Indian star-light, with eyes which no star-light could ever
                            touch any more, rise before me—his hand on his breast, and clasping with
                            its last grasp a locket with my picture in it! Yes, I see him there,
                            though I did not see him. I know how he must have looked, with his heart
                            bullet-pierced—noble, beautiful in death. Unworthy as I was of you, my
                            true-hearted one, too late, too late, did I learn my own unworthiness. I
                            was sitting in the window of our house at Ventnor, when the letter came
                            that told me. It was evening; and I had been looking out through the
                            summer twilight at the sea and at the sunset. As I read the letter, it
                            dropped from my hand. I gave a gasp. I repressed a shrill cry. I felt a
                            choking sensation in my throat; but I was very proud, and I even
                            repressed a sob. I only, with entire calmness, turned my head towards
                            the sea, and sighed a sigh deep-drawn as if my soul were in it. My cheek
                            was pale, my eyes were wild and wistful—full of a solemn new
                            earnestness. What the exact thoughts were that were busy in me, I cannot
                            tell. All I am conscious of was this, that far, far off were the great
                            crimson spaces of evening sky and a trail of rippled splendour on the
                            sea. One great violet cloud fringed with a border of living fire, that
                            seemed to be eating into it, hung just above the place where the sun had
                            gone down; and over this, in a pale liquid solitude of hushed colour,
                            was the evening star, trembling like a tear-drop. I was always sensitive
                            to colour; and somehow or other this sunset relieved me—went right to my
                            heart with a quiet sense of healing. That evening was, I think, one of
                            the great points in my life. I seemed ever after to see my own character
                            more clearly—how deep were my own capacities for feeling, and also how
                            strangely Nature could enter in and comfort me, when all human sympathy
                            would have seemed intrusive. That night, when I went upstairs, I hardly
                            knew myself. There was a wild look in my eyes—an inexpressible
                            mournfulness and an inexpressible longing. Two or three long tendrils of
                            hair had got loose, and hung over my forehead with a kind of wild
                            languor. ‘What is there that men can see in me to attract them?’ I had
                            often said to myself. I think then a something of what it was began to
                            dawn upon me. ‘And he—he, the true, the gallant, the devoted, he has
                            lost all this’, I gasped, turning away from the glass; and, throwing
                            myself on my knees by the bed, the sob I had so long suppressed broke
                            forth, and I tried to pray—</hi>” h’m—and so on, and so on, and so on—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You needn’t read all those bits about the prayers,’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘I
                        don’t think it is quite reverent.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well,’ said Laurence, ‘here’s a new stage of her life. Let us go on here.
                            “<hi>And now, from the bleak desolation of my present existence, I peer
                            wistfully out on all sides, and see if any will bring the love to me
                            that I so much crave for</hi>.”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Poor thing!’ said Mrs. Sinclair, with a little sigh. </p>
                    <p> ‘I’m afraid,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘I must mention, by the way, that the lady
                        is married, and remarkably well married too.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘“<hi>Here in the old house with its quiet gables,</hi>” Laurence went on
                        reading, “<hi>I sit in my own room, and watch the sunset dying away over the
                            yellowing autumn woods, itself the colour of a belated autumn leaf. I
                            watch it alone—yes, thank heaven, alone. I manage to steal for an hour
                            or two away from those people of whom the house is full. Who is there
                            amongst them that can understand me? whose spirit meets mine on equal
                            terms? I laugh with them, I talk with them, I jest with them, and they
                            think they know me. But ah! the weariness, the</hi> far-offness <hi>of
                            it all—</hi>”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘It is entirely her own fault,’ said Lady Ambrose,’ that she has these
                        people here. Her husband is devoted to the country and the turnips for their
                        own sake, and would never see a soul but a few of the neighbouring squires
                        and parsons, if she did not make him. In London, you know, she is nearly
                        always by herself. At least,’ Lady Ambrose added, ‘he’s very rarely with
                        her.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘A little further on,’ said Laurence, ‘it seems that all the visitors have
                        gone; and she has been to pay a visit to the parson’s wife.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You may be sure she was quite by herself if she did that,’ said Lady
                        Ambrose. </p>
                    <p> ‘Here,’ Laurence continued, ‘is a description of the visit. “<hi>What sweet
                            eyes the little thing had! What a look of trustfulness in her face! A
                            good and pure, and therefore a happy woman, if ever there was one. What
                            a trust in those eyes of hers! What an innocence! What a sweet content!
                            There is no purple shadow of care under</hi> her <hi>eyes—(people say I
                            darken mine artificially. Alas! heaven knows there is little need for me
                            to do that!) There is no secret trouble discernible in her lips—no
                            languor in her air! What does she know of life, with its troubles, its
                            distractions, its sins? Ah! were I but like her—I, world-worn and
                            world-weary, sickened with pomps, and vanities, and soiled affections,
                            and hollow homage—were I but worthy that she should talk to me! ‘Don’t
                            talk to me,’ I felt inclined to say. ‘You wouldn’t if you knew—if
                            you</hi> could <hi>know! Oh, how far better are you than I! You little
                            dream when I show myself demurely in my seat in the village church,
                            bowing at the Glorias, or kneeling with my face hid in my hands, you
                            little imagine what a woman you see there. You little dream what strange
                            thoughts unbidden mix themselves up for me with the hymn-music; what
                            wild regrets, what bitter reveries, what strange scenes and figures,
                            fill my mind as I kneel before the Communion-table. Why could I not have
                            been content like you with a quiet lot, a toiling honest husband like
                            you? Is there not something holy, even in his dull sermons, if you only
                            look on them in the lovely light of duty? Why does my heart vibrate with
                            the troubled wailing music of many sorrows, many longings, of which you
                            do not even dream the existence? Oh! what a far higher, far nobler woman
                            are you than I, in every way!</hi>”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘And now,’ said Lady Ambrose, seeing that Laurence had shut the book, ‘I
                        want to know if all this is a specimen of culture, and if you would call the
                        writer a cultivated person; because she is really one of the most delightful
                        people I know to talk to; and if this is what you call culture—though I
                        think, in her case, it’s a little bit affected, you know—but then she never
                        lets you see all this when you talk to her—I do quite from the bottom of my
                        heart give up about culture being priggish, and bookish, and all that; and
                        since, as you say, it really must include religion, I don’t see what we
                        could wish for more, to make life—humanly speaking—perfect. Of course we
                        shall do <hi>good</hi> sometimes—I mean, not forget the poor—there’s
                        something so wretchedly heartless in that, I think. And then, too,
                        politics—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ repeated Allen, ‘politics—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Of course,’ said Lady Ambrose, ‘it is necessary that some of us should look
                        after politics, because if we did not somebody else would. But still—(are
                        you a Liberal, Lord Allen?)—but still, within a limit, I think the
                            <hi>less</hi> we meddle the better.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Much, Lady Ambrose,’ said Mr. Rose, who had been somewhat put out by this
                        digression, ‘much is, no doubt, to be got over in your friend’s style; nor
                        do I think the culture displayed in her memoirs, even apart from that—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh, but you mustn’t judge her only by her writings,’ said Lady Ambrose.
                        ‘When you meet her, she is not a bit like them.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Amateurs in writing rarely are,’ said Laurence. ‘Their writings are simply
                        the foot-notes of their lives, where they tell you what they have not skill
                        enough to bring into the text.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘She draws beautifully,’ Lady Ambrose went on, ‘and is really the brightest
                        of creatures—so witty, and with such a sense of the ridiculous! And really,
                        to hear her tell a bit of scandal—not that I at all approve of scandal
                        myself—I always think it’s so uncharitable—’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Ah,’ said Donald Gordon gently, ‘I have the very highest opinion of
                        scandal. It is founded on the most sacred of things—that is, Truth, and it
                        is built up by the most beautiful of things—that is, Imagination.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, Mr. Gordon,’ said Lady Ambrose, smiling, ‘we won’t talk about that
                        now. But as for what you say about style, Mr. Rose, it is rather jerky, and
                        so forth, I admit. However, that’s the way with us women. Indeed, I often
                        think that if women had invented language, it would have consisted mainly of
                        interjections, and that its only stop would have been a note of
                        exclamation.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Rose was much annoyed at these interruptions. </p>
                    <p> ‘I wanted to say,’ he went on, as soon as Lady Ambrose had ceased, ‘that I
                        think your friend’s memoirs more instructive from their very shortcomings,
                        as showing how the human mind—even if not exceptionally gifted —has come to
                        be an organism of increased delicacy and capacity, except when stunted by
                        the necessity of work, or of occupation that is other than voluntary, and
                        chosen for any object beyond itself. You have here, you see, that same
                        modern sense of the blending together of the outer and inner worlds; there
                        is the same delicate discrimination between the aesthetic aspects of the
                        different stages of life, and the nice gradation of moral colours: there is
                        the same fine self-consciousness, and consequent endeavour to give tone and
                        quality to her memories as they pass by her, in exquisite and complex ways.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ exclaimed Leslie suddenly, who had spoken but little all the evening,
                        ‘here, I think, is the crowning work of culture. It teaches each of us to
                        look back upon his own life, with all its wants, its relations, and its
                        possibilities, all its wasted hours and its affections trifled away or
                        degraded—it teaches us to look back upon all this with quite a new kind of
                        discrimination. The beauty of youth, with all its buoyancy and innocence,
                        wakes in us of the modern world a more wistful and solemn regret; we are
                        more keenly alive to the pathos of failure; to the sadness of the cold
                        shadows that will often darken the whole inward landscape, and the ravage
                        made by the storms that will sometimes break over it; and to the gleams of
                        sunshine fitfully reappearing, often only touching its distant wolds. And
                        the charm of this is,’ Leslie went on, with a short laugh, ‘that however
                        disastrous our lives may have been, whatever shipwreck we may have made of
                        ourselves or others, let us only look back on this with the eyes of culture,
                        whilst “<hi>es wiederholt die Klage des Lebens labyrinthisch irren
                        Lauf</hi>,” and the whole retrospect becomes a delightful picture, the more
                        impressive and suggestive from its landslips, its broken roads, and its
                        waste places. I really think one is repaid for having made oneself quite
                        lonely, and deserted, and friendless, by the pleasure one gets from
                        contemplating one’s own situation.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I cannot bear that man,’ whispered Lady Ambrose to Miss Merton. ‘Didn’t you
                        notice the nasty way in which all that was said? But—good gracious, Mr.
                        Laurence, what is that bell ringing for in the house? Is that for us to
                        leave off talking? We have not half done yet.’ </p>
                    <p> Laurence smiled, and looked a little shy, and murmured that he did not think
                        it was so late. ‘I don’t know whether you’ll mind,’ he said at last, ‘but
                        our Rector is going to give us a little evening service. He proposed it this
                        afternoon in the garden, and I could not well refuse.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Mind it!’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose. ‘I should think not.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Service!’ said Dr. Jenkinson briskly; ‘yes, come and let us go to that. I
                        think,’ he said, looking round him, ‘that you will find the religion we have
                        is the best for us at present. I think so. And Christianity,’ he added,
                        turning to Mr. Stockton, ‘really embraces all religions, even any honest
                        denial of itself.’ </p>
                    <p> There was now a general movement towards the house. </p>
                    <p> ‘I’m afraid,’ said Mrs. Sinclair to Leslie, ‘that you’re not of a very happy
                        disposition. You don’t look happy, somehow. And yet I think you might be, if
                        you only tried. I suppose <hi>you’re</hi> not out of spirits like Mr.
                        Laurence, because you don’t believe in the Trinity, are you? Just look at
                        the sea now. Isn’t that beautiful? Don’t you care for that? But I, you
                        know,’ she added with a sigh, ‘disagree with Mr. Luke. <hi>I</hi> want the
                        notion of a personal deity, to make me enjoy nature. I want my thought to
                        pass away to him. But I don’t mean a vague deity; but some one whom I have
                        myself made a deity, and who, therefore, I can be quite sure exists—do you
                        see?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘My dear,’ said Lady Ambrose again to Miss Merton, ‘I really cannot bear Mr.
                        Leslie. I feel quite sure he’s a bad man. And the way he sneers and laughs
                        at things does go so against me. I wouldn’t have that man inside my house,
                        do you know, for anything. I know you don’t think so; but then you Roman
                        Catholics believe so much, you can afford to be liberal. Not that I myself
                        am at all bigoted; indeed, the one thing I think we want is toleration and
                        charity. And do you know, my dear,’ Lady Ambrose added as they were entering
                        the house, ‘I have a set of eight cousins, all unmarried; and when I look at
                        those girls’ faces, I do confess, my dear, that I positively wish your
                        religion was true; for then they could all go into convents. One doesn’t
                        like those half-and-half Protestant things, you know.’ </p>
                    <p> Just at this moment, emerging from the house, pale and disappointed,
                        appeared the figure of Mr. Saunders. </p>
                    <p> ‘It is thrown away,’ he exclaimed; ‘my disproof of God’s existence. The
                        under-housemaid did it! I am pleased to discover, however, that she
                        previously read through a part; so it has not perished, I trust, without
                        emancipating one spirit. What! are you all going indoors?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Mr. Storks, laying his arm on Mr. Saunders’s shoulder; ‘and you
                        had better come too. Young man,’ he said in a voice of commanding kindness,
                        ‘you should never in this virulent way deny God’s existence. What rational
                        man believes in it?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘ before dinner,’ said Mr. Rose, who with Laurence was bringing up the rear,
                        ‘at the books in your uncle’s pavilion in the garden; and I saw there, in a
                        closed case, a copy of the “Cultes secrets des Dames Romaines.”’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Well?’ said Laurence a little stiffly. ‘It has been locked up for years.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I conceived as much,’ said Mr. Rose gently. ‘As you do not seem to set much
                        store by the work, I will give you thirty pounds for it.’ </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
                    <p> ONCE more the theatre was brightly lighted; and once more the congregation
                        was assembled in the tier of boxes. There was not so much excitement as
                        there had been in the morning; indeed, the reserved decorum that reigned
                        might have been said to partake almost of the nature of apathy. When,
                        however, Dr. Seydon entered, none could deny that he did indeed look a
                        reverend man; and the very aspect of the place seemed to grow devotional at
                        his presence. Lady Ambrose perceived with a full heart that he was duly
                        habited in a surplice; and her bosom warmed with a sense of safety and of
                        comfort as he took his place and solemnly produced his prayer-book. Nor was
                        Lady Ambrose alone in this sudden stir of feeling. There was another of the
                        worshippers who was moved even more strongly, though in a slightly different
                        way. Many starts had been given on the stage in that theatre; but none of
                        these, it may be safely said, ever equalled one now given in the boxes, as
                        Dr. Jenkinson, who had been kneeling with his face hid in his hands, raised
                        his eyes, and saw for the first time who it was confronting him—no obscure
                        rural clergyman, as he had anticipated, but that illiberal apologist of
                        superstition, whose officious bigotry had robbed the Upper House of its most
                        enlightened spiritual peer. Dr. Jenkinson, however, with the heroism of a
                        true martyr, suffered bravely for his faith in the comprehensiveness of
                        Christianity. His face assumed, in another moment, an expression of cherubic
                        suavity; in his gentlest and devoutest tones he was soon taking his part in
                        the whole service, and that too with such an exquisite clearness of
                        articulation, that, amongst the confused murmurs of the rest, the entire
                        evening office sounded like a duet between him and Dr. Seydon. It is true
                        that there was something in the ring of this one audible voice that gave the
                        latter a sense of something being wrong somewhere; but luckily, being a
                        little shortsighted, he could not recognise the owner of it; and Dr.
                        Jenkinson, feeling no manner of call to endure the sermon, retired furtively
                        as soon as the prayers were over. </p>
                    <p> ‘Weren’t they read beautifully!’ said Lady Ambrose to Lady Grace in a
                        whisper. ‘Oh, how glad I shall be to hear him preach once again!’ she added,
                        as Dr. Seydon, having risen from his knees, retired, his hands clasped
                        before him, through the side door. Lady Ambrose, however, was entirely alone
                        in this gladness. Most of the others dreaded the sermon that was imminent,
                        and some even meditated following Dr. Jenkinson. But events were too quick
                        for them. Hardly, it seemed, had Dr. Seydon left the stalls, than the
                        curtain drew rapidly up, and displayed again the gorge in the Indian
                        Caucasus, only with a preacher in it very different from the one who had
                        stood there in the morning. The whole congregation gave a sudden gasp of
                        surprise. It was not Dr. Seydon that they saw. It was Mr. Herbert. </p>
                    <p> With a gracious gravity he advanced towards the footlights; and made a
                        slight bow to the house—a bow of deprecation and apology. </p>
                    <p> ‘A little while ago, in the garden,’ he said, ‘I confessed to our kind host,
                        Mr. Laurence, that there were a few things that I should like quietly to say
                        to you; and Mr. Laurence has become sponsor for you all, and has promised,
                        in your names, that you would suffer me to say them here. It is true,’ Mr.
                        Herbert went on, with a smile and a wave of his hand, ‘that when I look
                        round me at this glittering semicircle, I begin to feel not a little shy of
                        you, and to repent of my own temerity. You, however, have given me to-day so
                        much good food for reflection, that I feel bound, in the commonest honesty,
                        to make what poor return I can. So remember, that if I weary you, you have
                        really brought it upon yourselves. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well—to begin, then. You think me—you need not deny it, for I know you
                        think me—a somewhat crotchety and melancholy individual, averse to modern
                        knowledge and to modern progress, and seeing, as a rule, everything very
                        yellow indeed, with his jaundiced eyes. But I think myself that I am not by
                        any means so obstinate and so wrong-headed as I am quite aware that I appear
                        to you; nay, my own opinion is that I err, rather, in not being quite
                        obstinate enough. It is true that I have persistently pointed out that
                        England is at present given over wholly to ignoble pursuits, and is ruining
                        herself with deadly industries. But I have never said hitherto, so far as I
                        know, that we might not rally, and that a brighter future might not be in
                        store for us. Nay, I hailed a piece of news to-day with the most unfeigned
                        delight, which seemed an omen to me that such a brighter future actually was
                        in store for us. In a paper that reached me this afternoon there was a
                        letter on the prospects of the English iron trade; and I read in that letter
                        that nineteen foundries in Middlesborough have been closed within the last
                        three months, and the Moloch fires in their blast-furnaces extinguished;
                        that ten more foundries in the same place are scarcely able to continue
                        work, and must very shortly be closed likewise; and that the dense
                        smoke-cloud that so long has darkened that whole country is beginning to
                        clear away, and will open ere long upon astonished human eyes, that have
                        never yet beheld it, the liquid melted blue of the deep wells of the sky. It
                        is quite true that this indication of a reviving prosperity for our country
                        suggests more than it proves. But at any rate it put me this afternoon, when
                        I joined your party, into quite a right and hopeful mood for appreciating
                        your conceptions of a better order of things. It is in fact simply to
                        explain my appreciation that I am, in this most unconscionable way, now
                        detaining you. </p>
                    <p> ‘Let me say in the first place, then, how profoundly right I consider the
                        manner in which you set to work. For it is one of the most vital of all
                        truths, that in a perfect state all the parts will be perfect; and that if
                        the highest classes be as good as they can be, so also will be all the other
                        classes. And I want to tell you, in the next place, how entirely fair and
                        lovely did all the elements seem to be, out of which you composed for your
                        higher classes their ideal existence. For you gave them every outward grace
                        that could adorn life, and every inward taste and emotion that could enrich
                        it, and every species of intellectual activity that could stimulate it. Your
                        society was indeed to be truly the <hi>crème de la crème</hi>: it was to be
                        made beautiful, and profound, and brilliant, by lovers, and theologians, and
                        wits, and men of science, and poets, and philosophers, and humourists—all
                        men and women of the world, and fit to live in society, as well as to
                        educate it. This would indeed be, as was said at dinner, Rome and Athens and
                        Florence, at their best, and let me add Paris also, united and reanimated,
                        and enriched by the possession of yet wider knowledge, and the possibilities
                        of freer speculation. That truly is a dazzling picture. But even that is not
                        all. There was your city itself too, of which a lovely glimpse was given us,
                        with its groves, its gardens, its palaces, and its exquisite reproductions
                        of the world’s noblest architectures; and all this under our softest English
                        skies, and by our bluest English seas. Ah,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert, smiling,
                        and clasping his hands gently, ‘how I should like to live in a city like
                        that! I can literally see it now with my mind’s eye, whilst I am talking. I
                        see its private houses with their wonders of wrought marble; I see its
                        theatres, its museums, its chapels and churches of all denominations, its
                        scientific lecture rooms, and its convents. For what strikes me more
                        forcibly than anything is that all forms of faith and philosophy seem to
                        find here an impartial home, and to unite in animating one harmonious social
                        life. In fact, so vividly do I see this scene which your words have called
                        up before me, that I want very much, if you will let me, to acid one small
                        feature to it, myself. It is a very humble detail, this of mine. In the eyes
                        of the men of science, who lead modern thought, it is simply a sanitary
                        matter. It relates to the way in which you shall dispose of your dead. Now
                        in this, at least, you will be surprised to hear I quite keep pace with the
                        times, being a sincere advocate for cremation; and what I should want to do
                        in your city, would be to supply it with an establishment, hidden
                        underground, where the bodies of the dead should be turned into gas, in
                        properly devised retorts; the gas from each body being received in a small
                        separate gasometer. Above these gasworks, and amongst your fair towers and
                        spires, and your superb institutions, and art-galleries, I would build a
                        circular domed temple of umbred marble, blind and blank upon the face of it,
                        without carved work, and without window; only there should be written above
                        the portal, not as in Dante’s vision, <quote><l> Per me si va nell’ eterno
                                dolore,</l></quote> but one verse out of our English translation of
                        the Bible, for women and little children to read; and another verse out of a
                        Latin poet, which is, I believe, an equivalent for the original of that
                        translation, for men and scholars to read. The first should be, “Though
                        after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.” And
                        the other: <quote><l>   Quæris quo jaceas post obitum loco?</l></quote> And
                        within, around the dark walls, should be a number of separate shrines,
                        like—to use the simile that Dante would have chosen—the stalls in a great
                        stable; and to each shrine there should be a separate gas-jet. And when the
                        life of any was over, after the fire had done its work upon the dead body,
                        that man or woman who felt most bitterly the loss of the one that had been,
                        should repair to this temple, to an appointed shrine, and there, in silence
                        kneeling before it, should light the gas-jet; and thus evoking for the last
                        time that which was once so loved and loving, pass, with what thoughts might
                        be, a brief vigil before it, till its flicker grew slowly faint upon the
                        watcher’s face, and at length it went out and ended utterly and for ever.
                        And above, over these sanctuaries of bereavement and final leave-taking,
                        there should hang from the domed roof one rude iron lamp, always
                        burning—casting a pale flare upwards upon the darkness. This would be the
                        common lamp of the poor, for whose sake, dying, no one felt bereavement, or
                        whom no one at any rate could find time to say good-bye to; but who thus
                        united together, apart by themselves, would do all that would be at all
                        seemly in them—would remind you mutely and unobtrusively by their joint
                        light, that one thing at least they shared with you, namely death. It is not
                        of the poor, however, that I am mainly thinking now. It is of your higher
                        classes, who have leisure to feel sorrow and all its holy influences. And
                        these, I say, would find in this simple funeral service one that would meet
                        all their diverse needs, and be in tune with all their diverse feelings. It
                        would suit all. For to some it would symbolise an absolute disbelief in any
                        life beyond; and to all the rest it would symbolise a bewildered doubt about
                        any life beyond. For in one or other of these states of mind everyone would
                        be. </p>
                    <p> ‘Do you deny it?’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert, raising his voice suddenly, and
                        looking round the theatre with a passionate anger, at which the whole
                        audience were literally electrified. ‘Do you deny it?’ he exclaimed. ‘I tell
                        you that it is so. I tell you too that that is your own case, and that in
                        your Utopia you have aggravated the evil, and have not remedied it. You are
                        all deniers or doubters, I tell you, every one of you. The deniers, I know,
                        will not contradict me; so at present I need not speak to them. It is to
                        you—the majority, you who <hi>will</hi> contradict me; you who are so busy
                        with your various affirmations, with your prayers, your churches, your
                        philosophies, your revivals of old Christianities, or your new improvements
                        on them; with your love of justice, and humanity, and toleration; it is to
                        you that I speak. It is to you that I say that, however enlightened and
                        however sure you may be about all other matters, you are darkened and
                        uncertain as to this—whether there really is any God at all who can hear all
                        the prayers you utter to Him, or whether there really is any other life at
                        all, where the aspirations you are so proud of will be realised, and where
                        the wrongs you are so pitiful over will be righted. There is not one amongst
                        you who, watching a dead friend, flickering for the last time before you in
                        the form of a gas-flame, and seeing how a little while and this flame was
                        with you, and again a little while and it was not with you, would be at all
                        sure whether this was really because, as your hearts would suggest to you,
                        it went to the Father, or because, as your men of science would assert to
                        you, it went simply—out. </p>
                    <p> ‘Listen to me for a moment, and I can prove that this is so, to you. You are
                        rich, and you have leisure to think of things in what light you will, and
                        your life is to a great extent made easy for you by the labour of others. I
                        do not complain of that. There can be no civilisation without order, and
                        there can be no order without subordination. Outward goods must be
                        apportioned unequally, or there would be no outward goods to apportion. But
                        you who have the larger share of these are bound to do something for those
                        who have the less. I say you are <hi>bound</hi> to do so; or else sooner or
                        later that larger share will be taken away from you. Well, and what is it
                        you propose to do? I know your answer—I have heard it a thousand times. You
                        will educate them—you will teach them. And truly, if you know how to do that
                        properly, you will have done all you need do. But,’ exclaimed Mr. Herbert,
                        his voice again rising, and quivering with excitement, ‘that is just what
                        you do not know. I am not casting my words at random. Out of your own mouths
                        will I judge you. There never was a time when you talked so much as now
                        about teaching the people, and yet do not you yourselves confess that you
                        cannot agree together as to what to teach them? You can agree about teaching
                        them—I know this too well—countless things that you think will throw light
                        upon life; but life itself you leave a blank darkness upon which no light
                        can be thrown. You say nothing of what is good in it, and of what is evil.
                        Does success in it lie in the enjoyment of bodily pleasures, or in the doing
                        of spiritual duty? Is there anything in it that is right for its own sake,
                        or are all things right only because of their consequences? And seeing that,
                        if we struggle for virtue, our struggles can never be quite successful here,
                        is there any other place where they may have, I do not say their reward, but
                        their consummation? To these questions only two answers can be given, and
                        one must be entirely true, and the other entirely false. But you—you dare
                        not give either; you are too enlightened. It is true that <hi>you</hi> can
                        afford to be liberal about these matters; you can afford to consider truth
                        and falsehood equally <hi>tolerable</hi>. But for the poor man surely it is
                        not so. It must make some difference to him what you teach him, whether your
                        teaching is to open his eyes to his God and to his duty, and so place his
                        noblest happiness in his own hands, or whether it is to open his eyes to
                        those <hi>verified</hi> Utilitarian principles from which he will learn that
                        his own life and labour are only not utterly contemptible, because they
                        conduce to a material well-being in which he himself can have no share. If,
                        with entire belief yourselves, you are prepared to give him the former
                        teaching, why then it is well and good both for him and you. But if not,
                        beware of teaching him at all. You will but be removing a cataract from his
                        mind’s eye that he may stare aghast and piteous at his own poverty and
                        nakedness, or that he may gaze with a wild beast’s hunger at your own truly
                        noble prosperity which he can never taste, save in the wild beast’s way. </p>
                    <p> ‘But enough of the poor; enough of this division of happiness. Let me ask
                        you to consider now what sort of happiness there is to divide—I say divide,
                        meaning that you will get the whole of it. And as I have said before, this
                        happiness is very fair in seeming. Knowledge, and culture, and freedom, and
                        toleration—you have told us what fine things all these can do for you. And I
                        admit it myself too; I feel it myself too. Lovely, indeed, to look upon are
                        the faiths, the philosophies, the enthusiasms of the world—the ancient
                        products of the ages—as the sunshine of the modern intellect falls on them.
                        See, they look clearer, and brighter, and more transparent—see, they form
                        themselves into more exquisite and lucid shapes, more aërial structures. But
                        why? Do not deceive yourselves; it is for a terrible reason. It is because,
                        like a fabric of snow, they are one and all dissolving. </p>
                    <p> ‘Listen, and I will show you that this is so. Aristotle says that what is
                        truly a man’s Self is the thinking part of him. This sooner or later all the
                        other parts obey—sooner or later, willingly or unwillingly; and if this Self
                        be base, the whole man will be base; if the Self be noble, the whole man
                        will be noble. And as it is with the individual man, so it is with the ages
                        and the generations. They obey their several Selves, whatever these Selves
                        may be. The world once had a Self whose chief spokesman was a Jewish peasant
                        called Jesus; and sooner or later the world followed him. Later on, it had a
                        Self whose chief spokesmen were Dominics or Luthers or Loyolas; and in like
                        manner the world followed them. Later still, it had got another Self, and
                        the chief spokesmen of this were Voltaires and Rousseaus, And in each case
                        the world was convinced at heart, consciously or unconsciously, that the
                        vital truths of life were to be sought for only where these Selves sought
                        for them. With Jesus and with Luther it sought them in duty and in a turning
                        to the true God; with Voltaire and Rousseau, in justice, and in a turning
                        from the false God. And now, where do you seek them? Where does the Self of
                        your age seek them—your Self, that thinking part of you before which you all
                        either quail or worship? Does it seek them either in justice, or
                        loving-kindness, or in the vision of the most high God! No—but in the
                        rotting bodies of dead men, or in the writhing bodies of live cats. And in
                        your perplexity, and your amazed despair, ever and again you cry to it, What
                        shall we do to be saved? Show us the Father! Show us the high and holy One
                        that inhabiteth Eternity! And what does your Self answer you? It answers you
                        with a laugh, “There is no high and holy One at all. How say ye then to me,
                        Show us the Father? For the Earth saith, He is not with me; and the depth
                        saith, He is not with me; and our filthy phials of decaying animal matter
                        say, He is not with us. Argal, ye poor foolish seekers, He is nowhere.” You
                        may try to escape from your own Self, but you cannot; you may try to forget
                        its answer, but you cannot. Loudly you may affirm with your lips; but the
                        importunate denial is ever at your heart. <hi>Patriæ quis exsul se quoque
                            fugit?</hi>
                    </p>
                    <p> ‘What do you do then in this perplexity—this halting between two opinions?
                        Why, you do this. You try to persuade yourselves that neither opinion is of
                        much moment—that the question cannot be decided absolutely—that it should
                        not be decided absolutely—in fact, that it is one of your chief glories that
                        you leave it undecided. But I tell you, in that case, that though you say
                        you are rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; you are,
                        in reality, wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked. I am
                        not casting my words at random. Again out of your own mouths will I judge
                        you. All your culture, you say, is based ultimately upon this—a
                        discrimination between right and wrong. True, profoundly true. But will you
                        be able to say what is right and what is wrong any longer, if you don’t know
                            <hi>for whom</hi> anything is right and <hi>for whom</hi> anything is
                        wrong—whether it is for men with immortal souls, or only with mortal bodies—
                        who are only a little lower than the angels, or only a little better than
                        the pigs? Whilst you can still contrive to doubt upon this matter, whilst
                        the fabric of the old faith is still dissolving only, life still for you,
                        the enlightened few, may preserve what happiness it has now. But when the
                        old fabric is all dissolved, what then? When all divinity shall have gone
                        from love and heroism, and only utility and pleasure shall be left, what
                        then? Then you will have to content yourselves with complete denial; or
                        build up again the faith that you have just pulled down—you will have to be
                        born again, and to seek for a new Self. </p>
                    <p> ‘But suppose we accept denial, you will say, what then? Many deniers have
                        lived noble lives, though they have looked neither for a God nor for a
                        heaven. Think of Greece, you will say to me, and that will answer you.
                        No—but that is not so, and that will not answer me. The Greeks never, in
                        your sense, denied God; they never, in your sense, denied eternal
                        life—never, because they never knew them. They <hi>felt</hi> God only; they
                        felt him unconsciously; and in denying the God they knew, they were really
                        affirming the God they felt. But you—do not you deceive yourselves. Do not
                        think you can ever again be as the Greeks. The world’s progress has a
                        twofold motion. History moves onwards round some undiscovered centre, as
                        well as round what you consider its discovered axis; and though it seems to
                        repeat itself, it never can repeat itself. The Atheism of the modern world
                        is not the Atheism of the ancient: the long black night of the winter is not
                        the swift clear night of the vanished summer. The Greek philosopher could
                        not darken his life, for he knew not from what mysterious source the light
                        fell upon it. The modern philosopher does know, and he knows that it is
                        called God, and thus knowing the source of light he can at once quench it. </p>
                    <p> ‘What will be left you then if this light be quenched? Will art, will
                        painting, will poetry be any comfort to you? You have said that these were
                        magic mirrors which reflected back your life for you. Well—will they be any
                        better than the glass mirrors in your drawing-rooms, if they have nothing
                        but the same listless orgy to reflect? For that is all that will be at last
                        in store for you; nay, that is the best thing that possibly can be in store
                        for you; the only alternative being not a listless orgy for the few, but an
                        undreamed of anarchy for all. I do not fear that, however. Some will be
                        always strong, and some will be always weak; and though, if there is no God,
                        no divine and fatherly source of order, there will be, trust me, no
                        aristocracies, there will still be tyrannies. There will still be rich and
                        poor; and that will then mean happy and miserable; and the poor will be— as
                        I sometimes think they are already—but a mass of groaning machinery, without
                        even the semblance of rationality; and the rich, with only the semblance of
                        it, but a set of gaudy, dancing marionettes, which it is the machinery’s one
                        work to keep in motion. </p>
                    <p> ‘What, then, shall you do to be saved? Rend your hearts, I say, and do not
                        mend your garments. Seek God earnestly, and peradventure you still may find
                        Him—and I—even I may find Him also. For I—who am I that speak to you? Am I a
                        believer? No, I am a doubter too. Once I could pray every morning, and go
                        forth to my day’s labour stayed and comforted. But now I can pray no longer.
                        You have taken my God away from me, and I know not where you have laid Him.
                        My only consolation in my misery is that at least I am inconsolable for His
                        loss. Yes,’ cried Mr. Herbert, his voice rising into a kind of threatening
                        wail, ‘though you have made me miserable, I am not yet content with my
                        misery. And though I too have said in my heart that there is no God, and
                        that there is no more profit in wisdom than in folly, yet there is one folly
                        that I will not give tongue to. I will not say Peace, peace, when there is
                        no peace. I will not say we are still Christians, when we can sip our wine
                        smilingly after dinner, and talk about some day defining the Father; and I
                        will only pray that if such a Father be, He may have mercy alike upon those
                        that hate Him, because they <hi>will</hi> not see Him; and on those who love
                        and long for Him, although they no longer <hi>can</hi> see Him.’ </p>
                    <p> Mr. Herbert’s voice ceased. The curtain fell. The whirlwind was over; the
                        fire was over; and after the fire, from one of the side boxes came a still
                        small voice. </p>
                    <p> ‘Very poor taste—very poor taste.’ </p>
                    <p> It was perceived that Dr. Jenkinson, having discovered almost immediately
                        who was really to be the preacher, had stolen back silently into the
                        theatre. </p>

                    <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
                    <p> THE following morning Miss Merton had risen early, and was sauntering slowly
                        before breakfast up and down the broad terrace in front of the house. She
                        inhaled the fresh delightful air; she looked out over the breezy sea; she
                        scanned the splendid villa, now shining in the sunlight, with its marble
                        porticoes, and its long rows of windows; and she thought over yesterday with
                        all its conversations and incidents. In especial, she thought of Laurence.
                        She thought of him as he was now, and as he had been in former times, when
                        they had known each other so well; and as she thought of him, she sighed. </p>
                    <p> ‘And he might do so much,’ she said to herself, ‘and yet he is so weak and
                        so irresolute; wasting his time in Paris and in London, reading poetry and
                        buying pictures, and talking philosophy he doesn’t believe in with his
                        dilettante friends. And this place—this lovely place—how often does he come
                        here? What does he do for his tenants and dependants—for all who ought to
                        look for help to him? I have no patience with a man who keeps moaning about
                        religion as he does, and yet won’t act up to the light which he must have.’ </p>
                    <p> Whilst she was thus meditating, the subject of her meditations appeared upon
                        the terrace. </p>
                    <p> ‘You are out early,’ he said. ‘I have been just seeing Herbert off. He has
                        had to go before, everybody else, for he is <hi>en route</hi> for Italy.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘You look very tired,’ said Miss Merton sympathetically. </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh, it is nothing,’ said Laurence, turning the subject. ‘Did you notice
                        Leslie last evening in the garden, and how odd his manner was? Do you
                        remember, too, the pretty song he sang the night before, and how surprised
                        we all were at it? Well, I had a letter yesterday, from a friend both of his
                        and mine, which explains it. The heroine of the song was not an ideal young
                        lady, though whether one can call her real any longer is more than I can
                        say. She is dead. I don’t know all the story; but my friend just gave me the
                        outline, and enclosed a note for Leslie, to tell the news to him himself. He
                        never fancies he feels anything; but what he won’t admit to himself, his
                        manner, I am sure admitted to me, and I dare say to you too.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Yes,’ said Miss Merton thoughtfully, ‘I felt sure it must be something of
                        that kind. But you,’ she said, turning to Laurence, ‘how utterly tired and
                        worn-out you look.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘To say the truth,’ Laurence answered, ‘I slept very little last night. I
                        was thinking of our culture and our enlightenment. I was thinking of—God
                        knows what; and why should I tell you? I’m sorry,’ he said, ‘that we’re all
                        breaking up to-day. I wish we could have kept the party together for a
                        little longer. I don’t know what I shall do. I can’t stop here; I shan’t go
                        to London—I hate London. I had almost resolved, an hour ago, to go off to
                        Italy with Herbert.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘By way of finding some duty to do?’ asked Miss Merton quietly. </p>
                    <p> ‘I <hi>have</hi> no duties,’ said Laurence. ‘Didn’t Herbert very truly tell
                        us so last night? But in Italy I should at least forget that I ever might
                        have had any. And I should be then, at any rate, with a congenial friend.
                        Herbert and I, you see, are two fools. We both of us want to pray, and we
                        neither of us can.’ </p>
                    <p> There was a long pause. At last Miss Merton said with some embarrassment,
                        stooping as she did so to smell a red geranium: </p>
                    <p> ‘I’m sure I wish I could be of any use to you; but really I don’t quite see
                        how I can.’ </p>
                    <p> There was another pause. At last Laurence said in a very low tone: </p>
                    <p> ‘I cannot pray, because I do not believe in God. Will you pray for me? ’ </p>
                    <p> Miss Merton turned and looked at him with a soft, serious smile. </p>
                    <p> ‘I did last night, if you wish very much to know,’ she said, and her cheek
                        grew slowly tinted with an unconscious blush. </p>
                    <p> ‘Did you?’ exclaimed Laurence with a sudden eagerness. ‘Then, if you cared
                        enough for me to do that, will you care enough for me to do something far
                        better than praying for me? Will you—’ he said, pausing and looking at her;
                        ‘will you—’ But at that instant the gong for breakfast sounded, and the
                        sentence died unfinished. Both he and she were perhaps a little grateful for
                        this interruption. It relieved a sudden sense of shyness that had become
                        painful, and to all intents and purposes their looks had already said all
                        that need be said. It might, both felt, be securely left to find its way
                        into words at a more convenient season. In another moment they were in the
                        midst of that most matter-of-fact bustle that precedes in country-houses the
                        settling down to breakfast of a large party. </p>
                    <p> ‘Well, Mr. Laurence,’ exclaimed Lady Ambrose, ‘all pleasant things come to
                        an end at last. But this visit to you has really been positively delightful.
                        And now, you must be careful not to forget me—that we are expecting you in
                        September in Gloucestershire, to take part in our private theatricals.
                        By-the-by,’ she added, sinking her voice to a fit solemnity, ‘I think I told
                        you, didn’t I, how ill the poor Duchess of ——— had been last week, though
                        she’s better now, I am happy to hear this morning.
                        Ham—tongue—pigeon-pie—omelette,’ she went on, as she sat down at the table;
                        ‘why, amongst all this host of good things, I don’t know really what to
                        choose. Well, suppose, Mr. Laurence, you were to bring me just the
                        little—least bit of omelette. My dear,’ she whispered to Miss Merton, who
                        was on one side of her, ‘what a dreadful blowing-up Mr. Herbert gave us last
                        night, didn’t he? Now that, you know, I think is all very well in a sermon,
                        but in a lecture, where the things are supposed to be taken more or less
                        literally, I think it is a little out of place.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Did you say just now,’ said Leslie, who found himself on the other side of
                        Lady Ambrose, ‘that the Duchess of ——— was ill?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Oh, it was just something I was telling Mr. Laurence,’ said Lady Ambrose
                        coldly. ‘She’s much better now, thank you. Do you know her?’ </p>
                    <p> ‘She’s my aunt,’ said Leslie. </p>
                    <p> Lady Ambrose turned round and looked Leslie full in the face. As she looked,
                        a smile began to dimple her cheek, and light up her sweet grey eyes. </p>
                    <p> ‘You <hi>don’t</hi> say so!’ she exclaimed at last. ‘Why, of course you are.
                        How stupid of me not to have found that out before. To be sure—you are the
                        redoubtable Eton boy, who made such a dreadful commotion at Daleham by
                        wanting to run away with the nursery governess. And to think that I have
                        only discovered you at this last moment, when we are all of us going to say
                        good-bye!’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Your carriage is at the door, my Lady,’ said a servant. </p>
                    <p> ‘Already!’ said Lady Ambrose. ‘How time flies! Dr. Jenkinson, you and I are
                        going to the train together, I believe. And now, Mr. Leslie,’ she went on,
                        ‘Mr. Laurence is coming to us, in September, for some private theatricals. I
                        don’t know if you do anything in that way yourself. But perhaps if you are
                        in England, and have no better engagements, you will come with him. At any
                        rate, if you won’t, please to remember I shall think it very ill-natured of
                        you.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘Thank you,’ said Leslie, smiling, ‘I am not ill-natured.’ </p>
                    <p> ‘I’m quite ready, Lady Ambrose, if you are,’ said Dr. Jenkinson briskly;
                        ‘and now, Laurence,’ he said, as he was standing in the portico, whilst Lady
                        Ambrose was getting into the carriage, ‘good-bye; I’ve had a most pleasant
                        visit. But as to your Utopia, your ideal of the future—’ he added
                        confidentially, ‘it has been said, foolishly enough, that God was the
                        Brocken-phantom of self, projected on the mists of the <hi>non-ego</hi>.
