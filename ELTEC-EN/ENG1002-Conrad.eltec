            <head>PART FIRST</head>


            <p>To begin with I wish to disclaim the possession of those high gifts of imagination
                and expression which would have enabled my pen to create for the reader the
                personality of the man who called himself, after the Russian custom, Cyril son of
                Isidor — Kirylo Sidorovitch — Razumov.</p>

            <p>If I have ever had these gifts in any sort of living form they have been smothered
                out of existence a long time ago under a wilderness of words. Words, as is well
                known, are the great foes of reality. I have been for many years a teacher of
                languages. It is an occupation which at length becomes fatal to whatever share of
                imagination, observation, and insight an ordinary person may be heir to. To a
                teacher of languages there comes a time when the world is but a place of many words
                and man appears a mere talking animal not much more wonderful than a parrot.</p>

            <p>This being so, I could not have observed Mr. Razumov or guessed at his reality by the
                force of insight, much less have imagined him as he was. Even to invent the mere
                bald facts of his life would have been utterly beyond my powers. But I think that
                without this declaration the readers of these pages will be able to detect in the
                story the marks of documentary evidence. And that is perfectly correct. It is based
                on a document; all I have brought to it is my knowledge of the Russian language,
                which is sufficient for what is attempted here. The document, of course, is
                something in the nature of a journal, a diary, yet not exactly that in its actual
                form. For instance, most of it was not written up from day to day, though all the
                entries are dated. Some of these entries cover months of time and extend over dozens
                of pages. All the earlier part is a retrospect, in a narrative form, relating to an
                event which took place about a year before.</p>

            <p>I must mention that I have lived for a long time in Geneva. A whole quarter of that
                town, on account of many Russians residing there, is called La Petite Russie —
                Little Russia. I had a rather extensive connexion in Little Russia at that time. Yet
                I confess that I have no comprehension of the Russian character. The illogicality of
                their attitude, the arbitrariness of their conclusions, the frequency of the
                exceptional, should present no difficulty to a student of many grammars; but there
                must be something else in the way, some special human trait — one of those subtle
                differences that are beyond the ken of mere professors. What must remain striking to
                a teacher of languages is the Russians’ extraordinary love of words. They gather
                them up; they cherish them, but they don’t hoard them in their breasts; on the
                contrary, they are always ready to pour them out by the hour or by the night with an
                enthusiasm, a sweeping abundance, with such an aptness of application sometimes
                that, as in the case of very accomplished parrots, one can’t defend oneself from the
                suspicion that they really understand what they say. There is a generosity in their
                ardour of speech which removes it as far as possible from common loquacity; and it
                is ever too disconnected to be classed as eloquence. . . . But I must apologize for
                this digression.</p>

            <p>It would be idle to inquire why Mr. Razumov has left this record behind him. It is
                inconceivable that he should have wished any human eye to see it. A mysterious
                impulse of human nature comes into play here. Putting aside Samuel Pepys, who has
                forced in this way the door of immortality, innumerable people, criminals, saints,
                philosophers, young girls, statesmen, and simple imbeciles, have kept self-
                revealing records from vanity no doubt, but also from other more inscrutable
                motives. There must be a wonderful soothing power in mere words since so many men
                have used them for self- communion. Being myself a quiet individual I take it that
                what all men are really after is some form or perhaps only some formula of peace.
                Certainly they are crying loud enough for it at the present day. What sort of peace
                Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov expected to find in the writing up of his record it
                passeth my understanding to guess.</p>

            <p>The fact remains that he has written it.</p>

            <p>Mr. Razumov was a tall, well-proportioned young man, quite unusually dark for a
                Russian from the Central Provinces. His good looks would have been unquestionable if
                it had not been for a peculiar lack of fineness in the features. It was as if a face
                modelled vigorously in wax (with some approach even to a classical correctness of
                type) had been held close to a fire till all sharpness of line had been lost in the
                softening of the material. But even thus he was sufficiently good-looking. His
                manner, too, was good. In discussion he was easily swayed by argument and authority.
                With his younger compatriots he took the attitude of an inscrutable listener, a
                listener of the kind that hears you out intelligently and then — just changes the
                subject.</p>

            <p>This sort of trick, which may arise either from intellectual insufficiency or from an
                imperfect trust in one’s own convictions, procured for Mr. Razumov a reputation of
                profundity. Amongst a lot of exuberant talkers, in the habit of exhausting
                themselves daily by ardent discussion, a comparatively taciturn personality is
                naturally credited with reserve power. By his comrades at the St. Petersburg
                University, Kirylo Sidorovitch Razumov, third year’s student in philosophy, was
                looked upon as a strong nature — an altogether trustworthy man. This, in a country
                where an opinion may be a legal crime visited by death or sometimes by a fate worse
                than mere death, meant that he was worthy of being trusted with forbidden opinions.
                He was liked also for his amiability and for his quiet readiness to oblige his
                comrades even at the cost of personal inconvenience.</p>

            <p>Mr. Razumov was supposed to be the son of an Archpriest and to be protected by a
                distinguished nobleman — perhaps of his own distant province. But his outward
                appearance accorded badly with such humble origin. Such a descent was not credible.
                It was, indeed, suggested that Mr. Razumov was the son of an Archpriest’s pretty
                daughter — which, of course, would put a different complexion on the matter. This
                theory also rendered intelligible the protection of the distinguished nobleman. All
                this, however, had never been investigated maliciously or otherwise. No one knew or
                cared who the nobleman in question was. Razumov received a modest but very
                sufficient allowance from the hands of an obscure attorney, who seemed to act as his
                guardian in some measure. Now and then he appeared at some professor’s informal
                reception. Apart from that Razumov was not known to have any social relations in the
                town. He attended the obligatory lectures regularly and was considered by the
                authorities as a very promising student. He worked at home in the manner of a man
                who means to get on, but did not shut himself up severely for that purpose. He was
                always accessible, and there was nothing secret or reserved in his life.</p>

        <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="chapter">

            <head>1</head>


            <p>The origin of Mr. Razumov’s record is connected with an event characteristic of
                modern Russia in the actual fact: the assassination of a prominent statesman — and
                still more characteristic of the moral corruption of an oppressed society where the
                noblest aspirations of humanity, the desire of freedom, an ardent patriotism, the
                love of justice, the sense of pity, and even the fidelity of simple minds are
                prostituted to the lusts of hate and fear, the inseparable companions of an uneasy
                despotism.</p>

            <p>The fact alluded to above is the successful attempt on the life of Mr. de P— — the
                President of the notorious Repressive Commission of some years ago, the Minister of
                State invested with extraordinary powers. The newspapers made noise enough about
                that fanatical, narrow-chested figure in gold-laced uniform, with a face of crumpled
                parchment, insipid, bespectacled eyes, and the cross of the Order of St. Procopius
                hung under the skinny throat. For a time, it may be remembered, not a month passed
                without his portrait appearing in some one of the illustrated papers of Europe. He
                served the monarchy by imprisoning, exiling, or sending to the gallows men and
                women, young and old, with an equable, unwearied industry. In his mystic acceptance
                of the principle of autocracy he was bent on extirpating from the land every vestige
                of anything that resembled freedom in public institutions; and in his ruthless
                persecution of the rising generation he seemed to aim at the destruction of the very
                hope of liberty itself.</p>

            <p>It is said that this execrated personality had not enough imagination to be aware of
                the hate he inspired. It is hardly credible; but it is a fact that he took very few
                precautions for his safety. In the preamble of a certain famous State paper he had
                declared once that “the thought of liberty has never existed in the Act of the
                Creator. From the multitude of men’s counsel nothing could come but revolt and
                disorder; and revolt and disorder in a world created for obedience and stability is
                sin. It was not Reason but Authority which expressed the Divine Intention. God was
                the Autocrat of the Universe . . . .” It may be that the man who made this
                declaration believed that heaven itself was bound to protect him in his remorseless
                defence of Autocracy on this earth.</p>

            <p>No doubt the vigilance of the police saved him many times; but, as a matter of fact,
                when his appointed fate overtook him, the competent authorities could not have given
                him any warning. They had no knowledge of any conspiracy against the Minister’s
                life, had no hint of any plot through their usual channels of information, had seen
                no signs, were aware of no suspicious movements or dangerous persons.</p>

            <p>Mr. de P—— was being driven towards the railway station in a two-horse uncovered
                sleigh with footman and coachman on the box. Snow had been falling all night, making
                the roadway, uncleared as yet at this early hour, very heavy for the horses. It was
                still falling thickly. But the sleigh must have been observed and marked down. As it
                drew over to the left before taking a turn, the footman noticed a peasant walking
                slowly on the edge of the pavement with his hands in the pockets of his sheepskin
                coat and his shoulders hunched up to his ears under the falling snow. On being
                overtaken this peasant suddenly faced about and swung his arm. In an instant there
                was a terrible shock, a detonation muffled in the multitude of snowflakes; both
                horses lay dead and mangled on the ground and the coachman, with a shrill cry, had
                fallen off the box mortally wounded. The footman (who survived) had no time to see
                the face of the man in the sheepskin coat. After throwing the bomb this last got
                away, but it is supposed that, seeing a lot of people surging up on all sides of him
                in the falling snow, and all running towards the scene of the explosion, he thought
                it safer to turn back with them.</p>

            <p>In an incredibly short time an excited crowd assembled round the sledge. The
                Minister- President, getting out unhurt into the deep snow, stood near the groaning
                coachman and addressed the people repeatedly in his weak, colourless voice: “I beg
                of you to keep off: For the love of God, I beg of you good people to keep off.”</p>

            <p>It was then that a tall young man who had remained standing perfectly still within a
                carriage gateway, two houses lower down, stepped out into the street and walking up
                rapidly flung another bomb over the heads of the crowd. It actually struck the
                Minister-President on the shoulder as he stooped over his dying servant, then
                falling between his feet exploded with a terrific concentrated violence, striking
                him dead to the ground, finishing the wounded man and practically annihilating the
                empty sledge in the twinkling of an eye. With a yell of horror the crowd broke up
                and fled in all directions, except for those who fell dead or dying where they stood
                nearest to the Minister-President, and one or two others who did not fall till they
                had run a little way.</p>

            <p>The first explosion had brought together a crowd as if by enchantment, the second
                made as swiftly a solitude in the street for hundreds of yards in each direction.
                Through the falling snow people looked from afar at the small heap of dead bodies
                lying upon each other near the carcases of the two horses. Nobody dared to approach
                till some Cossacks of a street-patrol galloped up and, dismounting, began to turn
                over the dead. Amongst the innocent victims of the second explosion laid out on the
                pavement there was a body dressed in a peasant’s sheepskin coat; but the face was
                unrecognisable, there was absolutely nothing found in the pockets of its poor
                clothing, and it was the only one whose identity was never established.</p>

            <p>That day Mr. Razumov got up at his usual hour and spent the morning within the
                University buildings listening to the lectures and working for some time in the
                library. He heard the first vague rumour of something in the way of bomb-throwing at
                the table of the students’ ordinary, where he was accustomed to eat his two o’clock
                dinner. But this rumour was made up of mere whispers, and this was Russia, where it
                was not always safe, for a student especially, to appear too much interested in
                certain kinds of whispers. Razumov was one of those men who, living in a period of
                mental and political unrest, keep an instinctive hold on normal, practical, everyday
                life. He was aware of the emotional tension of his time; he even responded to it in
                an indefinite way. But his main concern was with his work, his studies, and with his
                own future.</p>

            <p>Officially and in fact without a family (for the daughter of the Archpriest had long
                been dead), no home influences had shaped his opinions or his feelings. He was as
                lonely in the world as a man swimming in the deep sea. The word Razumov was the mere
                label of a solitary individuality. There were no Razumovs belonging to him anywhere.
                His closest parentage was defined in the statement that he was a Russian. Whatever
                good he expected from life would be given to or withheld from his hopes by that
                connexion alone. This immense parentage suffered from the throes of internal
                dissensions, and he shrank mentally from the fray as a good-natured man may shrink
                from taking definite sides in a violent family quarrel.</p>

            <p>Razumov, going home, reflected that having prepared all the matters of the
                forthcoming examination, he could now devote his time to the subject of the prize
                essay. He hankered after the silver medal. The prize was offered by the Ministry of
                Education; the names of the competitors would be submitted to the Minister himself.
                The mere fact of trying would be considered meritorious in the higher quarters; and
                the possessor of the prize would have a claim to an administrative appointment of
                the better sort after he had taken his degree. The student Razumov in an access of
                elation forgot the dangers menacing the stability of the institutions which give
                rewards and appointments. But remembering the medallist of the year before, Razumov,
                the young man of no parentage, was sobered. He and some others happened to be
                assembled in their comrade’s rooms at the very time when that last received the
                official advice of his success. He was a quiet, unassuming young man: “ Forgive me,”
                he had said with a faint apologetic smile and taking up his cap, “ I am going out to
                order up some wine. But I must first send a telegram to my folk at home. I say!
                Won’t the old people make it a festive time for the neighbours for twenty miles
                around our place.”</p>

            <p>Razumov thought there was nothing of that sort for him in the world. His success
                would matter to no one. But he felt no bitterness against the nobleman his
                protector, who was not a provincial magnate as was generally supposed. He was in
                fact nobody less than Prince K— — once a great and splendid figure in the world and
                now, his day being over, a Senator and a gouty invalid, living in a still splendid
                but more domestic manner. He had some young children and a wife as aristocratic and
                proud as himself.</p>

            <p>In all his life Razumov was allowed only once to come into personal contact with the
                Prince.</p>

            <p>It had the air of a chance meeting in the little attorney’s office. One day Razumov,
                coming in by appointment, found a stranger standing there — a tall,
                aristocratic-looking Personage with silky, grey sidewhiskers. The bald-headed, sly
                little lawyer-fellow called out, “Come in — come in, Mr. Razumov,” with a sort of
                ironic heartiness. Then turning deferentially to the stranger with the grand air, “A
                ward of mine, your, Excellency. One of the most promising students of his faculty in
                the St. Petersburg University.”</p>

            <p>To his intense surprise Razumov saw a white shapely hand extended to him. He took it
                in great confusion (it was soft and passive) and heard at the same time a
                condescending murmur in which he caught only the words “Satisfactory” and
                “Persevere.” But the most amazing thing of all was to feel suddenly a distinct
                pressure of the white shapely hand just before it was withdrawn: a light pressure
                like a secret sign. The emotion of it was terrible. Razumov’s heart seemed to leap
                into his throat. When he raised his eyes the aristocratic personage, motioning the
                little lawyer aside, had opened the door and was going out.</p>

            <p>The attorney rummaged amongst the papers on his desk for a time. “Do you know who
                that was?” he asked suddenly.</p>

            <p>Razumov, whose heart was thumping hard yet, shook his head in silence.</p>

            <p>“That was Prince K——. You wonder what he could be doing in the hole of a poor legal
                rat like myself — eh? These awfully great people have their sentimental curiosities
                like common sinners. But if I were you, Kirylo Sidorovitch,” he continued, leering
                and laying a peculiar emphasis on the patronymic,” I wouldn’t boast at large of the
                introduction. It would not be prudent, Kirylo Sidorovitch. Oh dear no! It would be
                in fact dangerous for your future.”</p>

            <p>The young man’s ears burned like fire; his sight was dim. “That man!” Razumov was
                saying to himself. “He!”</p>

            <p>Henceforth it was by this monosyllable that Mr. Razumov got into the habit of
                referring mentally to the stranger with grey silky side-whiskers. From that time
                too, when walking in the more fashionable quarters, he noted with interest the
                magnificent horses and carriages with Prince K——‘s liveries on the box. Once he saw
                the Princess get out — she was shopping — followed by two girls, of which one was
                nearly a head taller than the other. Their fair hair hung loose down their backs in
                the English style; they had merry eyes, their coats, muffs, and little fur caps were
                exactly alike, and their cheeks and noses were tinged a cheerful pink by the frost.
                They crossed the pavement in front of him, and Razumov went on his way smiling shyly
                to himself. “His” daughters. They resembled “Him.” The young man felt a glow of warm
                friendliness towards these girls who would never know of his existence. Presently
                they would marry Generals or Kammerherrs and have girls and boys of their own, who
                perhaps would be aware of him as a celebrated old professor, decorated, possibly a
                Privy Councillor, one of the glories of Russia — nothing more!</p>

            <p>But a celebrated professor was a somebody. Distinction would convert the label
                Razumov into an honoured name. There was nothing strange in the student Razumov’s
                wish for distinction. A man’s real life is that accorded to him in the thoughts of
                other men by reason of respect or natural love. Returning home on the day of the
                attempt on Mr. de P——‘s life Razumov resolved to have a good try for the silver
                medal.</p>

            <p>Climbing slowly the four flights of the dark, dirty staircase in the house where he
                had his lodgings, he felt confident of success. The winner’s name would be published
                in the papers on New Year’s Day. And at the thought that “He” would most probably
                read it there, Razumov stopped short on the stairs for an instant, then went on
                smiling faintly at his own emotion. “This is but a shadow,” he said to himself,” but
                the medal is a solid beginning.”</p>

            <p>With those ideas of industry in his head the warmth of his room was agreeable and
                encouraging. “I shall put in four hours of good work,” he thought. But no sooner had
                he closed the door than he was horribly startled. All black against the usual tall
                stove of white tiles gleaming in the dusk, stood a strange figure, wearing a
                skirted, close-fitting, brown cloth coat strapped round the waist, in long boots,
                and with a little Astrakhan cap on its head. It loomed lithe and martial. Razumov
                was utterly confounded. It was only when the figure advancing two paces asked in an
                untroubled, grave voice if the outer door was closed that he regained his power of
                speech.</p>

            <p>“Haldin! . . . Victor Victorovitch! . . . Is that you? . . . Yes. The outer door is
                shut all right. But this is indeed unexpected.”</p>

            <p>Victor Haldin, a student older than most of his contemporaries at the University, was
                not one of the industrious set. He was hardly ever seen at lectures; the authorities
                had marked him as “restless” and “unsound “— very bad notes. But he had a great
                personal prestige with his comrades and influenced their thoughts. Razumov had never
                been intimate with him. They had met from time to time at gatherings in other
                students’ houses. They had even had a discussion together — one of those discussions
                on first principles dear to the sanguine minds of youth.</p>

            <p>Razumov wished the man had chosen some other time to come for a chat. He felt in good
                trim to tackle the prize essay. But as Haldin could not be slightingly dismissed
                Razumov adopted the tone of hospitality, asking him to sit down and smoke.</p>

            <p>“Kirylo Sidorovitch,” said the other, flinging off his cap, “we are not perhaps in
                exactly the same camp. Your judgment is more philosophical. You are a man of few
                words, but I haven’t met anybody who dared to doubt the generosity of your
                sentiments. There is a solidity about your character which cannot exist without
                courage.”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt flattered and began to murmur shyly something about being very glad of
                his good opinion, when Haldin raised his hand.</p>

            <p>“That is what I was saying to myself,” he continued, “as I dodged in the woodyard
                down by the river-side. ‘He has a strong character this young man,’ I said to
                myself. ‘He does not throw his soul to the winds.’ Your reserve has always
                fascinated me, Kirylo Sidorovitch. So I tried to remember your address. But look
                here — it was a piece of luck. Your dvornik was away from the gate talking to a
                sleigh-driver on the other side of the street. I met no one on the stairs, not a
                soul. As I came up to your floor I caught sight of your landlady coming out of your
                rooms. But she did not see me. She crossed the landing to her own side, and then I
                slipped in. I have been here two hours expecting you to come in every moment.”</p>

            <p>Razumov had listened in astonishment; but before he could open his mouth Haldin
                added, speaking deliberately,” It was I who removed de P—— this morning.” Razumov
                kept down a cry of dismay. The sentiment of his life being utterly ruined by this
                contact with such a crime expressed itself quaintly by a sort of half- derisive
                mental exclamation, “There goes my silver medal!”</p>

            <p>Haldin continued after waiting a while —</p>

            <p>“You say nothing, Kirylo Sidorovitch! I understand your silence. To be sure, I cannot
                expect you with your frigid English manner to embrace me. But never mind your
                manners. You have enough heart to have heard the sound of weeping and gnashing of
                teeth this man raised in the land. That would be enough to get over any
                philosophical hopes. He was uprooting the tender plant. He had to be stopped. He was
                a dangerous man — a convinced man. Three more years of his work would have put us
                back fifty years into bondage — and look at all the lives wasted, at all the souls
                lost in that time.”</p>

            <p>His curt, self-confident voice suddenly lost its ring and it was in a dull tone that
                he added, “Yes, brother, I have killed him. It’s weary work.”</p>

            <p>Razumov had sunk into a chair. Every moment he expected a crowd of policemen to rush
                in. There must have been thousands of them out looking for that man walking up and
                down in his room. Haldin was talking again in a restrained, steady voice. Now and
                then he flourished an arm, slowly, without excitement.</p>

            <p>He told Razumov how he had brooded for a year; how he had not slept properly for
                weeks. He and “Another “ had a warning of the Minister’s movements from “a certain
                person” late the evening before. He and that “Another” prepared their “engines” and
                resolved to have no sleep till “the deed” was done. They walked the streets under
                the falling snow with the “engines” on them, exchanging not a word the livelong
                night. When they happened to meet a police patrol they took each other by the arm
                and pretended to be a couple of peasants on the spree. They reeled and talked in
                drunken hoarse voices. Except for these strange outbreaks they kept silence, moving
                on ceaselessly. Their plans had been previously arranged. At daybreak they made
                their way to the spot which they knew the sledge must pass. When it appeared in
                sight they exchanged a muttered good-bye and separated. The “other” remained at the
                corner, Haldin took up a position a little farther up the street . . . .</p>

            <p>After throwing his “engine” he ran off and in a moment was overtaken by the
                panic-struck people flying away from the spot after the second explosion. They were
                wild with terror. He was jostled once or twice. He slowed down for the rush to pass
                him and then turned to the left into a narrow street. There he was alone.</p>

            <p>He marvelled at this immediate escape. The work was done. He could hardly believe it.
                He fought with an almost irresistible longing to lie down on the pavement and sleep.
                But this sort of faintness — a drowsy faintness — passed off quickly. He walked
                faster, making his way to one of the poorer parts of the town in order to look up
                Ziemianitch.</p>

            <p>This Ziemianitch, Razumov understood, was a sort of town-peasant who had got on;
                owner of a small number of sledges and horses for hire. Haldin paused in his
                narrative to exclaim —</p>

            <p>“A bright spirit! A hardy soul! The best driver in St. Petersburg. He has a team of
                three horses there. . . . Ah! He’s a fellow!”</p>

            <p>This man had declared himself willing to take out safely, at any time, one or two
                persons to the second or third railway station on one of the southern lines. But
                there had been no time to warn him the night before. His usual haunt seemed to be a
                low-class eating-house on the outskirts of the town. When Haldin got there the man
                was not to be found. He was not expected to turn up again till the evening. Haldin
                wandered away restlessly.</p>

            <p>He saw the gate of a woodyard open and went in to get out of the wind which swept the
                bleak broad thoroughfare. The great rectangular piles of cut wood loaded with snow
                resembled the huts of a village. At first the watchman who discovered him crouching
                amongst them talked in a friendly manner. He was a dried-up old man wearing two
                ragged army coats one over the other; his wizened little face, tied up under the jaw
                and over the ears in a dirty red handkerchief, looked comical. Presently he grew
                sulky, and then all at once without rhyme or reason began to shout furiously.</p>

            <p>“Aren’t you ever going to clear out of this, you loafer? We know all about factory
                hands of your sort. A big, strong, young chap! You aren’t even drunk. What do you
                want here? You don’t frighten us. Take yourself and your ugly eyes away.”</p>

            <p>Haldin stopped before the sitting Razumov. His supple figure, with the white forehead
                above which the fair hair stood straight up, had an aspect of lofty daring.</p>

            <p>“He did not like my eyes,” he said. “And so. . .here I am.”</p>

            <p>Razumov made an effort to speak calmly.</p>

            <p>“But pardon me, Victor Victorovitch. We know each other so little. . . . I don’t see
                why you. . .”</p>

            <p>“Confidence,” said Haldin.</p>

            <p>This word sealed Razumov’s lips as if a hand had been clapped on his mouth. His brain
                seethed with arguments</p>

            <p>“And so — here you are,” he muttered through his teeth.</p>

            <p>The other did not detect the tone of anger. Never suspected it.</p>

            <p>“Yes. And nobody knows I am here. You are the last person that could be suspected —
                should I get caught. That’s an advantage, you see. And then — speaking to a superior
                mind like yours I can well say all the truth. It occurred to me that you — you have
                no one belonging to you — no ties, no one to suffer for it if this came out by some
                means. There have been enough ruined Russian homes as it is. But I don’t see how my
                passage through your rooms can be ever known. If I should be got hold of, I’ll know
                how to keep silent — no matter what they may be pleased to do to me,” he added
                grimly.</p>

            <p>He began to walk again while Razumov sat still appalled.</p>

            <p>“You thought that —” he faltered out almost sick with indignation.</p>

            <p>“Yes, Razumov. Yes, brother. Some day you shall help to build. You suppose that I am
                a terrorist, now — a destructor of what is, But consider that the true destroyers
                are they who destroy the spirit of progress and truth, not the avengers who merely
                kill the bodies of the persecutors of human dignity. Men like me are necessary to
                make room for self-contained, thinking men like you. Well, we have made the
                sacrifice of our lives, but all the same I want to escape if it can be done. It is
                not my life I want to save, but my power to do. I won’t live idle. Oh no! Don’t make
                any mistake, Razumov. Men like me are rare. And, besides, an example like this is
                more awful to oppressors when the perpetrator vanishes without a trace. They sit in
                their offices and palaces and quake. All I want you to do is to help me to vanish.
                No great matter that. Only to go by and by and see Ziemianitch for me at that place
                where I went this morning. Just tell him, ‘He whom you know wants a well-horsed
                sledge to pull up half an hour after midnight at the seventh lamp-post on the left
                counting from the upper end of Karabelnaya. If nobody gets in, the sledge is to run
                round a block or two, so as to come back past the same spot in ten minutes’ time.’
                ”</p>

            <p>Razumov wondered why he had not cut short that talk and told this man to go away long
                before. Was it weakness or what?</p>

            <p>He concluded that it was a sound instinct. Haldin must have been seen. It was
                impossible that some people should not have noticed the face and appearance of the
                man who threw the second bomb. Haldin was a noticeable person. The police in their
                thousands must have had his description within the hour. With every moment the
                danger grew. Sent out to wander in the streets he could not escape being caught in
                the end.</p>

            <p>The police would very soon find out all about him. They would set about discovering a
                conspiracy. Everybody Haldin had ever known would be in the greatest danger.
                Unguarded expressions, little facts in themselves innocent would be counted for
                crimes. Razumov remembered certain words he said, the speeches he had listened to,
                the harmless gatherings he had attended — it was almost impossible for a student to
                keep out of that sort of thing, without becoming suspect to his comrades.</p>

            <p>Razumov saw himself shut up in a fortress, worried, badgered, perhaps ill-used. He
                saw himself deported by an administrative order, his life broken, ruined, and robbed
                of all hope. He saw himself — at best — leading a miserable existence under police
                supervision, in some small, faraway provincial town, without friends to assist his
                necessities or even take any steps to alleviate his lot — as others had. Others had
                fathers, mothers, brothers, relations, connexions, to move heaven and earth on their
                behalf — he had no one. The very officials that sentenced him some morning would
                forget his existence before sunset.</p>

            <p>He saw his youth pass away from him in misery and half starvation — his strength give
                way, his mind become an abject thing. He saw himself creeping, broken down and
                shabby, about the streets — dying unattended in some filthy hole of a room, or on
                the sordid bed of a Government hospital.</p>

            <p>He shuddered. Then the peace of bitter calmness came over him. It was best to keep
                this man out of the streets till he could be got rid of with some chance of
                escaping. That was the best that could be done. Razumov, of course, felt the safety
                of his lonely existence to be permanently endangered. This evening’s doings could
                turn up against him at any time as long as this man lived and the present
                institutions endured. They appeared to him rational and indestructible at that
                moment. They had a force of harmony — in contrast with the horrible discord of this
                man’s presence. He hated the man. He said quietly —</p>

            <p>“Yes, of course, I will go. ‘You must give me precise directions, and for the rest —
                depend on me.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! You are a fellow! Collected — cool as a cucumber. A regular Englishman. Where
                did you get your soul from? There aren’t many like you. Look here, brother! Men like
                me leave no posterity, but their souls are not lost. No man’s soul is ever lost. It
                works for itself — or else where would be the sense of self- sacrifice, of
                martyrdom, of conviction, of faith- -the labours of the soul? What will become of my
                soul when I die in the way I must die — soon — very soon perhaps? It shall not
                perish. Don’t make a mistake, Razumov. This is not murder — it is war, war. My
                spirit shall go on warring in some Russian body till all falsehood is swept out of
                the world. The modern civilization is false, but a new revelation shall come out of
                Russia. Ha! you say nothing. You are a sceptic. I respect your philosophical
                scepticism, Razumov, but don’t touch the soul. The Russian soul that lives in all of
                us. It has a future. It has a mission, I tell you, or else why should I have been
                moved to do this — reckless — like a butcher — in the middle of all these innocent
                people — scattering death — I! I! . . . I wouldn’t hurt a fly!”</p>

            <p>“Not so loud,” warned Razumov harshly.</p>

            <p>Haldin sat down abruptly, and leaning his head on his folded arms burst into tears.
                He wept for a long time. The dusk had deepened in the room. Razumov, motionless in
                sombre wonder, listened to the sobs.</p>

            <p>The other raised his head, got up and with an effort mastered his voice.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Men like me leave no posterity,” he repeated in a subdued tone.” I have a
                sister though. She’s with my old mother — I persuaded them to go abroad this year —
                thank God. Not a bad little girl my sister. She has the most trustful eyes of any
                human being that ever walked this earth. She will marry well, I hope. She may have
                children — sons perhaps. Look at me. My father was a Government official in the
                provinces, He had a little land too. A simple servant of God — a true Russian in his
                way. His was the soul of obedience. But I am not like him. They say I resemble my
                mother’s eldest brother, an officer. They shot him in ‘28. Under Nicholas, you know.
                Haven’t I told you that this is war, war. . . . But God of Justice! This is weary
                work.”</p>

            <p>Razumov, in his chair, leaning his head on his hand, spoke as if from the bottom of
                an abyss.</p>

            <p>“You believe in God, Haldin? ”</p>

            <p>“There you go catching at words that are wrung from one. What does it matter? What
                was it the Englishman said: ‘There is a divine soul in things. . .’ Devil take him —
                I don’t remember now. But he spoke the truth. When the day of you thinkers comes
                don’t you forget what’s divine in the Russian soul — and that’s resignation. Respect
                that in your intellectual restlessness and don’t let your arrogant wisdom spoil its
                message to the world. I am speaking to you now like a man with a rope round his
                neck. What do you imagine I am? A being in revolt? No. It’s you thinkers who are in
                everlasting revolt. I am one of the resigned. When the necessity of this heavy work
                came to me and I understood that it had to be done — what did I do? Did I exult? Did
                I take pride in my purpose? Did I try to weigh its worth and consequences? No! I was
                resigned. I thought ‘God’s will be done.’”</p>

            <p>He threw himself full length on Razumov’s bed and putting the backs of his hands over
                his eyes remained perfectly motionless and silent. Not even the sound of his
                breathing could be heard. The dead stillness or the room remained undisturbed till
                in the darkness Razumov said gloomily —</p>

            <p>“Haldin.”</p>

            <p>“Yes,” answered the other readily, quite invisible now on the bed and without the
                slightest stir.</p>

            <p>“Isn’t it time for me to start?”</p>

            <p>“Yes, brother.” The other was heard, lying still in the darkness as though he were
                talking in his sleep. “The time has come to put fate to the test.”</p>

            <p>He paused, then gave a few lucid directions in the quiet impersonal voice of a man in
                a trance. Razumov made ready without a word of answer. As he was leaving the room
                the voice on the bed said after him —</p>

            <p>“Go with God, thou silent soul.”</p>

            <p>On the landing, moving softly, Razumov locked the door and put the key in his
                pocket.</p>

            <head>2</head>


            <p>The words and events of that evening must have been graven as if with a steel tool on
                Mr. Razumov’s brain since he was able to write his relation with such fullness and
                precision a good many months afterwards.</p>

            <p>The record of the thoughts which assailed him in the street is even more minute and
                abundant. They seem to have rushed upon him with the greater freedom because his
                thinking powers were no longer crushed by Haldin’s presence — the appalling presence
                of a great crime and the stunning force of a great fanaticism. On looking through
                the pages of Mr. Razumov’s diary I own that a “rush of thoughts” is not an adequate
                image.</p>

            <p>The more adequate description would be a tumult of thoughts — the faithful reflection
                of the state of his feelings. The thoughts in themselves were not numerous — they
                were like the thoughts of most human beings, few and simple — but they cannot be
                reproduced here in all their exclamatory repetitions which went on in an endless and
                weary turmoil — for the walk was long.</p>

            <p>If to the Western reader they appear shocking, inappropriate, or even improper, it
                must be remembered that as to the first this may be the effect of my crude
                statement. For the rest I will only remark here that this is not a story of the West
                of Europe.</p>

            <p>Nations it may be have fashioned their Governments, but the Governments have paid
                them back in the same coin. It is unthinkable that any young Englishman should find
                himself in Razumov’s situation. This being so it would be a vain enterprise to
                imagine what he would think. The only safe surmise to make is that he would not
                think as Mr. Razumov thought at this crisis of his fate. He would not have an
                hereditary and personal knowledge or the means by which historical autocracy
                represses ideas, guards its power, and defends its existence. By an act of mental
                extravagance he might imagine himself arbitrarily thrown into prison, but it would
                never occur to him unless he were delirious (and perhaps not even then) that he
                could be beaten with whips as a practical measure either of investigation or of
                punishment.</p>

            <p>This is but a crude and obvious example of the different conditions of Western
                thought. I don’t know that this danger occurred, specially, to Mr. Razumov. No doubt
                it entered unconsciously into the general dread and the general appallingness of
                this crisis. Razumov, as has been seen, was aware of more subtle ways in which an
                individual may be undone by the proceedings of a despotic Government. A simple
                expulsion from the University (the very least that could happen to him), with an
                impossibility to continue his studies anywhere, was enough to ruin utterly a young
                man depending entirely upon the development of his natural abilities for his place
                in the world. He was a Russian: and for him to be implicated meant simply sinking
                into the lowest social depths amongst the hopeless and the destitute — the night
                birds of the city.</p>

            <p>The peculiar circumstances of Razumov’s parentage, or rather of his lack of
                parentage, should be taken into the account of his thoughts. And he remembered them
                too. He had been lately reminded of them in a peculiarly atrocious way by this fatal
                Haldin. “Because I haven’t that, must everything else be taken away from me?” he
                thought.</p>

            <p>He nerved himself for another effort to go on. Along the roadway sledges glided
                phantom-like and jingling through a fluttering whiteness on the black face of the
                night. “For it is a crime,” he was saying to himself. “A murder is a murder. Though,
                of course, some sort of liberal institutions . . . .”</p>

            <p>A feeling of horrible sickness came over him. “I must be courageous,” he exhorted
                himself mentally. All his strength was suddenly gone as if taken out by a hand. Then
                by a mighty effort of will it came back because he was afraid of fainting in the
                street and being picked up by the police with the key of his lodgings in his pocket.
                They would find Haldin there, and then, indeed, he would be undone.</p>

            <p>Strangely enough it was this fear which seems to have kept him up to the end. The
                passers-by were rare. They came upon him suddenly, looming up black in the
                snowflakes close by, then vanishing all at once-without footfalls.</p>

            <p>It was the quarter of the very poor. Razumov noticed an elderly woman tied up in
                ragged shawls. Under the street lamp she seemed a beggar off duty. She walked
                leisurely in the blizzard as though she had no home to hurry to, she hugged under
                one arm a round loaf of black bread with an air of guarding a priceless booty: and
                Razumov averting his glance envied her the peace of her mind and the serenity of her
                fate.</p>

            <p>To one reading Mr. Razumov’s narrative it is really a wonder how he managed to keep
                going as he did along one interminable street after another on pavements that were
                gradually becoming blocked with snow. It was the thought of Haldin locked up in his
                rooms and the desperate desire to get rid of his presence which drove him forward.
                No rational determination had any part in his exertions. Thus, when on arriving at
                the low eating-house he heard that the man of horses, Ziemianitch, was not there, he
                could only stare stupidly.</p>

            <p>The waiter, a wild-haired youth in tarred boots and a pink shirt, exclaimed,
                uncovering his pale gums in a silly grin, that Ziemianitch had got his skinful early
                in the afternoon and had gone away with a bottle under each arm to keep it up
                amongst the horses — he supposed.</p>

            <p>The owner of the vile den, a bony short man in a dirty cloth caftan coming down to
                his heels, stood by, his hands tucked into his belt, and nodded confirmation.</p>

            <p>The reek of spirits, the greasy rancid steam of food got Razumov by the throat. He
                struck a table with his clenched hand and shouted violently —</p>

            <p>“You lie.”</p>

            <p>Bleary unwashed faces were turned to his direction. A mild-eyed ragged tramp drinking
                tea at the next table moved farther away. A murmur of wonder arose with an undertone
                of uneasiness. A laugh was heard too, and an exclamation, “There! there!” jeeringly
                soothing. The waiter looked all round and announced to the room —</p>

            <p>“The gentleman won’t believe that Ziemianitch is drunk.”</p>

            <p>From a distant corner a hoarse voice belonging to a horrible, nondescript, shaggy
                being with a black face like the muzzle of a bear grunted angrily —</p>

            <p>“The cursed driver of thieves. What do we want with his gentlemen here? We are all
                honest folk in this place.”</p>

            <p>Razumov, biting his lip till blood came to keep himself from bursting into
                imprecations, followed the owner of the den, who, whispering “Come along, little
                father,” led him into a tiny hole of a place behind the wooden counter, whence
                proceeded a sound of splashing. A wet and bedraggled creature, a sort of sexless and
                shivering scarecrow, washed glasses in there, bending over a wooden tub by the light
                of a tallow dip.</p>

            <p>“Yes, little father,” the man in the long caftan said plaintively. He had a brown,
                cunning little face, a thin greyish beard. Trying to light a tin lantern he hugged
                it to his breast and talked garrulously the while.</p>

            <p>He would show Ziemianitch to the gentleman to prove there were no lies told. And he
                would show him drunk. His woman, it seems, ran away from him last night. “Such a hag
                she was! Thin! Pfui!” He spat. They were always running away from that driver of the
                devil — and he sixty years old too; could never get used to it. But each heart knows
                sorrow after its own kind and Ziemianitch was a born fool all his days. And then he
                would fly to the bottle. “‘Who could bear life in our land without the bottle?’ he
                says. A proper Russian man — the little pig. . . . Be pleased to follow me.”</p>

            <p>Razumov crossed a quadrangle of deep snow enclosed between high walls with
                innumerable windows. Here and there a dim yellow light hung within the four-square
                mass of darkness. The house was an enormous slum, a hive of human vermin, a
                monumental abode of misery towering on the verge of starvation and despair.</p>

            <p>In a corner the ground sloped sharply down, and Razumov followed the light of the
                lantern through a small doorway into a long cavernous place like a neglected
                subterranean byre. Deep within, three shaggy little horses tied up to rings hung
                their heads together, motionless and shadowy in the dim light of the lantern. It
                must have been the famous team of Haldin’s escape. Razumov peered fearfully into the
                gloom. His guide pawed in the straw with his foot.</p>

            <p>“Here he is. Ah! the little pigeon. A true Russian man. ‘No heavy hearts for me,’ he
                says. ‘Bring out the bottle and take your ugly mug out of my sight.’ Ha! ha! ha!
                That’s the fellow he is.”</p>

            <p>He held the lantern over a prone form of a man, apparently fully dressed for
                outdoors. His head was lost in a pointed cloth hood. On the other side of a heap of
                straw protruded a pair of feet in monstrous thick boots.</p>

            <p>“Always ready to drive,” commented the keeper of the eating-house. “A proper Russian
                driver that. Saint or devil, night or day is all one to Ziemianitch when his heart
                is free from sorrow. ‘I don’t ask who you are, but where you want to go,’ he says.
                He would drive Satan himself to his own abode and come back chirruping to his
                horses. Many a one he has driven who is clanking his chains in the Nertchinsk mines
                by this time.”</p>

            <p>Razumov shuddered.</p>

            <p>“Call him, wake him up,” he faltered out.</p>

            <p>The other set down his light, stepped back and launched a kick at the prostrate
                sleeper. The man shook at the impact but did not move. At the third kick he grunted
                but remained inert as before.</p>

            <p>The eating-house keeper desisted and fetched a deep sigh.</p>

            <p>“You see for yourself how it is. We have done what we can for you.”</p>

            <p>He picked up the lantern. The intense black spokes of shadow swung about in the
                circle of light. A terrible fury — the blind rage of self- preservation — possessed
                Razumov.</p>

            <p>“Ah! The vile beast,” he bellowed out in an unearthly tone which made the lantern
                jump and tremble! “I shall wake you! Give me. . .give me. . .”</p>

            <p>He looked round wildly, seized the handle of a stablefork and rushing forward struck
                at the prostrate body with inarticulate cries. After a time his cries ceased, and
                the rain of blows fell in the stillness and shadows of the cellar- like stable.
                Razumov belaboured Ziemianitch with an insatiable fury, in great volleys of sounding
                thwacks. Except for the violent movements of Razumov nothing stirred, neither the
                beaten man nor the spoke-like shadows on the walls. And only the sound of blows was
                heard. It was a weird scene.</p>

            <p>Suddenly there was a sharp crack. The stick broke and half of it flew far away into
                the gloom beyond the light. At the same time Ziemianitch sat up. At this Razumov
                became as motionless as the man with the lantern — only his breast heaved for air as
                if ready to burst.</p>

            <p>Some dull sensation of pain must have penetrated at last the consoling night of
                drunkenness enwrapping the “bright Russian soul” of Haldin’s enthusiastic praise.
                But Ziemianitch evidently saw nothing. His eyeballs blinked all white in the light
                once, twice — then the gleam went out. For a moment he sat in the straw with closed
                eyes with a strange air of weary meditation, then fell over slowly on his side
                without making the slightest sound. Only the straw rustled a little. Razumov stared
                wildly, fighting for his breath. After a second or two he heard a light snore.</p>

            <p>He flung from him the piece of stick remaining in his grasp, and went off with great
                hasty strides without looking back once.</p>

            <p>After going heedlessly for some fifty yards along the street he walked into a
                snowdrift and was up to his knees before he stopped.</p>

            <p>This recalled him to himself; and glancing about he discovered he had been going in
                the wrong direction. He retraced his steps, but now at a more moderate pace. When
                passing before the house he had just left he flourished his fist at the sombre
                refuge of misery and crime rearing its sinister bulk on the white ground. It had an
                air of brooding. He let his arm fall by his side — discouraged.</p>

            <p>Ziemianitch’s passionate surrender to sorrow and consolation had baffled him. That
                was the people. A true Russian man! Razumov was glad he had beaten that brute — the
                “bright soul” of the other. Here they were: the people and the enthusiast.</p>

            <p>Between the two he was done for. Between the drunkenness of the peasant incapable of
                action and the dream-intoxication of the idealist incapable of perceiving the reason
                of things, and the true character of men. It was a sort of terrible childishness.
                But children had their masters. “Ah! the stick, the stick, the stern hand,” thought
                Razumov, longing for power to hurt and destroy.</p>

            <p>He was glad he had thrashed that brute. The physical exertion had left his body in a
                comfortable glow. His mental agitation too was clarified as if all the feverishness
                had gone out of him in a fit of outward violence. Together with the persisting sense
                of terrible danger he was conscious now of a tranquil, unquenchable hate.</p>

            <p>He walked slower and slower. And indeed, considering the guest he had in his rooms,
                it was no wonder he lingered on the way. It was like harbouring a pestilential
                disease that would not perhaps take your life, but would take from you all that made
                life worth living — a subtle pest that would convert earth into a hell.</p>

            <p>What was he doing now? Lying on the bed as if dead, with the back of his hands over
                his eyes? Razumov had a morbidly vivid vision of Haldin on his bed — the white
                pillow hollowed by the head, the legs in long boots, the upturned feet. And in his
                abhorrence he said to himself, “I’ll kill him when I get home.” But he knew very
                well that that was of no use. The corpse hanging round his neck would be nearly as
                fatal as the living man. Nothing short of complete annihilation would do. And that
                was impossible. What then? Must one kill oneself to escape this visitation?</p>

            <p>Razumov’s despair was too profoundly tinged with hate to accept that issue.</p>

            <p>And yet it was despair — nothing less — at the thought of having to live with Haldin
                for an indefinite number of days in mortal alarm at every sound. But perhaps when he
                heard that this “bright soul” of Ziemianitch suffered from a drunken eclipse the
                fellow would take his infernal resignation somewhere else. And that was not likely
                on the face of it.</p>

            <p>Razumov thought: “I am being crushed — and I can’t even run away.” Other men had
                somewhere a corner of the earth — some little house in the provinces where they had
                a right to take their troubles. A material refuge. He had nothing. He had not even a
                moral refuge — the refuge of confidence. To whom could he go with this tale — in all
                this great, great land?</p>

            <p>Razumov stamped his foot — and under the soft carpet of snow felt the hard ground of
                Russia, inanimate, cold, inert, like a sullen and tragic mother hiding her face
                under a winding-sheet — his native soil! — his very own — without a fireside,
                without a heart!</p>

            <p>He cast his eyes upwards and stood amazed. The snow had ceased to fall, and now, as
                if by a miracle, he saw above his head the clear black sky of the northern winter,
                decorated with the sumptuous fires of the stars. It was a canopy fit for the
                resplendent purity of the snows.</p>

            <p>Razumov received an almost physical impression of endless space and of countless
                millions.</p>

            <p>He responded to it with the readiness of a Russian who is born to an inheritance of
                space and numbers. Under the sumptuous immensity of the sky, the snow covered the
                endless forests, the frozen rivers, the plains of an immense country, obliterating
                the landmarks, the accidents of the ground, levelling everything under its uniform
                whiteness, like a monstrous blank page awaiting the record of an inconceivable
                history. It covered the passive land with its lives of countless people like
                Ziemianitch and its handful of agitators like this Haldin — murdering foolishly.</p>

            <p>It was a sort of sacred inertia. Razumov felt a respect for it. A voice seemed to cry
                within him, “Don’t touch it.” It was a guarantee of duration, of safety, while the
                travail of maturing destiny went on — a work not of revolutions with their
                passionate levity of action and their shifting impulses — but of peace. What it
                needed was not the conflicting aspirations of a people, but a will strong and one:
                it wanted not the babble of many voices, but a man — strong and one!</p>

            <p>Razumov stood on the point of conversion. He was fascinated by its approach, by its
                overpowering logic. For a train of thought is never false. The falsehood lies deep
                in the necessities of existence, in secret fears and half-formed ambitions, in the
                secret confidence combined with a secret mistrust of ourselves, in the love of hope
                and the dread of uncertain days.</p>

            <p>In Russia, the land of spectral ideas and disembodied aspirations, many brave minds
                have turned away at last from the vain and endless conflict to the one great
                historical fact of the land. They turned to autocracy for the peace of their
                patriotic conscience as a weary unbeliever, touched by grace, turns to the faith of
                his fathers for the blessing of spiritual rest. Like other Russians before him,
                Razumov, in conflict with himself, felt the touch of grace upon his forehead.</p>

            <p>“Haldin means disruption,” he thought to himself, beginning to walk again. “ What is
                he with his indignation, with his talk of bondage — with his talk of God’s justice?
                All that means disruption. Better that thousands should suffer than that a people
                should become a disintegrated mass, helpless like dust in the wind. Obscurantism is
                better than the light of incendiary torches. The seed germinates in the night. Out
                of the dark soil springs the perfect plant. But a volcanic eruption is sterile, the
                ruin of the fertile ground. And am I, who love my country — who have nothing but
                that to love and put my faith in — am I to have my future, perhaps my usefulness,
                ruined by this sanguinary fanatic?”</p>

            <p>The grace entered into Razumov. He believed now in the man who would come at the
                appointed time.</p>

            <p>What is a throne? A few pieces of wood upholstered in velvet. But a throne is a seat
                of power too. The form of government is the shape of a tool — an instrument. But
                twenty thousand bladders inflated by the noblest sentiments and jostling against
                each other in the air are a miserable incumbrance of space, holding no power,
                possessing no will, having nothing to give.</p>

            <p>He went on thus, heedless of the way, holding a discourse with himself with
                extraordinary abundance and facility. Generally his phrases came to him slowly,
                after a conscious and painstaking wooing. Some superior power had inspired him with
                a flow of masterly argument as certain converted sinners become overwhelmingly
                loquacious.</p>

            <p>He felt an austere exultation.</p>

            <p>“What are the luridly smoky lucubrations of that fellow to the clear grasp of my
                intellect?” he thought. “Is not this my country? Have I not got forty million
                brothers?” he asked himself, unanswerably victorious in the silence of his breast.
                And the fearful thrashing he had given the inanimate Ziemianitch seemed to him a
                sign of intimate union, a pathetically severe necessity of brotherly love. “No! If I
                must suffer let me at least suffer for my convictions, not for a crime my reason —
                my cool superior reason — rejects.”</p>

            <p>He ceased to think for a moment. The silence in his breast was complete. But he felt
                a suspicious uneasiness, such as we may experience when we enter an unlighted
                strange place — the irrational feeling that something may jump upon us in the dark —
                the absurd dread of the unseen.</p>

            <p>Of course he was far from being a moss-grown reactionary. Everything was not for the
                best. Despotic bureaucracy . . . abuses . . . corruption . . . and so on. Capable
                men were wanted. Enlightened intelligences. Devoted hearts. But absolute power
                should be preserved — the tool ready for the man — for the great autocrat of the
                future. Razumov believed in him. The logic of history made him unavoidable. The
                state of the people demanded him, “What else?” he asked himself ardently, “could
                move all that mass in one direction? Nothing could. Nothing but a single will.”</p>

            <p>He was persuaded that he was sacrificing his personal longings of liberalism —
                rejecting the attractive error for the stern Russian truth. “That’s patriotism,” he
                observed mentally, and added, “There’s no stopping midway on that road,” and then
                remarked to himself, “I am not a coward.”</p>

            <p>And again there was a dead silence in Razumov’s breast. He walked with lowered head,
                making room for no one. He walked slowly and his thoughts returning spoke within him
                with solemn slowness.</p>

            <p>“What is this Haldin? And what am I? Only two grains of sand. But a great mountain is
                made up of just such insignificant grains. And the death of a man or of many men is
                an insignificant thing. Yet we combat a contagious pestilence. Do I want his death?
                No! I would save him if I could — but no one can do that — he is the withered member
                which must be cut off. If I must perish through him, let me at least not perish with
                him, and associated against my will with his sombre folly that understands nothing
                either of men or things. Why should I leave a false memory?”</p>

            <p>It passed through his mind that there was no one in the world who cared what sort of
                memory he left behind him. He exclaimed to himself instantly, “Perish vainly for a
                falsehood! . . . What a miserable fate!”</p>

            <p>He was now in a more animated part of the town. He did not remark the crash of two
                colliding sledges close to the curb. The driver of one bellowed tearfully at his
                fellow-</p>

            <p>“Oh, thou vile wretch!”</p>

            <p>This hoarse yell, let out nearly in his ear, disturbed Razumov. He shook his head
                impatiently and went on looking straight before him. Suddenly on the snow, stretched
                on his back right across his path, he saw Haldin, solid, distinct, real, with his
                inverted hands over his eyes, clad in a brown close-fitting coat and long boots. He
                was lying out of the way a little, as though he had selected that place on purpose.
                The snow round him was untrodden.</p>

            <p>This hallucination had such a solidity of aspect that the first movement of Razumov
                was to reach for his pocket to assure himself that the key of his rooms was there.
                But he checked the impulse with a disdainful curve of his lips. He understood. His
                thought, concentrated intensely on the figure left lying on his bed, had culminated
                in this extraordinary illusion of the sight. Razumov tackled the phenomenon calmly.
                With a stern face, without a check and gazing far beyond the vision, he walked on,
                experiencing nothing but a slight tightening of the chest. After passing he turned
                his head for a glance, and saw only the unbroken track of his footsteps over the
                place where the breast of the phantom had been lying.</p>

            <p>Razumov walked on and after a little time whispered his wonder to himself.</p>

            <p>“Exactly as if alive! Seemed to breathe! And right in my way too! I have had an
                extraordinary experience.”</p>

            <p>He made a few steps and muttered through his set teeth —</p>

            <p>“I shall give him up.”</p>

            <p>Then for some twenty yards or more all was blank. He wrapped his cloak closer round
                him. He pulled his cap well forward over his eyes.</p>

            <p>“Betray. A great word. What is betrayal? They talk of a man betraying his country,
                his friends, his sweetheart. There must be a moral bond first. All a man can betray
                is his conscience. And how is my conscience engaged here; by what bond of common
                faith, of common conviction, am I obliged to let that fanatical idiot drag me down
                with him? On the contrary — every obligation of true courage is the other way.”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked round from under his cap.</p>

            <p>“What can the prejudice of the world reproach me with? Have I provoked his
                confidence? No! Have I by a single word, look, or gesture given him reason to
                suppose that I accepted his trust in me? No! It is true that I consented to go and
                see his Ziemianitch. Well, I have been to see him. And I broke a stick on his back
                too — the brute.”</p>

            <p>Something seemed to turn over in his head bringing uppermost a singularly hard, clear
                facet of his brain.</p>

            <p>“It would be better, however,” he reflected with a quite different mental accent, “to
                keep that circumstance altogether to myself.”</p>

            <p>He had passed beyond the turn leading to his lodgings, and had reached a wide and
                fashionable street. Some shops were still open, and all the restaurants. Lights fell
                on the pavement where men in expensive fur coats, with here and there the elegant
                figure of a woman, walked with an air of leisure. Razumov looked at them with the
                contempt of an austere believer for the frivolous crowd. It was the world — those
                officers, dignitaries, men of fashion, officials, members of the Yacht Club. The
                event of the morning affected them all. What would they say if they knew what this
                student in a cloak was going to do?</p>

            <p>“Not one of them is capable of feeling and thinking as deeply as I can. How many of
                them could accomplish an act of conscience?”</p>

            <p>Razumov lingered in the well-lighted street. He was firmly decided. Indeed, it could
                hardly be called a decision. He had simply discovered what he had meant to do all
                along. And yet he felt the need of some other mind’s sanction.</p>

            <p>With something resembling anguish he said to himself —</p>

            <p>“I want to be understood.” The universal aspiration with all its profound and
                melancholy meaning assailed heavily Razumov, who, amongst eighty millions of his
                kith and kin, had no heart to which he could open himself.</p>

            <p>The attorney was not to be thought of. He despised the little agent of chicane too
                much. One could not go and lay one’s conscience before the policeman at the corner.
                Neither was Razumov anxious to go to the chief of his district’s police — a
                common-looking person whom he used to see sometimes in the street in a shabby
                uniform and with a smouldering cigarette stuck to his lower lip. “He would begin by
                locking me up most probably. At any rate, he is certain to get excited and create an
                awful commotion,” thought Razumov practically</p>

            <p>An act of conscience must be done with outward dignity.</p>

            <p>Razumov longed desperately for a word of advice, for moral support. Who knows what
                true loneliness is — not the conventional word, but the naked terror? To the lonely
                themselves it wears a mask. The most miserable outcast hugs some memory or some
                illusion. Now and then a fatal conjunction of events may lift the veil for an
                instant. For an instant only. No human being could bear a steady view of moral
                solitude without going mad.</p>

            <p>Razumov had reached that point of vision. To escape from it he embraced for a whole
                minute the delirious purpose of rushing to his lodgings and flinging himself on his
                knees by the side of the bed with the dark figure stretched on it; to pour out a
                full confession in passionate words that would stir the whole being of that man to
                its innermost depths; that would end in embraces and tears; in an incredible
                fellowship of souls — such as the world had never seen. It was sublime!</p>

            <p>Inwardly he wept and trembled already. But to the casual eyes that were cast upon him
                he was aware that he appeared as a tranquil student in a cloak, out for a leisurely
                stroll. He noted, too, the sidelong, brilliant glance of a pretty woman — with a
                delicate head, and covered in the hairy skins of wild beasts down to her feet, like
                a frail and beautiful savage — which rested for a moment with a sort of mocking
                tenderness on the deep abstraction of that good-looking young man.</p>

            <p>Suddenly Razumov stood still. The glimpse of a passing grey whisker, caught and lost
                in the same instant, had evoked the complete image of Prince K— — the man who once
                had pressed his hand as no other man had pressed it — a faint but lingering pressure
                like a secret sign, like a half-unwilling caress.</p>

            <p>And Razumov marvelled at himself. Why did he not think of him before!</p>

            <p>“A senator, a dignitary, a great personage, the very man — He!”</p>

            <p>A strange softening emotion came over Razumov — made his knees shake a little. He
                repressed it with a new-born austerity. All that sentiment was pernicious nonsense.
                He couldn’t be quick enough; and when he got into a sledge he shouted to the
                driver —</p>

            <p>“To the K—— Palace. Get on — you! Fly!” The startled moujik, bearded up to the very
                whites of his eyes, answered obsequiously —</p>

            <p>“I hear, your high Nobility.”</p>

            <p>It was lucky for Razumov that Prince K—— was not a man of timid character. On the day
                of Mr. de P——‘s murder an extreme alarm and despondency prevailed in the high
                official spheres.</p>

            <p>Prince K— — sitting sadly alone in his study, was told by his alarmed servants that a
                mysterious young man had forced his way into the hall, refused to tell his name and
                the nature of his business, and would not move from there till he had seen his
                Excellency in private. Instead of locking himself up and telephoning for the police,
                as nine out of ten high personages would have done that evening, the Prince gave way
                to curiosity and came quietly to the door of his study.</p>

            <p>In the hall, the front door standing wide open, he recognised at once Razumov, pale
                as death, his eyes blazing, and surrounded by perplexed lackeys.</p>

            <p>The Prince was vexed beyond measure, and even indignant. But his humane instincts and
                a subtle sense of self-respect could not allow him to let this young man be thrown
                out into the street by base menials. He retreated unseen into his room, and after a
                little rang his bell. Razumov heard in the hall an ominously raised harsh voice
                saying somewhere far away —</p>

            <p>“Show the gentleman in here.”</p>

            <p>Razumov walked in without a tremor. He felt himself invulnerable — raised far above
                the shallowness of common judgment. Though he saw the Prince looking at him with
                black displeasure, the lucidity of his mind, of which he was very conscious, gave
                him an extraordinary assurance. He was not asked to sit down.</p>

            <p>Half an hour later they appeared in the hall together. The lackeys stood up, and the
                Prince, moving with difficulty on his gouty feet, was helped into his furs. The
                carriage had been ordered before. When the great double door was flung open with a
                crash, Razumov, who had been standing silent with a lost gaze but with every faculty
                intensely on the alert, heard the Prince’s voice —</p>

            <p>“Your arm, young man.”</p>

            <p>The mobile, superficial mind of the ex-Guards officer, man of showy missions,
                experienced in nothing but the arts of gallant intrigue and worldly success, had
                been equally impressed by the more obvious difficulties of such a situation and by
                Razumov’s quiet dignity in stating them.</p>

            <p>He had said, “No. Upon the whole I can’t condemn the step you ventured to take by
                coming to me with your story. It is not an affair for police understrappers. The
                greatest importance is attached to. . . . Set your mind at rest. I shall see you
                through this most extraordinary and difficult situation.”</p>

            <p>Then the Prince rose to ring the bell, and Razumov, making a short bow, had said with
                deference —</p>

            <p>“I have trusted my instinct. A young man having no claim upon anybody in the world
                has in an hour of trial involving his deepest political convictions turned to an
                illustrious Russian — that’s all.”</p>

            <p>The Prince had exclaimed hastily —</p>

            <p>“You have done well.”</p>

            <p>In the carriage — it was a small brougham on sleigh runners — Razumov broke the
                silence in a voice that trembled slightly.</p>

            <p>“My gratitude surpasses the greatness of my presumption.”</p>

            <p>He gasped, feeling unexpectedly in the dark a momentary pressure on his arm.</p>

            <p>“You have done well,” repeated the Prince.</p>

            <p>When the carriage stopped the Prince murmured to Razumov, who had never ventured a
                single question —</p>

            <p>“The house of General T——.”</p>

            <p>In the middle of the snow-covered roadway blazed a great bonfire. Some Cossacks, the
                bridles of their horses over the arm, were warming themselves around. Two sentries
                stood at the door, several gendarmes lounged under the great carriage gateway, and
                on the first-floor landing two orderlies rose and stood at attention. Razumov walked
                at the Prince’s elbow.</p>

            <p>A surprising quantity of hot-house plants in pots cumbered the floor of the
                ante-room. Servants came forward. A young man in civilian clothes arrived hurriedly,
                was whispered to, bowed low, and exclaiming zealously, “Certainly — this minute,”
                fled within somewhere. The Prince signed to Razumov.</p>

            <p>They passed through a suite of reception-rooms all barely lit and one of them
                prepared for dancing. The wife of the General had put off her party. An atmosphere
                of consternation pervaded the place. But the General’s own room, with heavy sombre
                hangings, two massive desks, and deep armchairs, had all the lights turned on. The
                footman shut the door behind them and they waited.</p>

            <p>There was a coal fire in an English grate; Razumov had never before seen such a fire;
                and the silence of the room was like the silence of the grave; perfect, measureless,
                for even the clock on the mantelpiece made no sound. Filling a corner, on a black
                pedestal, stood a quarter- life-size smooth-limbed bronze of an adolescent figure,
                running. The Prince observed in an undertone-</p>

            <p>“Spontini’s. ‘Flight of Youth.’ Exquisite.”</p>

            <p>“Admirable,” assented Razumov faintly.</p>

            <p>They said nothing more after this, the Prince silent with his grand air, Razumov
                staring at the statue. He was worried by a sensation resembling the gnawing of
                hunger.</p>

            <p>He did not turn when he heard an inner door fly open, and a quick footstep, muffled
                on the carpet.</p>

            <p>The Prince’s voice immediately exclaimed, thick with excitement —</p>

            <p>“We have got him — <hi>ce miserable</hi>. A worthy young man came to me — No! It’s
                incredible . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov held his breath before the bronze as if expecting a crash. Behind his back a
                voice he had never heard before insisted politely —</p>

            <p>“<hi>Asseyez-vous donc</hi>.”</p>

            <p>The Prince almost shrieked, “<hi>Mais comprenez- vous, mon cher! L’assassin</hi>! the
                murderer — we have got him . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov spun round. The General’s smooth big cheeks rested on the stiff collar of his
                uniform. He must have been already looking at Razumov, because that last saw the
                pale blue eyes fastened on him coldly.</p>

            <p>The Prince from a chair waved an impressive hand.</p>

            <p>“This is a most honourable young man whom Providence itself . . . Mr. Razumov.”</p>

            <p>The General acknowledged the introduction by frowning at Razumov, who did not make
                the slightest movement.</p>

            <p>Sitting down before his desk the General listened with compressed lips. It was
                impossible to detect any sign of emotion on his face.</p>

            <p>Razumov watched the immobility of the fleshy profile. But it lasted only a moment,
                till the Prince had finished; and when the General turned to the providential young
                man, his florid complexion, the blue, unbelieving eyes and the bright white flash of
                an automatic smile had an air of jovial, careless cruelty. He expressed no wonder at
                the extraordinary story — no pleasure or excitement — no incredulity either. He
                betrayed no sentiment whatever. Only with a politeness almost deferential suggested
                that “the bird might have flown while Mr. — Mr. Razumov was running about the
                streets.”</p>

            <p>Razumov advanced to the middle of the room and said, “The door is locked and I have
                the key in my pocket.”</p>

            <p>His loathing for the man was intense. It had come upon him so unawares that he felt
                he had not kept it out of his voice. The General looked up at him thoughtfully, and
                Razumov grinned.</p>

            <p>All this went over the head of Prince K—— seated in a deep armchair, very tired and
                impatient.</p>

            <p>“A student called Haldin,” said the General thoughtfully.</p>

            <p>Razumov ceased to grin.</p>

            <p>“That is his name,” he said unnecessarily loud. “Victor Victorovitch Haldin — a
                student.”</p>

            <p>The General shifted his position a little.</p>

            <p>“How is he dressed? Would you have the goodness to tell me?”</p>

            <p>Razumov angrily described Haldin’s clothing in a few jerky words. The General stared
                all the time, then addressing the Prince —</p>

            <p>“We were not without some indications,” he said in French. “A good woman who was in
                the street described to us somebody wearing a dress of the sort as the thrower of
                the second bomb. We have detained her at the Secretariat, and every one in a
                Tcherkess coat we could lay our hands on has been brought to her to look at. She
                kept on crossing herself and shaking her head at them. It was exasperating. . . .
                “He turned to Razumov, and in Russian, with friendly reproach —</p>

            <p>“Take a chair, Mr. Razumov — do. Why are you standing? ”</p>

            <p>Razumov sat down carelessly and looked at the General.</p>

            <p>“This goggle-eyed imbecile understands nothing,” he thought.</p>

            <p>The Prince began to speak loftily.</p>

            <p>“Mr. Razumov is a young man of conspicuous abilities. I have it at heart that his
                future should not . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Certainly,” interrupted the General, with a movement of the hand. “Has he any
                weapons on him, do you think, Mr. Razumov? ”</p>

            <p>The General employed a gentle musical voice. Razumov answered with suppressed
                irritation —</p>

            <p>“No. But my razors are lying about — you understand.”</p>

            <p>The General lowered his head approvingly.</p>

            <p>“Precisely.”</p>

            <p>Then to the Prince, explaining courteously —</p>

            <p>“We want that bird alive. It will be the devil if we can’t make him sing a little
                before we are done with him.”</p>

            <p>The grave-like silence of the room with its mute clock fell upon the polite
                modulations of this terrible phrase. The Prince, hidden in the chair, made no
                sound.</p>

            <p>The General unexpectedly developed a thought.</p>

            <p>“Fidelity to menaced institutions on which depend the safety of a throne and of a
                people is no child’s play. We know that, <hi>mon Prince,</hi>and — <hi>tenez</hi>
                —“he went on with a sort of flattering harshness, “Mr. Razumov here begins to
                understand that too.”</p>

            <p>His eyes which he turned upon Razumov seemed to be starting out of his head. This
                grotesqueness of aspect no longer shocked Razumov. He said with gloomy
                conviction —</p>

            <p>“Haldin will never speak.”</p>

            <p>“That remains to be seen,” muttered the General.</p>

            <p>“I am certain,” insisted Razumov. “A man like this never speaks. . . . Do you imagine
                that I am here from fear?” he added violently. He felt ready to stand by his opinion
                of Haldin to the last extremity.</p>

            <p>“Certainly not,” protested the General, with great simplicity of tone. “And I don’t
                mind telling you, Mr. Razumov, that if he had not come with his tale to such a
                staunch and loyal Russian as you, he would have disappeared like a stone in the
                water . . . which would have had a detestable effect,” he added, with a bright,
                cruel smile under his stony stare. “So you see, there can be no suspicion of any
                fear here.”</p>

            <p>The Prince intervened, looking at Razumov round the back of the armchair.</p>

            <p>“Nobody doubts the moral soundness of your action. Be at ease in that respect,
                pray.”</p>

            <p>He turned to the General uneasily.</p>

            <p>“That’s why I am here. You may be surprised why I should . . . .”</p>

            <p>The General hastened to interrupt.</p>

            <p>“Not at all. Extremely natural. You saw the importance . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes,” broke in the Prince. “And I venture to ask insistently that mine and Mr.
                Razumov’s intervention should not become public. He is a young man of promise — of
                remarkable aptitudes.”</p>

            <p>“I haven’t a doubt of it,” murmured the General. “He inspires confidence.”</p>

            <p>“All sorts of pernicious views are so widespread nowadays — they taint such
                unexpected quarters — that, monstrous as it seems, he might suffer . . . his studies
                . . . his. . .”</p>

            <p>The General, with his elbows on the desk, took his head between his hands.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Yes. I am thinking it out. . . . How long is it since you left him at your
                rooms, Mr. Razumov?”</p>

            <p>Razumov mentioned the hour which nearly corresponded with the time of his distracted
                flight from the big slum house. He had made up his mind to keep Ziemianitch out of
                the affair completely. To mention him at all would mean imprisonment for the “bright
                soul,” perhaps cruel floggings, and in the end a journey to Siberia in chains.
                Razumov, who had beaten Ziemianitch, felt for him now a vague, remorseful
                tenderness.</p>

            <p>The General, giving way for the first time to his secret sentiments, exclaimed
                contemptuously —</p>

            <p>“And you say he came in to make you this confidence like this — for nothing — <hi>a
                    propos des bottes</hi>.”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt danger in the air. The merciless suspicion of despotism had spoken
                openly at last. Sudden fear sealed Razumov’s lips. The silence of the room resembled
                now the silence of a deep dungeon, where time does not count, and a suspect person
                is sometimes forgotten for ever. But the Prince came to the rescue.</p>

            <p>“Providence itself has led the wretch in a moment of mental aberration to seek Mr.
                Razumov on the strength of some old, utterly misinterpreted exchange of ideas — some
                sort of idle speculative conversation — months ago — I am told — and completely
                forgotten till now by Mr. Razumov.”</p>

            <p>“Mr. Razumov,” queried the General meditatively, after a short silence, “do you often
                indulge in speculative conversation?”</p>

            <p>“No, Excellency,” answered Razumov, coolly, in a sudden access of self-confidence. “I
                am a man of deep convictions. Crude opinions are in the air. They are not always
                worth combating. But even the silent contempt of a serious mind may be
                misinterpreted by headlong utopists.”</p>

            <p>The General stared from between his hands. Prince K—— murmured —</p>

            <p>“A serious young man. <hi>Un esprit superieur</hi>.”</p>

            <p>“I see that, <hi>mon cher Prince</hi>,” said the General. “Mr. Razumov is quite safe
                with me. I am interested in him. He has, it seems, the great and useful quality of
                inspiring confidence. What I was wondering at is why the other should mention
                anything at all — I mean even the bare fact alone — if his object was only to obtain
                temporary shelter for a few hours. For, after all, nothing was easier than to say
                nothing about it unless, indeed, he were trying, under a crazy misapprehension of
                your true sentiments, to enlist your assistance — eh, Mr. Razumov?”</p>

            <p>It seemed to Razumov that the floor was moving slightly. This grotesque man in a
                tight uniform was terrible. It was right that he should be terrible.</p>

            <p>“I can see what your Excellency has in your mind. But I can only answer that I don’t
                know why.”</p>

            <p>“I have nothing in my mind,” murmured the General, with gentle surprise.</p>

            <p>“I am his prey — his helpless prey,” thought Razumov. The fatigues and the disgusts
                of that afternoon, the need to forget, the fear which he could not keep off,
                reawakened his hate for Haldin.</p>

            <p>“Then I can’t help your Excellency. I don’t know what he meant. I only know there was
                a moment when I wished to kill him. There was also a moment when I wished myself
                dead. I said nothing. I was overcome. I provoked no confidence — I asked for no
                explanations —”</p>

            <p>Razumov seemed beside himself; but his mind was lucid. It was really a calculated
                outburst.</p>

            <p>“It is rather a pity,” the General said, “that you did not. Don’t you know at all
                what he means to do?” Razumov calmed down and saw an opening there.</p>

            <p>“He told me he was in hopes that a sledge would meet him about half an hour after
                midnight at the seventh lamp-post on the left from the upper end of Karabelnaya. At
                any rate, he meant to be there at that time. He did not even ask me for a change of
                clothes.”</p>

            <p>“<hi>Ah voila</hi>!” said the General, turning to Prince K with an air of
                satisfaction. “There is a way to keep your <hi>protege</hi>, Mr. Razumov, quite
                clear of any connexion with the actual arrest. We shall be ready for that gentleman
                in Karabelnaya.”</p>

            <p>The Prince expressed his gratitude. There was real emotion in his voice. Razumov,
                motionless, silent, sat staring at the carpet. The General turned to him.</p>

            <p>“Half an hour after midnight. Till then we have to depend on you, Mr. Razumov. You
                don’t think he is likely to change his purpose?”</p>

            <p>“How can I tell?” said Razumov. “Those men are not of the sort that ever changes its
                purpose.”</p>

            <p>“What men do you mean?”</p>

            <p>“Fanatical lovers of liberty in general. Liberty with a capital L, Excellency.
                Liberty that means nothing precise. Liberty in whose name crimes are committed.”</p>

            <p>The General murmured —</p>

            <p>“I detest rebels of every kind. I can’t help it. It’s my nature!”</p>

            <p>He clenched a fist and shook it, drawing back his arm. “They shall be destroyed,
                then.”</p>

            <p>“They have made a sacrifice of their lives beforehand,” said Razumov with malicious
                pleasure and looking the General straight in the face. “If Haldin does change his
                purpose to- night, you may depend on it that it will not be to save his life by
                flight in some other way. He would have thought then of something else to attempt.
                But that is not likely.”</p>

            <p>The General repeated as if to himself, “They shall be destroyed.”</p>

            <p>Razumov assumed an impenetrable expression.</p>

            <p>The Prince exclaimed —</p>

            <p>“What a terrible necessity!”</p>

            <p>The General’s arm was lowered slowly.</p>

            <p>“One comfort there is. That brood leaves no posterity. I’ve always said it, one
                effort, pitiless, persistent, steady — and we are done with them for ever.”</p>

            <p>Razumov thought to himself that this man entrusted with so much arbitrary power must
                have believed what he said or else he could not have gone on bearing the
                responsibility.</p>

            <p>“I detest rebels. These subversive minds! These intellectual <hi>debauches</hi>! My
                existence has been built on fidelity. It’s a feeling. To defend it I am ready to lay
                down my life — and even my honour — if that were needed. But pray tell me what
                honour can there be as against rebels — against people that deny God Himself —
                perfect unbelievers! Brutes. It is horrible to think of.”</p>

            <p>During this tirade Razumov, facing the General, had nodded slightly twice. Prince K—
                — standing on one side with his grand air, murmured, casting up his eyes —</p>

            <p>“<hi>Helas!</hi>”</p>

            <p>Then lowering his glance and with great decision declared —</p>

            <p>“This young man, General, is perfectly fit to apprehend the bearing of your memorable
                words.”</p>

            <p>The General’s whole expression changed from dull resentment to perfect urbanity.</p>

            <p>“I would ask now, Mr. Razumov,” he said, “to return to his home. Note that I don’t
                ask Mr. Razumov whether he has justified his absence to his guest. No doubt he did
                this sufficiently. But I don’t ask. Mr. Razumov inspires confidence. It is a great
                gift. I only suggest that a more prolonged absence might awaken the criminal’s
                suspicions and induce him perhaps to change his plans.”</p>

            <p>He rose and with a scrupulous courtesy escorted his visitors to the ante-room
                encumbered with flower-pots.</p>

            <p>Razumov parted with the Prince at the corner of a street. In the carriage he had
                listened to speeches where natural sentiment struggled with caution. Evidently the
                Prince was afraid of encouraging any hopes of future intercourse. But there was a
                touch of tenderness in the voice uttering in the dark the guarded general phrases of
                goodwill. And the Prince too said —</p>

            <p>“I have perfect confidence in you, Mr. Razumov.”</p>

            <p>“They all, it seems, have confidence in me,” thought Razumov dully. He had an
                indulgent contempt for the man sitting shoulder to shoulder with him in the confined
                space. Probably he was afraid of scenes with his wife. She was said to be proud and
                violent.</p>

            <p>It seemed to him bizarre that secrecy should play such a large part in the comfort
                and safety of lives. But he wanted to put the Prince’s mind at ease; and with a
                proper amount of emphasis he said that, being conscious of some small abilities and
                confident in his power of work, he trusted his future to his own exertions. He
                expressed his gratitude for the helping hand. Such dangerous situations did not
                occur twice in the course of one life — he added.</p>

            <p>“And you have met this one with a firmness of mind and correctness of feeling which
                give me a high idea of your worth,” the Prince said solemnly. “You have now only to
                persevere — to persevere.”</p>

            <p>On getting out on the pavement Razumov saw an ungloved hand extended to him through
                the lowered window of the brougham. It detained his own in its grasp for a moment,
                while the light of a street lamp fell upon the Prince’s long face and old-fashioned
                grey whiskers.</p>

            <p>“I hope you are perfectly reassured now as to the consequences . . . ”</p>

            <p>“After what your Excellency has condescended to do for me, I can only rely on my
                conscience.”</p>

            <p>“<hi>Adieu</hi>,” said the whiskered head with feeling.</p>

            <p>Razumov bowed. The brougham glided away with a slight swish in the snow — he was
                alone on the edge of the pavement.</p>

            <p>He said to himself that there was nothing to think about, and began walking towards
                his home.</p>

            <p>He walked quietly. It was a common experience to walk thus home to bed after an
                evening spent somewhere with his fellows or in the cheaper seats of a theatre. After
                he had gone a little way the familiarity of things got hold of him. Nothing was
                changed. There was the familiar corner; and when he turned it he saw the familiar
                dim light of the provision shop kept by a German woman. There were loaves of stale
                bread, bunches of onions and strings of sausages behind the small window-panes. They
                were closing it. The sickly lame fellow whom he knew so well by sight staggered out
                into the snow embracing a large shutter.</p>

            <p>Nothing would change. There was the familiar gateway yawning black with feeble
                glimmers marking the arches of the different staircases.</p>

            <p>The sense of life’s continuity depended on trifling bodily impressions. The
                trivialities of daily existence were an armour for the soul. And this thought
                reinforced the inward quietness of Razumov as he began to climb the stairs familiar
                to his feet in the dark, with his hand on the familiar clammy banister. The
                exceptional could not prevail against the material contacts which make one day
                resemble another. To-morrow would be like yesterday.</p>

            <p>It was only on the stage that the unusual was outwardly acknowledged.</p>

            <p>“I suppose,” thought Razumov, “that if I had made up my mind to blow out my brains on
                the landing I would be going up these stairs as quietly as I am doing it now. What’s
                a man to do? What must be must be. Extraordinary things do happen. But when they
                have happened they are done with. Thus, too, when the mind is made up. That question
                is done with. And the daily concerns, the familiarities of our thought swallow it up
                — and the life goes on as before with its mysterious and secret sides quite out of
                sight, as they should be. Life is a public thing.”</p>

            <p>Razumov unlocked his door and took the key out; entered very quietly and bolted the
                door behind him carefully.</p>

            <p>He thought, “He hears me,” and after bolting the door he stood still holding his
                breath. There was not a sound. He crossed the bare outer room, stepping deliberately
                in the darkness. Entering the other, he felt all over his table for the matchbox.
                The silence, but for the groping of his hand, was profound. Could the fellow be
                sleeping so soundly?</p>

            <p>He struck a light and looked at the bed. Haldin was lying on his back as before, only
                both his hands were under his head. His eyes were open. He stared at the
                ceiling.</p>

            <p>Razumov held the match up. He saw the clear-cut features, the firm chin, the white
                forehead and the topknot of fair hair against the white pillow. There he was, lying
                flat on his back. Razumov thought suddenly, “I have walked over his chest.”</p>

            <p>He continued to stare till the match burnt itself out; then struck another and lit
                the lamp in silence without looking towards the bed any more. He had turned his back
                on it and was hanging his coat on a peg when he heard Haldin sigh profoundly, then
                ask in a tired voice —</p>

            <p>“Well! And what have you arranged?”</p>

            <p>The emotion was so great that Razumov was glad to put his hands against the wall. A
                diabolical impulse to say, “I have given you up to the police,” frightened him
                exceedingly. But he did not say that. He said, without turning round, in a muffled
                voice —</p>

            <p>“It’s done.”</p>

            <p>Again he heard Haldin sigh. He walked to the table, sat down with the lamp before
                him, and only then looked towards the bed.</p>

            <p>In the distant corner of the large room far away from the lamp, which was small and
                provided with a very thick china shade, Haldin appeared like a dark and elongated
                shape — rigid with the immobility of death. This body seemed to have less substance
                than its own phantom walked over by Razumov in the street white with snow. It was
                more alarming in its shadowy, persistent reality than the distinct but vanishing
                illusion.</p>

            <p>Haldin was heard again.</p>

            <p>“You must have had a walk — such a walk. . .” he murmured deprecatingly.’’ This
                weather . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov answered with energy —</p>

            <p>“Horrible walk. . . . A nightmare of a walk.”</p>

            <p>He shuddered audibly. Haldin sighed once more, then —</p>

            <p>“And so you have seen Ziemianitch — brother?”</p>

            <p>“I’ve seen him.”</p>

            <p>Razumov, remembering the time he had spent with the Prince, thought it prudent to
                add, “I had to wait some time.”</p>

            <p>“A character — eh? It’s extraordinary what a sense of the necessity of freedom there
                is in that man. And he has sayings too — simple, to the point, such as only the
                people can invent in their rough sagacity. A character that . . . .”</p>

            <p>“I, you understand, haven’t had much opportunity . . . .” Razumov muttered through
                his teeth.</p>

            <p>Haldin continued to stare at the ceiling.</p>

            <p>“You see, brother, I have been a good deal in that house of late. I used to take
                there books — leaflets. Not a few of the poor people who live there can read. And,
                you see, the guests for the feast of freedom must be sought for in byways and
                hedges. The truth is, I have almost lived in that house of late. I slept sometimes
                in the stable. There is a stable . . . .”</p>

            <p>“That’s where I had my interview with Ziemianitch,” interrupted Razumov gently. A
                mocking spirit entered into him and he added, “It was satisfactory in a sense. I
                came away from it much relieved.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! he’s a fellow,” went on Haldin, talking slowly at the ceiling. “I came to know
                him in that way, you see. For some weeks now, ever since I resigned myself to do
                what had to be done, I tried to isolate myself. I gave up my rooms. What was the
                good of exposing a decent widow woman to the risk of being worried out of her mind
                by the police? I gave up seeing any of our comrades . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov drew to himself a half-sheet of paper and began to trace lines on it with a
                pencil.</p>

            <p>“Upon my word,” he thought angrily, “he seems to have thought of everybody’s safety
                but mine.”</p>

            <p>Haldin was talking on.</p>

            <p>“This morning — ah! this morning — that was different. How can I explain to you?
                Before the deed was done I wandered at night and lay hid in the day, thinking it
                out, and I felt restful. Sleepless but restful. What was there for me to torment
                myself about? But this morning — after! Then it was that I became restless. I could
                not have stopped in that big house full of misery. The miserable of this world can’t
                give you peace. Then when that silly caretaker began to shout, I said to myself,
                ‘There is a young man in this town head and shoulders above common prejudices.’”</p>

            <p>“Is he laughing at me?” .Razumov asked himself, going on with his aimless drawing of
                triangles and squares. And suddenly he thought: “My behaviour must appear to him
                strange. Should he take fright at my manner and rush off somewhere I shall be undone
                completely. That infernal General . . . .”</p>

            <p>He dropped the pencil and turned abruptly towards the bed with the shadowy figure
                extended full length on it — so much more indistinct than the one over whose breast
                he had walked without faltering. Was this, too, a phantom?</p>

            <p>The silence had lasted a long time. “He is no longer here,” was the thought against
                which Razumov struggled desperately, quite frightened at its absurdity. “He is
                already gone and this. . .only . . . .”</p>

            <p>He could resist no longer. He sprang to his feet, saying aloud, “I am intolerably
                anxious,” and in a few headlong strides stood by the side of the bed. His hand fell
                lightly on Haldin’s shoulder, and directly he felt its reality he was beset by an
                insane temptation to grip that exposed throat and squeeze the breath out of that
                body, lest it should escape his custody, leaving only a phantom behind.</p>

            <p>Haldin did not stir a limb, but his overshadowed eyes moving a little gazed upwards
                at Razumov with wistful gratitude for this manifestation of feeling.</p>

            <p>Razumov turned away and strode up and down the room. “It would have been possibly a
                kindness,” he muttered to himself, and was appalled by the nature of that apology
                for a murderous intention his mind had found somewhere within him. And all the same
                he could not give it up. He became lucid about it. “What can he expect?” he thought.
                “The halter — in the end. And I . . . .”</p>

            <p>This argument was interrupted by Haldin’s voice.</p>

            <p>“Why be anxious for me? They can kill my body, but they cannot exile my soul from
                this world. I tell you what — I believe in this world so much that I cannot conceive
                eternity otherwise than as a very long life. That is perhaps the reason I am so
                ready to die.”</p>

            <p>“H’m,” muttered Razumov, and biting his lower lip he continued to walk up and down
                and to carry on his strange argument.</p>

            <p>Yes, to a man in such a situation — of course it would be an act of kindness. The
                question, however, was not how to be kind, but how to be firm. He was a slippery
                customer</p>

            <p>“I too, Victor Victorovitch, believe in this world of ours,” he said with force. “I
                too, while I live. . . . But you seem determined to haunt it. You can’t seriously
                . . . mean”</p>

            <p>The voice of the motionless Haldin began —</p>

            <p>“Haunt it! Truly, the oppressors of thought which quickens the world, the destroyers
                of souls which aspire to perfection of human dignity, they shall be haunted. As to
                the destroyers of my mere body, I have forgiven them beforehand.”</p>

            <p>Razumov had stopped apparently to listen, but at the same time he was observing his
                own sensations. He was vexed with himself for attaching so much importance to what
                Haldin said.</p>

            <p>“The fellow’s mad,” he thought firmly, but this opinion did not mollify him towards
                Haldin. It was a particularly impudent form of lunacy — and when it got loose in the
                sphere of public life of a country, it was obviously the duty of every good citizen
                . . . .</p>

            <p>This train of thought broke off short there and was succeeded by a paroxysm of silent
                hatred towards Haldin, so intense that Razumov hastened to speak at random.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Eternity, of course. I, too, can’t very well represent it to myself. . . . I
                imagine it, however, as something quiet and dull. There would be nothing unexpected
                — don’t you see? The element of time would be wanting.”</p>

            <p>He pulled out his watch and gazed at it. Haldin turned over on his side and looked on
                intently.</p>

            <p>Razumov got frightened at this movement. A slippery customer this fellow with a
                phantom. It was not midnight yet. He hastened on —</p>

            <p>“And unfathomable mysteries! Can you conceive secret places in Eternity? Impossible.
                Whereas life is full of them. There are secrets of birth, for instance. One carries
                them on to the grave. There is something comical . . . but never mind. And there are
                secret motives of conduct. A man’s most open actions have a secret side to them.
                That is interesting and so unfathomable! For instance, a man goes out of a room for
                a walk. Nothing more trivial in appearance. And yet it may be momentous. He comes
                back — he has seen perhaps a drunken brute, taken particular notice of the snow on
                the ground — and behold he is no longer the same man. The most unlikely things have
                a secret power over one’s thoughts — the grey whiskers of a particular person — the
                goggle eyes of another.”</p>

            <p>Razumov’s forehead was moist. He took a turn or two in the room, his head low and
                smiling to himself viciously.</p>

            <p>“Have you ever reflected on the power of goggle eyes and grey whiskers? Excuse me.
                You seem to think I must be crazy to talk in this vein at such a time. But I am not
                talking lightly. I have seen instances. It has happened to me once to be talking to
                a man whose fate was affected by physical facts of that kind. And the man did not
                know it. Of course, it was a case of conscience, but the material facts such as
                these brought about the solution. . . . And you tell me, Victor Victorovitch, not to
                be anxious! Why! I am responsible for you,” Razumov almost shrieked.</p>

            <p>He avoided with difficulty a burst of Mephistophelian laughter. Haldin, very pale,
                raised himself on his elbow.</p>

            <p>“And the surprises of life,” went on Razumov, after glancing at the other uneasily.
                “Just consider their astonishing nature. A mysterious impulse induces you to come
                here. I don’t say you have done wrong. Indeed, from a certain point of view you
                could not have done better. You might have gone to a man with affections and family
                ties. You have such ties yourself. As to me, you know I have been brought up in an
                educational institute where they did not give us enough to eat. To talk of affection
                in such a connexion — you perceive yourself. . . . As to ties, the only ties I have
                in the world are social. I must get acknowledged in some way before I can act at
                all. I sit here working. . . . And don’t you think I am working for progress too?
                I’ve got to find my own ideas of the true way. . . . Pardon me,” continued Razumov,
                after drawing breath and with a short, throaty laugh, “but I haven’t inherited a
                revolutionary inspiration together with a resemblance from an uncle.”</p>

            <p>He looked again at his watch and noticed with sickening disgust that there were yet a
                good many minutes to midnight. He tore watch and chain off his waistcoat and laid
                them on the table well in the circle of bright lamplight. Haldin, reclining on his
                elbow, did not stir. Razumov was made uneasy by this attitude. “What move is he
                meditating over so quietly?” he thought. “He must be prevented. I must keep on
                talking to him.”</p>

            <p>He raised his voice.</p>

            <p>“You are a son, a brother, a nephew, a cousin — I don’t know what — to no end of
                people. I am just a man. Here I stand before you. A man with a mind. Did it ever
                occur to you how a man who had never heard a word of warm affection or praise in his
                life would think on matters on which you would think first with or against your
                class, your domestic tradition — your fireside prejudices? . . . Did you ever
                consider how a man like that would feel? I have no domestic tradition. I have
                nothing to think against. My tradition is historical. What have I to look back to
                but that national past from which you gentlemen want to wrench away your future? Am
                I to let my intelligence, my aspirations towards a better lot, be robbed of the only
                thing it has to go upon at the will of violent enthusiasts? You come from your
                province, but all this land is mine — or I have nothing. No doubt you shall be
                looked upon as a martyr some day — a sort of hero — a political saint. But I beg to
                be excused. I am content in fitting myself to be a worker. And what can you people
                do by scattering a few drops of blood on the snow? On this Immensity. On this
                unhappy Immensity! I tell you,” he cried, in a vibrating, subdued voice, and
                advancing one step nearer the bed, “that what it needs is not a lot of haunting
                phantoms that I could walk through — but a man!”</p>

            <p>Haldin threw his arms forward as if to keep him off in horror.</p>

            <p>“I understand it all now,” he exclaimed, with awestruck dismay. “I understand — at
                last.”</p>

            <p>Razumov staggered back against the table. His forehead broke out in perspiration
                while a cold shudder ran down his spine.</p>

            <p>“What have I been saying?” he asked himself. “Have I let him slip through my fingers
                after all?”</p>

            <p>“He felt his lips go stiff like buckram, and instead of a reassuring smile only
                achieved an uncertain grimace.</p>

            <p>“What will you have?” he began in a conciliating voice which got steady after the
                first trembling word or two. “What will you have? Consider — a man of studious,
                retired habits — and suddenly like this. . . . I am not practised in talking
                delicately. But . . . .”</p>

            <p>He felt anger, a wicked anger, get hold of him again.</p>

            <p>“What were we to do together till midnight? Sit here opposite each other and think of
                your — your- shambles? ”</p>

            <p>Haldin had a subdued, heartbroken attitude. He bowed his head; his hands hung between
                his knees. His voice was low and pained but calm.</p>

            <p>“I see now how it is, Razumov — brother. You are a magnanimous soul, but my action is
                abhorrent to you — alas . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov stared. From fright he had set his teeth so hard that his whole face ached.
                It was impossible for him to make a sound.</p>

            <p>“And even my person, too, is loathsome to you perhaps,” Haldin added mournfully,
                after a short pause, looking up for a moment, then fixing his gaze on the floor.
                “For indeed, unless one . . . .”</p>

            <p>He broke off evidently waiting for a word. Razumov remained silent. Haldin nodded his
                head dejectedly twice.</p>

            <p>“Of course. Of course,” he murmured. . . . “Ah! weary work!”</p>

            <p>He remained perfectly still for a moment, then made Razumov’s leaden heart strike a
                ponderous blow by springing up briskly.</p>

            <p>“So be it,” he cried sadly in a low, distinct tone. “Farewell then.”</p>

            <p>Razumov started forward, but the sight of Haldin’s raised hand checked him before he
                could get away from the table. He leaned on it heavily, listening to the faint
                sounds of some town clock tolling the hour. Haldin, already at the door, tall and
                straight as an arrow, with his pale face and a hand raised attentively, might have
                posed for the statue of a daring youth listening to an inner voice. Razumov
                mechanically glanced down at his watch. When he looked towards the door again Haldin
                had vanished. There was a faint rustling in the outer room, the feeble click of a
                bolt drawn back lightly. He was gone — almost as noiseless as a vision.</p>

            <p>Razumov ran forward unsteadily, with parted, voiceless lips. The outer door stood
                open. Staggering out on the landing, he leaned far over the banister. Gazing down
                into the deep black shaft with a tiny glimmering flame at the bottom, he traced by
                ear the rapid spiral descent of somebody running down the stairs on tiptoe. It was a
                light, swift, pattering sound, which sank away from him into the depths: a fleeting
                shadow passed over the glimmer — a wink of the tiny flame. Then stillness.</p>

            <p>Razumov hung over, breathing the cold raw air tainted by the evil smells of the
                unclean staircase. All quiet.</p>

            <p>He went back into his room slowly, shutting the doors after him. The peaceful steady
                light of his reading-lamp shone on the watch. Razumov stood looking down at the
                little white dial. It wanted yet three minutes to midnight. He took the watch into
                his hand fumblingly.</p>

            <p>“Slow,” he muttered, and a strange fit of nervelessness came over him. His knees
                shook, the watch and chain slipped through his fingers in an instant and fell on the
                floor. He was so startled that he nearly fell himself. When at last he regained
                enough confidence in his limbs to stoop for it he held it to his ear at once. After
                a while he growled —</p>

            <p>“Stopped,” and paused for quite a long time before he muttered sourly —</p>

            <p>“It’s done. . . . And now to work.”</p>

            <p>He sat down, reached haphazard for a book, opened it in middle and began to read; but
                after going conscientiously over two lines he lost his hold on the print completely
                and did not try to regain it. He thought —</p>

            <p>“There was to a certainty a police agent of some sort watching the house across the
                street.”</p>

            <p>He imagined him lurking in a dark gateway, goggle-eyed, muffled up in a cloak to the
                nose and with a General’s plumed, cocked hat on his head. This absurdity made him
                start in the chair convulsively. He literally had to shake his head violently to get
                rid of it. The man would be disguised perhaps as a peasant . . . a beggar. . . .
                Perhaps he would be just buttoned up in a dark overcoat and carrying a loaded stick
                — a shifty-eyed rascal, smelling of raw onions and spirits.</p>

            <p>This evocation brought on positive nausea. “Why do I want to bother about this?”
                thought Razumov with disgust. “Am I a gendarme? Moreover, it is done.”</p>

            <p>He got up in great agitation. It was not done. Not yet. Not till half-past twelve.
                And the watch had stopped. This reduced him to despair. Impossible to know the time!
                The landlady and all the people across the landing were asleep. How could he go and.
                . . . God knows what they would imagine, or how much they would guess. He dared not
                go into the streets to find out. “I am a suspect now. There’s no use shirking that
                fact,” he said to himself bitterly. If Haldin from some cause or another gave them
                the slip and failed to turn up in the Karabelnaya the police would be invading his
                lodging. And if he were not in he could never clear himself. Never. Razumov looked
                wildly about as if for some means of seizing upon time which seemed to have escaped
                him altogether. He had never, as far as he could remember, heard the striking of
                that town clock in his rooms before this night. And he was not even sure now whether
                he had heard it really on this night.</p>

            <p>He went to the window and stood there with slightly bent head on the watch for the
                faint sound. ‘I will stay here till I hear something,” he said to himself. He stood
                still, his ear turned to the panes. An atrocious aching numbness with shooting pains
                in his back and legs tortured him. He did not budge. His mind hovered on the borders
                of delirium. He heard himself suddenly saying, “I confess,” as a person might do on
                the rack. “I am on the rack,” he thought. He felt ready to swoon. The faint deep
                boom of the distant clock seemed to explode in his head — he heard it so clearly.
                . . . One!</p>

            <p>If Haldin had not turned up the police would have been already here ransacking the
                house. No sound reached him. This time it was done.</p>

            <p>He dragged himself painfully to the table and dropped into the chair. He flung the
                book away and took a square sheet of paper. It was like the pile of sheets covered
                with his neat minute handwriting, only blank. He took a pen brusquely and dipped it
                with a vague notion of going on with the writing of his essay — but his pen remained
                poised over the sheet. It hung there for some time before it came down and formed
                long scrawly letters.</p>

            <p>Still-faced and his lips set hard, Razumov began to write. When he wrote a large hand
                his neat writing lost its character altogether — became unsteady, almost childish.
                He wrote five lines one under the other. History not Theory. Patriotism not
                Internationalism. Evolution not Revolution. Direction not Destruction. Unity not
                Disruption.</p>

            <p>He gazed at them dully. Then his eyes strayed to the bed and remained fixed there for
                a good many minutes, while his right hand groped all over the table for the
                penknife.</p>

            <p>He rose at last, and walking up with measured steps stabbed the paper with the
                penknife to the lath and plaster wall at the head of the bed. This done he stepped
                back a pace and flourished his hand with a glance round the room.</p>

            <p>After that he never looked again at the bed. He took his big cloak down from its peg
                and, wrapping himself up closely, went to lie down on the hard horse-hair sofa at
                the other side of his room. A leaden sleep closed his eyelids at once. Several times
                that night he woke up shivering from a dream of walking through drifts of snow in a
                Russia where he was as completely alone as any betrayed autocrat could be; an
                immense, wintry Russia which, somehow, his view could embrace in all its enormous
                expanse as if it were a map. But after each shuddering start his heavy eyelids fell
                over his glazed eyes and he slept again.</p>

            <head>3</head>


            <p>Approaching this part of Mr. Razumov’s story, my mind, the decent mind of an old
                teacher of languages, feels more and more the difficulty of the task.</p>

            <p>The task is not in truth the writing in the narrative form a <hi>precis</hi> of a
                strange human document, but the rendering — I perceive it now clearly — of the moral
                conditions ruling over a large portion of this earth’s surface; conditions not
                easily to be understood, much less discovered in the limits of a story, till some
                key-word is found; a word that could stand at the back of all the words covering the
                pages; a word which, if not truth itself, may perchance hold truth enough to help
                the moral discovery which should be the object of every tale.</p>

            <p>I turn over for the hundredth time the leaves of Mr. Razumov’s record, I lay it
                aside, I take up the pen — and the pen being ready for its office of setting down
                black on white I hesitate. For the word that persists in creeping under its point is
                no other word than “cynicism.”</p>

            <p>For that is the mark of Russian autocracy and of Russian revolt. In its pride of
                numbers, in its strange pretensions of sanctity, and in the secret readiness to
                abase itself in suffering, the spirit of Russia is the spirit of cynicism. It
                informs the declarations of her statesmen, the theories of her revolutionists, and
                the mystic vaticinations of prophets to the point of making freedom look like a form
                of debauch, and the Christian virtues themselves appear actually indecent. . . . But
                I must apologize for the digression. It proceeds from the consideration of the
                course taken by the story of Mr. Razumov after his conservative convictions, diluted
                in a vague liberalism natural to the ardour of his age, had become crystallized by
                the shock of his contact with Haldin.</p>

            <p>Razumov woke up for the tenth time perhaps with a heavy shiver. Seeing the light of
                day in his window, he resisted the inclination to lay himself down again. He did not
                remember anything, but he did not think it strange to find himself on the sofa in
                his cloak and chilled to the bone. The light coming through the window seemed
                strangely cheerless, containing no promise as the light of each new day should for a
                young man. It was the awakening of a man mortally ill, or of a man ninety years old.
                He looked at the lamp which had burnt itself out. It stood there, the extinguished
                beacon of his labours, a cold object of brass and porcelain, amongst the scattered
                pages of his notes and small piles of books — a mere litter of blackened paper —
                dead matter — without significance or interest.</p>

            <p>He got on his feet, and divesting himself of his cloak hung it on the peg, going
                through all the motions mechanically. An incredible dullness, a ditch-water
                stagnation was sensible to his perceptions as though life had withdrawn itself from
                all things and even from his own thoughts. There was not a sound in the house.</p>

            <p>Turning away from the peg, he thought in that same lifeless manner that it must be
                very early yet; but when he looked at the watch on his table he saw both hands
                arrested at twelve o’clock.</p>

            <p>“Ah! yes,” he mumbled to himself, and as if beginning to get roused a little he took
                a survey of his room. The paper stabbed to the wall arrested his attention. He eyed
                it from the distance without approval or perplexity; but when he heard the
                servant-girl beginning to bustle about in the outer room with the <hi>samovar</hi>
                for his morning tea, he walked up to it and took it down with an air of profound
                indifference.</p>

            <p>While doing this he glanced down at the bed on which he had not slept that night. The
                hollow in the pillow made by the weight of Haldin’s head was very noticeable.</p>

            <p>Even his anger at this sign of the man’s passage was dull. He did not try to nurse it
                into life. He did nothing all that day; he neglected even to brush his hair. The
                idea of going out never occurred to him — and if he did not start a connected train
                of thought it was not because he was unable to think. It was because he was not
                interested enough.</p>

            <p>He yawned frequently. He drank large quantities of tea, he walked about aimlessly,
                and when he sat down he did not budge for a long time. He spent some time drumming
                on the window with his finger-tips quietly. In his listless wanderings round about
                the table he caught sight of his own face in the looking-glass and that arrested
                him. The eyes which returned his stare were the most unhappy eyes he had ever seen.
                And this was the first thing which disturbed the mental stagnation of that day.</p>

            <p>He was not affected personally. He merely thought that life without happiness is
                impossible. What was happiness? He yawned and went on shuffling about and about
                between the walls of his room. Looking forward was happiness — that’s all — nothing
                more. To look forward to the gratification of some desire, to the gratification of
                some passion, love, ambition, hate — hate too indubitably. Love and hate. And to
                escape the dangers of existence, to live without fear, was also happiness. There was
                nothing else. Absence of fear — looking forward. “Oh! the miserable lot of
                humanity!” he exclaimed mentally; and added at once in his thought, “I ought to be
                happy enough as far as that goes.” But he was not excited by that assurance. On the
                contrary, he yawned again as he had been yawning all day. He was mildly surprised to
                discover himself being overtaken by night. The room grew dark swiftly though time
                had seemed to stand still. How was it that he had not noticed the passing of that
                day? Of course, it was the watch being stopped . . . .</p>

            <p>He did not light his lamp, but went over to the bed and threw himself on it without
                any hesitation. Lying on his back, he put his hands under his head and stared
                upward. After a moment he thought, “I am lying here like that man. I wonder if he
                slept while I was struggling with the blizzard in the streets. No, he did not sleep.
                But why should I not sleep?” and he felt the silence of the night press upon all his
                limbs like a weight.</p>

            <p>In the calm of the hard frost outside, the clear- cut strokes of the town clock
                counting off midnight penetrated the quietness of his suspended animation.</p>

            <p>Again he began to think. It was twenty-four hours since that man left his room.
                Razumov had a distinct feeling that Haldin in the fortress was sleeping that night.
                It was a certitude which made him angry because he did not want to think of Haldin,
                but he justified it to himself by physiological and psychological reasons. The
                fellow had hardly slept for weeks on his own confession, and now every incertitude
                was at an end for him. No doubt he was looking forward to the consummation of his
                martyrdom. A man who resigns himself to kill need not go very far for resignation to
                die. Haldin slept perhaps more soundly than General T— — whose task — weary work too
                — was not done, and over whose head hung the sword of revolutionary vengeance.</p>

            <p>Razumov, remembering the thick-set man with his heavy jowl resting on the collar of
                his uniform, the champion of autocracy, who had let no sign of surprise,
                incredulity, or joy escape him, but whose goggle eyes could express a mortal hatred
                of all rebellion — Razumov moved uneasily on the bed.</p>

            <p>“He suspected me,” he thought. “I suppose he must suspect everybody. He would be
                capable of suspecting his own wife, if Haldin had gone to her boudoir with his
                confession.”</p>

            <p>Razumov sat up in anguish. Was he to remain a political suspect all his days? Was he
                to go through life as a man not wholly to be trusted — with a bad secret police note
                tacked on to his record? What sort of future could he look forward to?</p>

            <p>“I am now a suspect,” he thought again; but the habit of reflection and that desire
                of safety, of an ordered life, which was so strong in him came to his assistance as
                the night wore on. His quiet, steady, and laborious existence would vouch at length
                for his loyalty. There were many permitted ways to serve one’s country. There was an
                activity that made for progress without being revolutionary. The field of influence
                was great and infinitely varied — once one had conquered a name.</p>

            <p>His thought like a circling bird reverted after four-and-twenty hours to the silver
                medal, and as it were poised itself there.</p>

            <p>When the day broke he had not slept, not for a moment, but he got up not very tired
                and quite sufficiently self-possessed for all practical purposes.</p>

            <p>He went out and attended three lectures in the morning. But the work in the library
                was a mere dumb show of research. He sat with many volumes open before him trying to
                make notes and extracts. His new tranquillity was like a flimsy garment, and seemed
                to float at the mercy of a casual word. Betrayal! Why! the fellow had done all that
                was necessary to betray himself. Precious little had been needed to deceive him.</p>

            <p>“I have said no word to him that was not strictly true. Not one word,” Razumov argued
                with himself.</p>

            <p>Once engaged on this line of thought there could be no question of doing useful work.
                The same ideas went on passing through his mind, and he pronounced mentally the same
                words over and over again. He shut up all the books and rammed all his papers into
                his pocket with convulsive movements, raging inwardly against Haldin.</p>

            <p>As he was leaving the library a long bony student in a threadbare overcoat joined
                him, stepping moodily by his side. Razumov answered his mumbled greeting without
                looking at him at all.</p>

            <p>“What does he want with me? “he thought with a strange dread of the unexpected which
                he tried to shake off lest it should fasten itself upon his life for good and all.
                And the other, muttering cautiously with downcast eyes, supposed that his comrade
                had seen the news of de P——‘s executioner — that was the expression he used — having
                been arrested the night before last . . . .</p>

            <p>“I’ve been ill — shut up in my rooms,” Razumov mumbled through his teeth.</p>

            <p>The tall student, raising his shoulders, shoved his hands deep into his pockets. He
                had a hairless, square, tallowy chin which trembled slightly as he spoke, and his
                nose nipped bright red by the sharp air looked like a false nose of painted
                cardboard between the sallow cheeks. His whole appearance was stamped with the mark
                of cold and hunger. He stalked deliberately at Razumov’s elbow with his eyes on the
                ground.</p>

            <p>“It’s an official statement,” he continued in the same cautious mutter.” It may be a
                lie. But there was somebody arrested between midnight and one in the morning on
                Tuesday. This is certain.”</p>

            <p>And talking rapidly under the cover of his downcast air, he told Razumov that this
                was known through an inferior Government clerk employed at the Central Secretariat.
                That man belonged to one of the revolutionary circles. “The same, in fact, I am
                affiliated to,” remarked the student.</p>

            <p>They were crossing a wide quadrangle. An infinite distress possessed Razumov,
                annihilated his energy, and before his eyes everything appeared confused and as if
                evanescent. He dared not leave the fellow there. “He may be affiliated to the
                police,” was the thought that passed through his mind. “Who could tell?” But eyeing
                the miserable frost-nipped, famine-struck figure of his companion he perceived the
                absurdity of his suspicion.</p>

            <p>“But I— you know — I don’t belong to any circle. I . . . .”</p>

            <p>He dared not say any more. Neither dared he mend his pace. The other, raising and
                setting down his lamentably shod feet with exact deliberation, protested in a low
                tone that it was not necessary for everybody to belong to an organization. The most
                valuable personalities remained outside. Some of the best work was done outside the
                organization. Then very fast, with whispering, feverish lips —</p>

            <p>“The man arrested in the street was Haldin.”</p>

            <p>And accepting Razumov’s dismayed silence as natural enough, he assured him that there
                was no mistake. That Government clerk was on night duty at the Secretariat. Hearing
                a great noise of footsteps in the hall and aware that political prisoners were
                brought over sometimes at night from the fortress, he opened the door of the room in
                which he was working, suddenly. Before the gendarme on duty could push him back and
                slam the door in his face, he had seen a prisoner being partly carried, partly
                dragged along the hall by a lot of policemen. He was being used very brutally. And
                the clerk had recognized Haldin perfectly. Less than half an hour afterwards General
                T—— arrived at the Secretariat to examine that prisoner personally.</p>

            <p>“Aren’t you astonished?” concluded the gaunt student.</p>

            <p>“No,” said Razumov roughly — and at once regretted his answer.</p>

            <p>“Everybody supposed Haldin was in the provinces — with his people. Didn’t you? ”</p>

            <p>The student turned his big hollow eyes upon Razumov, who said unguardedly —</p>

            <p>“His people are abroad.”</p>

            <p>He could have bitten his tongue out with vexation. The student pronounced in a tone
                of profound meaning-</p>

            <p>“So! You alone were aware. . .” and stopped.</p>

            <p>“They have sworn my ruin,” thought Razumov.” Have you spoken of this to anyone else?”
                he asked with bitter curiosity.</p>

            <p>The other shook his head.</p>

            <p>“No, only to you. Our circle thought that as Haldin had been often heard expressing a
                warm appreciation of your character . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov could not restrain a gesture of angry despair which the other must have
                misunderstood in some way, because he ceased speaking and turned away his black,
                lack-lustre eyes.</p>

            <p>They moved side by side in silence. Then the gaunt student began to whisper again,
                with averted gaze —</p>

            <p>“As we have at present no one affiliated inside the fortress so as to make it
                possible to furnish him with a packet of poison, we have considered already some
                sort of retaliatory action — to follow very soon . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov trudging on interrupted —</p>

            <p>“Were you acquainted with Haldin? Did he know where you live?”</p>

            <p>“I had the happiness to hear him speak twice,” his companion answered in the feverish
                whisper contrasting with the gloomy apathy of his face and bearing. “He did not know
                where I live. . . . I am lodging poorly with an artisan family. . . . I have just a
                corner in a room. It is not very practicable to see me there, but if you should need
                me for anything I am ready . . . .</p>

            <p>Razumov trembled with rage and fear. He was beside himself, but kept his voice
                low.</p>

            <p>“You are not to come near me. You are not to speak to me. Never address a single word
                to me. I forbid you.”</p>

            <p>“Very well,” said the other submissively, showing no surprise whatever at this abrupt
                prohibition. “You don’t wish for secret reasons . . . perfectly . . . I
                understand.”</p>

            <p>He edged away at once, not looking up even; and Razumov saw his gaunt, shabby,
                famine-stricken figure cross the street obliquely with lowered head and that
                peculiar exact motion of the feet.</p>

            <p>He watched him as one would watch a vision out of a nightmare, then he continued on
                his way, trying not to think. On his landing the landlady seemed to be waiting for
                him. She was a short, thick, shapeless woman with a large yellow face wrapped up
                everlastingly in a black woollen shawl. When she saw him come up the last flight of
                stairs she flung both her arms up excitedly, then clasped her hands before her
                face.</p>

            <p>“Kirylo Sidorovitch — little father — what have you been doing? And such a quiet
                young man, too! The police are just gone this moment after searching your
                rooms.”</p>

            <p>Razumov gazed down at her with silent, scrutinizing attention. Her puffy yellow
                countenance was working with emotion. She screwed up her eyes at him
                entreatingly.</p>

            <p>“Such a sensible young man! Anybody can see you are sensible. And now — like this —
                all at once. . . . What is the good of mixing yourself up with these Nihilists? Do
                give over, little father. They are unlucky people.”</p>

            <p>Razumov moved his shoulders slightly.</p>

            <p>“Or is it that some secret enemy has been calumniating you, Kirylo Sidorovitch? The
                world is full of black hearts and false denunciations nowadays. There is much fear
                about.”</p>

            <p>“Have you heard that I have been denounced by some one?” asked Razumov, without
                taking his eyes off her quivering face.</p>

            <p>But she had not heard anything. She had tried to find out by asking the police
                captain while his men were turning the room upside down. The police captain of the
                district had known her for the last eleven years and was a humane person. But he
                said to her on the landing, looking very black and vexed —</p>

            <p>“My good woman, do not ask questions. I don’t know anything myself. The order comes
                from higher quarters.”</p>

            <p>And indeed there had appeared, shortly after the arrival of the policemen of the
                district, a very superior gentleman in a fur coat and a shiny hat, who sat down in
                the room and looked through all the papers himself. He came alone and went away by
                himself, taking nothing with him. She had been trying to put things straight a
                little since they left.</p>

            <p>Razumov turned away brusquely and entered his rooms.</p>

            <p>All his books had been shaken and thrown on the floor. His landlady followed him, and
                stooping painfully began to pick them up into her apron. His papers and notes which
                were kept always neatly sorted (they all related to his studies) had been shuffled
                up and heaped together into a ragged pile in the middle of the table.</p>

            <p>This disorder affected him profoundly, unreasonably. He sat down and stared. He had a
                distinct sensation of his very existence being undermined in some mysterious manner,
                of his moral supports falling away from him one by one. He even experienced a slight
                physical giddiness and made a movement as if to reach for something to steady
                himself with.</p>

            <p>The old woman, rising to her feet with a low groan, shot all the books she had
                collected in her apron on to the sofa and left the room muttering and sighing.</p>

            <p>It was only then that he noticed that the sheet of paper which for one night had
                remained stabbed to the wall above his empty bed was lying on top of the pile.</p>

            <p>When he had taken it down the day before he had folded it in four, absent-mindedly,
                before dropping it on the table. And now he saw it lying uppermost, spread out,
                smoothed out even and covering all the confused pile of pages, the record of his
                intellectual life for the last three years. It had not been flung there. It had been
                placed there — smoothed out, too! He guessed in that an intention of profound
                meaning- -or perhaps some inexplicable mockery.</p>

            <p>He sat staring at the piece of paper till his eyes began to smart. He did not attempt
                to put his papers in order, either that evening or the next day — which he spent at
                home in a state of peculiar irresolution. This irresolution bore upon the question
                whether he should continue to live — neither more nor less. But its nature was very
                far removed from the hesitation of a man contemplating suicide. The idea of laying
                violent hands upon his body did not occur to Razumov. The unrelated organism bearing
                that label, walking, breathing, wearing these clothes, was of no importance to
                anyone, unless maybe to the landlady. The true Razumov had his being in the willed,
                in the determined future — in that future menaced by the lawlessness of autocracy —
                for autocracy knows no law — and the lawlessness of revolution. The feeling that his
                moral personality was at the mercy of these lawless forces was so strong that he
                asked himself seriously if it were worth while to go on accomplishing the mental
                functions of that existence which seemed no longer his own.</p>

            <p>“What is the good of exerting my intelligence, of pursuing the systematic development
                of my faculties and all my plans of work?” he asked himself. “I want to guide my
                conduct by reasonable convictions, but what security have I against something — some
                destructive horror — walking in upon me as I sit here?. . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked apprehensively towards the door of the outer room as if expecting some
                shape of evil to turn the handle and appear before him silently.</p>

            <p>“A common thief,” he said to himself,” finds more guarantees in the law he is
                breaking, and even a brute like Ziemianitch has his consolation.” Razumov envied the
                materialism of the thief and the passion of the incorrigible lover. The consequences
                of their actions were always clear and their lives remained their own.</p>

            <p>But he slept as soundly that night as though he had been consoling himself in the
                manner of Ziemianitch. He dropped off suddenly, lay like a log, remembered no dream
                on waking. But it was as if his soul had gone out in the night to gather the flowers
                of wrathful wisdom. He got up in a mood of grim determination and as if with a new
                knowledge of his own nature. He looked mockingly on the heap of papers on his table;
                and left his room to attend the lectures, muttering to himself, “We shall see.”</p>

            <p>He was in no humour to talk to anybody or hear himself questioned as to his absence
                from lectures the day before. But it was difficult to repulse rudely a very good
                comrade with a smooth pink face and fair hair, bearing the nickname amongst his
                fellow-students of “Madcap Kostia.” He was the idolized only son of a very wealthy
                and illiterate Government contractor, and attended the lectures only during the
                periodical fits of contrition following upon tearful paternal remonstrances. Noisily
                blundering like a retriever puppy, his elated voice and great gestures filled the
                bare academy corridors with the joy of thoughtless animal life, provoking indulgent
                smiles at a great distance. His usual discourses treated of trotting horses,
                wine-parties in expensive restaurants, and the merits of persons of easy virtue,
                with a disarming artlessness of outlook. He pounced upon Razumov about midday,
                somewhat less uproariously than his habit was, and led him aside.</p>

            <p>“Just a moment, Kirylo Sidorovitch. A few words here in this quiet corner.”</p>

            <p>He felt Razumov’s reluctance, and insinuated his hand under his arm caressingly.</p>

            <p>“No — pray do. I don’t want to talk to you about any of my silly scrapes. What are my
                scrapes? Absolutely nothing. Mere childishness. The other night I flung a fellow out
                of a certain place where I was having a fairly good time. A tyrannical little beast
                of a quill-driver from the Treasury department. He was bullying the people of the
                house. I rebuked him. ‘You are not behaving humanely to God’s creatures that are a
                jolly sight more estimable than yourself,’ I said. I can’t bear to see any tyranny,
                Kirylo Sidorovitch. Upon my word I can’t. He didn’t take it in good part at all.
                ‘Who’s that impudent puppy?’ he begins to shout. I was in excellent form as it
                happened, and he went through the closed window very suddenly. He flew quite a long
                way into the yard. I raged like — like a — minotaur. The women clung to me and
                screamed, the fiddlers got under the table. . . . Such fun! My dad had to put his
                hand pretty deep into his pocket, I can tell you.” He chuckled.</p>

            <p>“My dad is a very useful man. Jolly good thing it is for me, too. I do get into
                unholy scrapes.”</p>

            <p>His elation fell. That was just it. What was his life? Insignificant; no good to
                anyone; a mere festivity. It would end some fine day in his getting his skull split
                with a champagne bottle in a drunken brawl. At such times, too, when men were
                sacrificing themselves to ideas. But he could never get any ideas into his head. His
                head wasn’t worth anything better than to be split by a champagne bottle.</p>

            <p>Razumov, protesting that he had no time, made an attempt to get away. The other’s
                tone changed to confidential earnestness.</p>

            <p>“For God’s sake, Kirylo, my dear soul, let me make some sort of sacrifice. It would
                not be a sacrifice really. I have my rich dad behind me. There’s positively no
                getting to the bottom of his pocket.”</p>

            <p>And rejecting indignantly Razumov’s suggestion that this was drunken raving, he
                offered to lend him some money to escape abroad with. He could always get money from
                his dad. He had only to say that he had lost it at cards or something of that sort,
                and at the same time promise solemnly not to miss a single lecture for three months
                on end. That would fetch the old man; and he, Kostia, was quite equal to the
                sacrifice. Though he really did not see what was the good for him to attend the
                lectures. It was perfectly hopeless.</p>

            <p>“Won’t you let me be of some use?” he pleaded to the silent Razumov, who with his
                eyes on the ground and utterly unable to penetrate the real drift of the other’s
                intention, felt a strange reluctance to clear up the point.</p>

            <p>“What makes you think I want to go abroad?” he asked at last very quietly.</p>

            <p>Kostia lowered his voice.</p>

            <p>“You had the police in your rooms yesterday. There are three or four of us who have
                heard of that. Never mind how we know. It is sufficient that we do. So we have been
                consulting together.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! You got to know that so soon,” muttered Razumov negligently.</p>

            <p>“Yes. We did. And it struck us that a man like you . . . ”</p>

            <p>“What sort of a man do you take me to be?” Razumov interrupted him.</p>

            <p>“A man of ideas — and a man of action too. But you are very deep, Kirylo. There’s no
                getting to the bottom of your mind. Not for fellows like me. But we all agreed that
                you must be preserved for our country. Of that we have no doubt whatever — I mean
                all of us who have heard Haldin speak of you on certain occasions. A man doesn’t get
                the police ransacking his rooms without there being some devilry hanging over his
                head. . . . And so if you think that it would be better for you to bolt at once
                . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov tore himself away and walked down the corridor, leaving the other motionless
                with his mouth open. But almost at once he returned and stood before the amazed
                Kostia, who shut his mouth slowly. Razumov looked him straight in the eyes, before
                saying with marked deliberation and separating his words-</p>

            <p>“I thank — you — very — much.”</p>

            <p>He went away again rapidly. Kostia, recovering from his surprise at these manoeuvres,
                ran up behind him pressingly.</p>

            <p>“No! Wait! Listen. I really mean it. It would be like giving your compassion to a
                starving fellow. Do you hear, Kirylo? And any disguise you may think of, that too I
                could procure from a costumier, a Jew I know. Let a fool be made serviceable
                according to his folly. Perhaps also a false beard or something of that kind may be
                needed.</p>

            <p>“Razumov turned at bay.</p>

            <p>“There are no false beards needed in this business, Kostia — you good-hearted
                lunatic, you. What do you know of my ideas? My ideas may be poison to you.” The
                other began to shake his head in energetic protest.</p>

            <p>“What have you got to do with ideas? Some of them would make an end of your dad’s
                money-bags. Leave off meddling with what you don’t understand. Go back to your
                trotting horses and your girls, and then you’ll be sure at least of doing no harm to
                anybody, and hardly any to yourself.”</p>

            <p>The enthusiastic youth was overcome by this disdain.</p>

            <p>“You’re sending me back to my pig’s trough, Kirylo. That settles it. I am an unlucky
                beast- -and I shall die like a beast too. But mind — it’s your contempt that has
                done for me.”</p>

            <p>Razumov went off with long strides. That this simple and grossly festive soul should
                have fallen too under the revolutionary curse affected him as an ominous symptom of
                the time. He reproached himself for feeling troubled. Personally he ought to have
                felt reassured. There was an obvious advantage in this conspiracy of mistaken
                judgment taking him for what he was not. But was it not strange?</p>

            <p>Again he experienced that sensation of his conduct being taken out of his hands by
                Haldin’s revolutionary tyranny. His solitary and laborious existence had been
                destroyed — the only thing he could call his own on this earth. By what right? he
                asked himself furiously. In what name?</p>

            <p>What infuriated him most was to feel that the “thinkers” of the University were
                evidently connecting him with Haldin — as a sort of confidant in the background
                apparently. A mysterious connexion! Ha ha! . . . He had been made a personage
                without knowing anything about it. How that wretch Haldin must have talked about
                him! Yet it was likely that Haldin had said very little. The fellow’s casual
                utterances were caught up and treasured and pondered over by all these imbeciles.
                And was not all secret revolutionary action based upon folly, self-deception, and
                lies?</p>

            <p>“Impossible to think of anything else,” muttered Razumov to himself. “I’ll become an
                idiot if this goes on. The scoundrels and the fools are murdering my
                intelligence.”</p>

            <p>He lost all hope of saving his future, which depended on the free use of his
                intelligence.</p>

            <p>He reached the doorway of his house in a state of mental discouragement which enabled
                him to receive with apparent indifference an official- looking envelope from the
                dirty hand of the dvornik.</p>

            <p>“A gendarme brought it,” said the man. “ He asked if you were at home. I told him
                ‘No, he’s not at home.’ So he left it. ‘Give it into his own hands,’ says he. Now
                you’ve got it — eh?”</p>

            <p>He went back to his sweeping, and Razumov climbed his stairs, envelope in hand. Once
                in his room he did not hasten to open it. Of course this official missive was from
                the superior direction of the police. A suspect! A suspect!</p>

            <p>He stared in dreary astonishment at the absurdity of his position. He thought with a
                sort of dry, unemotional melancholy; three years of good work gone, the course of
                forty more perhaps jeopardized — turned from hope to terror, because events started
                by human folly link themselves into a sequence which no sagacity can foresee and no
                courage can break through. Fatality enters your rooms while your landlady’s back is
                turned; you come home and find it in possession bearing a man’s name, clothed in
                flesh — wearing a brown cloth coat and long boots- -lounging against the stove. It
                asks you, “Is the outer door closed?”— and you don’t know enough to take it by the
                throat and fling it downstairs. You don’t know. You welcome the crazy fate. “Sit
                down,” you say. And it is all over. You cannot shake it off any more. It will cling
                to you for ever. Neither halter nor bullet can give you back the freedom of your
                life and the sanity of your thought. . . . It was enough to dash one’s head against
                a wall.</p>

            <p>Razumov looked slowly all round the walls as if to select a spot to dash his head
                against. Then he opened the letter. It directed the student Kirylo Sidorovitch
                Razumov to present himself without delay at the General Secretariat.</p>

            <p>Razumov had a vision of General T——‘s goggle eyes waiting for him — the embodied
                power of autocracy, grotesque and terrible. He embodied the whole power of autocracy
                because he was its guardian. He was the incarnate suspicion, the incarnate anger,
                the incarnate ruthlessness of a political and social regime on its defence. He
                loathed rebellion by instinct. And Razumov reflected that the man was simply unable
                to understand a reasonable adherence to the doctrine of absolutism.</p>

            <p>“What can he want with me precisely — I wonder?” he asked himself.</p>

            <p>As if that mental question had evoked the familiar phantom, Haldin stood suddenly
                before him in the room with an extraordinary completeness of detail. Though the
                short winter day had passed already into the sinister twilight of a land buried in
                snow, Razumov saw plainly the narrow leather strap round the Tcherkess coat. The
                illusion of that hateful presence was so perfect that he half expected it to ask,
                “Is the outer door closed?” He looked at it with hatred and contempt. Souls do not
                take a shape of clothing. Moreover, Haldin could not be dead yet. Razumov stepped
                forward menacingly; the vision vanished — and turning short on his heel he walked
                out of his room with infinite disdain.</p>

            <p>But after going down the first flight of stairs it occurred to him that perhaps the
                superior authorities of police meant to confront him with Haldin in the flesh. This
                thought struck him like a bullet, and had he not clung with both hands to the
                banister he would have rolled down to the next landing most likely. His legs were of
                no use for a considerable time . . . . But why? For what conceivable reason? To what
                end?</p>

            <p>There could be no rational answer to these questions; but Razumov remembered the
                promise made by the General to Prince K——. His action was to remain unknown.</p>

            <p>He got down to the bottom of the stairs, lowering himself as it were from step to
                step, by the banister. Under the gate he regained much of his firmness of thought
                and limb. He went out into the street without staggering visibly. Every moment he
                felt steadier mentally. And yet he was saying to himself that General T—— was
                perfectly capable of shutting him up in the fortress for an indefinite time. His
                temperament fitted his remorseless task, and his omnipotence made him inaccessible
                to reasonable argument.</p>

            <p>But when Razumov arrived at the Secretariat he discovered that he would have nothing
                to do with General T——. It is evident from Mr. Razumov’s diary that this dreaded
                personality was to remain in the background. A civilian of superior rank received
                him in a private room after a period of waiting in outer offices where a lot of
                scribbling went on at many tables in a heated and stuffy atmosphere.</p>

            <p>The clerk in uniform who conducted him said in the corridor —</p>

            <p>“You are going before Gregor Matvieitch Mikulin.”</p>

            <p>There was nothing formidable about the man bearing that name. His mild, expectant
                glance was turned on the door already when Razumov entered. At once, with the
                penholder he was holding in his hand, he pointed to a deep sofa between two windows.
                He followed Razumov with his eyes while that last crossed the room and sat down. The
                mild gaze rested on him, not curious, not inquisitive — certainly not suspicious —
                almost without expression. In its passionless persistence there was something
                resembling sympathy.</p>

            <p>Razumov, who had prepared his will and his intelligence to encounter General T——
                himself, was profoundly troubled. All the moral bracing up against the possible
                excesses of power and passion went for nothing before this sallow man, who wore a
                full unclipped beard. It was fair, thin, and very fine. The light fell in coppery
                gleams on the protuberances of a high, rugged forehead. And the aspect of the broad,
                soft physiognomy was so homely and rustic that the careful middle parting of the
                hair seemed a pretentious affectation.</p>

            <p>The diary of Mr. Razumov testifies to some irritation on his part. I may remark here
                that the diary proper consisting of the more or less daily entries seems to have
                been begun on that very evening after Mr. Razumov had returned home.</p>

            <p>Mr. Razumov, then, was irritated. His strung-up individuality had gone to pieces
                within him very suddenly.</p>

            <p>“I must be very prudent with him,” he warned himself in the silence during which they
                sat gazing at each other. It lasted some little time, and was characterized (for
                silences have their character) by a sort of sadness imparted to it perhaps by the
                mild and thoughtful manner of the bearded official. Razumov learned later that he
                was the chief of a department in the General Secretariat, with a rank in the civil
                service equivalent to that of a colonel in the army.</p>

            <p>Razumov’s mistrust became acute. The main point was, not to be drawn into saying too
                much. He had been called there for some reason. What reason? To be given to
                understand that he was a suspect — and also no doubt to be pumped. As to what
                precisely? There was nothing. Or perhaps Haldin had been telling lies. . . . Every
                alarming uncertainty beset Razumov. He could bear the silence no longer, and cursing
                himself for his weakness spoke first, though he had promised himself not to do so on
                any account.</p>

            <p>“I haven’t lost a moment’s time,” he began in a hoarse, provoking tone; and then the
                faculty of speech seemed to leave him and enter the body of Councillor Mikulin, who
                chimed in approvingly —</p>

            <p>“Very proper. Very proper. Though as a matter of fact . . . .”</p>

            <p>But the spell was broken, and Razumov interrupted him boldly, under a sudden
                conviction that this was the safest attitude to take. With a great flow of words he
                complained of being totally misunderstood. Even as he talked with a perception of
                his own audacity he thought that the word “misunderstood” was better than the word
                “mistrusted,” and he repeated it again with insistence. Suddenly he ceased, being
                seized with fright before the attentive immobility of the official. “What am I
                talking about?” he thought, eyeing him with a vague gaze. Mistrusted — not
                misunderstood — was the right symbol for these people. Misunderstood was the other
                kind of curse. Both had been brought on his head by that fellow Haldin. And his head
                ached terribly. He passed his hand over his brow — an involuntary gesture of
                suffering, which he was too careless to restrain. At that moment Razumov beheld his
                own brain suffering on the rack — a long, pale figure drawn asunder horizontally
                with terrific force in the darkness of a vault, whose face he failed to see. It was
                as though he had dreamed for an infinitesimal fraction of time of some dark print of
                the Inquisition.</p>

            <p>It is not to be seriously supposed that Razumov had actually dozed off and had
                dreamed in the presence of Councillor Mikulin, of an old print of the Inquisition.
                He was indeed extremely exhausted, and he records a remarkably dream- like
                experience of anguish at the circumstance that there was no one whatever near the
                pale and extended figure. The solitude of the racked victim was particularly
                horrible to behold. The mysterious impossibility to see the face, he also notes,
                inspired a sort of terror. All these characteristics of an ugly dream were present.
                Yet he is certain that he never lost the consciousness of himself on the sofa,
                leaning forward with his hands between his knees and turning his cap round and round
                in his fingers. But everything vanished at the voice of Councillor Mikulin. Razumov
                felt profoundly grateful for the even simplicity of its tone.</p>

            <p>“Yes. I have listened with interest. I comprehend in a measure your . . . But,
                indeed, you are mistaken in what you . . . . “Councillor Mikulin uttered a series of
                broken sentences. Instead of finishing them he glanced down his beard. It was a
                deliberate curtailment which somehow made the phrases more impressive. But he could
                talk fluently enough, as became apparent when changing his tone to persuasiveness he
                went on: “By listening to you as I did, I think I have proved that I do not regard
                our intercourse as strictly official. In fact, I don’t want it to have that
                character at all. . . . Oh yes! I admit that the request for your presence here had
                an official form. But I put it to you whether it was a form which would have been
                used to secure the attendance of a . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Suspect,” exclaimed Razumov, looking straight into the official’s eyes. They were
                big with heavy eyelids, and met his boldness with a dim, steadfast gaze. “A
                suspect.” The open repetition of that word which had been haunting all his waking
                hours gave Razumov a strange sort of satisfaction. Councillor Mikulin shook his head
                slightly. “Surely you do know that I’ve had my rooms searched by the police?”</p>

            <p>“I was about to say a ‘misunderstood person,’ when you interrupted me,” insinuated
                quietly Councillor Mikulin.</p>

            <p>Razumov smiled without bitterness. The renewed sense of his intellectual superiority
                sustained him in the hour of danger. He said a little disdainfully —</p>

            <p>“I know I am but a reed. But I beg you to allow me the superiority of the thinking
                reed over the unthinking forces that are about to crush him out of existence.
                Practical thinking in the last instance is but criticism. I may perhaps be allowed
                to express my wonder at this action of the police being delayed for two full days
                during which, of course, I could have annihilated everything compromising by burning
                it — let us say — and getting rid of the very ashes, for that matter.”</p>

            <p>“You are angry,” remarked the official, with an unutterable simplicity of tone and
                manner. “Is that reasonable? ”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt himself colouring with annoyance.</p>

            <p>“I am reasonable. I am even — permit me to say — a thinker, though to be sure, this
                name nowadays seems to be the monopoly of hawkers of revolutionary wares, the slaves
                of some French or German thought — devil knows what foreign notions. But I am not an
                intellectual mongrel. I think like a Russian. I think faithfully — and I take the
                liberty to call myself a thinker. It is not a forbidden word, as far as I know.”</p>

            <p>“No. Why should it be a forbidden word?” Councillor Mikulin turned in his seat with
                crossed legs and resting his elbow on the table propped his head on the knuckles of
                a half- closed hand. Razumov noticed a thick forefinger clasped by a massive gold
                band set with a blood- red stone — a signet ring that, looking as if it could weigh
                half a pound, was an appropriate ornament for that ponderous man with the accurate
                middle-parting of glossy hair above a rugged Socratic forehead.</p>

            <p>“Could it be a wig?” Razumov detected himself wondering with an unexpected
                detachment. His self-confidence was much shaken. He resolved to chatter no more.
                Reserve! Reserve! All he had to do was to keep the Ziemianitch episode secret with
                absolute determination, when the questions came. Keep Ziemianitch strictly out of
                all the answers.</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin looked at him dimly. Razumov’s self-confidence abandoned him
                completely. It seemed impossible to keep Ziemianitch out. Every question would lead
                to that, because, of course, there was nothing else. He made an effort to brace
                himself up. It was a failure. But Councillor Mikulin was surprisingly detached
                too.</p>

            <p>“Why should it be forbidden?” he repeated. “I too consider myself a thinking man, I
                assure you. The principal condition is to think correctly. I admit it is difficult
                sometimes at first for a young man abandoned to himself — with his generous impulses
                undisciplined, so to speak- -at the mercy of every wild wind that blows. Religious
                belief, of course, is a great . . . .”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin glanced down his beard, and Razumov, whose tension was relaxed by
                that unexpected and discursive turn, murmured with gloomy discontent-</p>

            <p>“That man, Haldin, believed in God.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! You are aware,” breathed out Councillor Mikulin, making the point softly, as if
                with discretion, but making it nevertheless plainly enough, as if he too were put
                off his guard by Razumov’s remark. The young man preserved an impassive, moody
                countenance, though he reproached himself bitterly for a pernicious fool, to have
                given thus an utterly false impression of intimacy. He kept his eyes on the floor.
                “I must positively hold my tongue unless I am obliged to speak,” he admonished
                himself. And at once against his will the question, “Hadn’t I better tell him
                everything?” presented itself with such force that he had to bite his lower lip.
                Councillor Mikulin could not, however, have nourished any hope of confession. He
                went on —</p>

            <p>“You tell me more than his judges were able to get out of him. He was judged by a
                commission of three. He would tell them absolutely nothing. I have the report of the
                interrogatories here, by me. After every question there stands “Refuses to answer —
                refuses to answer.’ It’s like that page after page. You see, I have been entrusted
                with some further investigations around and about this affair. He has left me
                nothing to begin my investigations on. A hardened miscreant. And so, you say, he
                believed in . . . .”</p>

            <p>Again Councillor Mikulin glanced down his beard with a faint grimace; but he did not
                pause for long. Remarking with a shade of scorn that blasphemers also had that sort
                of belief, he concluded by supposing that Mr. Razumov had conversed frequently with
                Haldin on the subject.</p>

            <p>“No,” said Razumov loudly, without looking up. “He talked and I listened. That is not
                a conversation.”</p>

            <p>“Listening is a great art,” observed Mikulin parenthetically.</p>

            <p>“And getting people to talk is another,” mumbled Razumov.</p>

            <p>“Well, no — that is not very difficult,” Mikulin said innocently, “except, of course,
                in special cases. For instance, this Haldin. Nothing could induce him to talk. He
                was brought four times before the delegated judges. Four secret interrogatories —
                and even during the last, when your personality was put forward . . . .”</p>

            <p>“My personality put forward?” repeated Razumov, raising his head brusquely. “I don’t
                understand.” Councillor Mikulin turned squarely to the table, and taking up some
                sheets of grey foolscap dropped them one after another, retaining only the last in
                his hand. He held it before his eyes while speaking.</p>

            <p>“It was — you see — judged necessary. In a case of that gravity no means of action
                upon the culprit should be neglected. You understand that yourself, I am
                certain.”</p>

            <p>Razumov stared with enormous wide eyes at the side view of Councillor Mikulin, who
                now was not looking at him at all.</p>

            <p>“So it was decided (I was consulted by General T- —) that a certain question should
                be put to the accused. But in deference to the earnest wishes of Prince K—— your
                name has been kept out of the documents and even from the very knowledge of the
                judges themselves. Prince K—— recognized the propriety, the necessity of what we
                proposed to do, but he was concerned for your safety. Things do leak out — that we
                can’t deny. One cannot always answer for the discretion of inferior officials. There
                was, of course, the secretary of the special tribunal — one or two gendarmes in the
                room. Moreover, as I have said, in deference to Prince K—— even the judges
                themselves were to be left in ignorance. The question ready framed was sent to them
                by General T—— (I wrote it out with my own hand) with instructions to put it to the
                prisoner the very last of all. Here it is.”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin threw back his head into proper focus and went on reading
                monotonously: “Question — Has the man well known to you, in whose rooms you remained
                for several hours on Monday and on whose information you have been arrested — has he
                had any previous knowledge of your intention to commit a political murder? . . .
                Prisoner refuses to reply.</p>

            <p>“Question repeated. Prisoner preserves the same stubborn silence.</p>

            <p>“The venerable Chaplain of the Fortress being then admitted and exhorting the
                prisoner to repentance, entreating him also to atone for his crime by an unreserved
                and full confession which should help to liberate from the sin of rebellion against
                the Divine laws and the sacred Majesty of the Ruler, our Christ-loving land — the
                prisoner opens his lips for the first time during this morning’s audience and in a
                loud, clear voice rejects the venerable Chaplain’s ministrations.</p>

            <p>“At eleven o’clock the Court pronounces in summary form the death sentence.</p>

            <p>“The execution is fixed for four o’clock in the afternoon, subject to further
                instructions from superior authorities.”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin dropped the page of foolscap, glanced down his beard, and turning
                to Razumov, added in an easy, explanatory tone —</p>

            <p>“We saw no object in delaying the execution. The order to carry out the sentence was
                sent by telegraph at noon. I wrote out the telegram myself. He was hanged at four
                o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

            <p>The definite information of Haldin’s death gave Razumov the feeling of general
                lassitude which follows a great exertion or a great excitement. He kept very still
                on the sofa, but a murmur escaped him-</p>

            <p>“He had a belief in a future existence.”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin shrugged his shoulders slightly, and Razumov got up with an
                effort. There was nothing now to stay for in that room. Haldin had been hanged at
                four o’clock. There could be no doubt of that. He had, it seemed, entered upon his
                future existence, long boots, Astrakhan fur cap and all, down to the very leather
                strap round his waist. A flickering, vanishing sort of existence. It was not his
                soul, it was his mere phantom he had left behind on this earth — thought Razumov,
                smiling caustically to himself while he crossed the room, utterly forgetful of where
                he was and of Councillor Mikulin’s existence. The official could have set a lot of
                bells ringing all over the building without leaving his chair. He let Razumov go
                quite up to the door before he spoke.</p>

            <p>“Come, Kirylo Sidorovitch — what are you doing?”</p>

            <p>Razumov turned his head and looked at him in silence. He was not in the least
                disconcerted. Councillor Mikulin’s arms were stretched out on the table before him
                and his body leaned forward a little with an effort of his dim gaze.</p>

            <p>“Was I actually going to clear out like this?” Razumov wondered at himself with an
                impassive countenance. And he was aware of this impassiveness concealing a lucid
                astonishment.</p>

            <p>“Evidently I was going out if he had not spoken,” he thought. “What would he have
                done then? I must end this affair one way or another. I must make him show his
                hand.”</p>

            <p>For a moment longer he reflected behind the mask as it were, then let go the
                door-handle and came back to the middle of the room.</p>

            <p>“I’ll tell you what you think,” he said explosively, but not raising his voice. “You
                think that you are dealing with a secret accomplice of that unhappy man. No, I do
                not know that he was unhappy. He did not tell me. He was a wretch from my point of
                view, because to keep alive a false idea is a greater crime than to kill a man. I
                suppose you will not deny that? I hated him! Visionaries work everlasting evil on
                earth. Their Utopias inspire in the mass of mediocre minds a disgust of reality and
                a contempt for the secular logic of human development.”</p>

            <p>Razumov shrugged his shoulders and stared. “What a tirade!” he thought. The silence
                and immobility of Councillor Mikulin impressed him. The bearded bureaucrat sat at
                his post, mysteriously self-possessed like an idol with dim, unreadable eyes.
                Razumov’s voice changed involuntarily.</p>

            <p>“If you were to ask me where is the necessity of my hate for such as Haldin, I would
                answer you — there is nothing sentimental in it. I did not hate him because he had
                committed the crime of murder. Abhorrence is not hate. I hated him simply because I
                am sane. It is in that character that he outraged me. His death. . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt his voice growing thick in his throat. The dimness of Councillor
                Mikulin’s eyes seemed to spread all over his face and made it indistinct to
                Razumov’s sight. He tried to disregard these phenomena.</p>

            <p>“Indeed,” he pursued, pronouncing each word carefully, “what is his death to me? If
                he were lying here on the floor I could walk over his breast. . . . The fellow is a
                mere phantom . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov’s voice died out very much against his will. Mikulin behind the table did not
                allow himself the slightest movement. The silence lasted for some little time before
                Razumov could go on again.</p>

            <p>“He went about talking of me. Those intellectual fellows sit in each other’s rooms
                and get drunk on foreign ideas in the same way young Guards’ officers treat each
                other with foreign wines. Merest debauchery. . . . Upon my Word,”— Razumov, enraged
                by a sudden recollection of Ziemianitch, lowered his voice forcibly — “upon my word,
                we Russians are a drunken lot. Intoxication of some sort we must have: to get
                ourselves wild with sorrow or maudlin with resignation; to lie inert like a log or
                set fire to the house. What is a sober man to do, I should like to know? To cut
                oneself entirely from one’s kind is impossible. To live in a desert one must be a
                saint. But if a drunken man runs out of the grog-shop, falls on your neck and kisses
                you on both cheeks because something about your appearance has taken his fancy, what
                then — kindly tell me? You may break, perhaps, a cudgel on his back and yet not
                succeed in beating him off . . . .”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin raised his hand and passed it down his face deliberately.</p>

            <p>“That’s . . . of course,” he said in an undertone.</p>

            <p>The quiet gravity of that gesture made Razumov pause. It was so unexpected, too. What
                did it mean? It had an alarming aloofness. Razumov remembered his intention of
                making him show his hand.</p>

            <p>“I have said all this to Prince K— — ” he began with assumed indifference, but lost
                it on seeing Councillor Mikulin’s slow nod of assent. “You know it? You’ve heard.
                . . . Then why should I be called here to be told of Haldin’s execution? Did you
                want to confront me with his silence now that the man is dead? What is his silence
                to me! This is incomprehensible. “You want in some way to shake my moral
                balance.”</p>

            <p>“No. Not that,” murmured Councillor Mikulin, just audibly. “The service you have
                rendered is appreciated . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Is it?’’ interrupted Razumov ironically.</p>

            <p>“. . .and your position too.” Councillor Mikulin did not raise his voice. “But only
                think! You fall into Prince K——‘s study as if from the sky with your startling
                information. . . . You are studying yet, Mr. Razumov, but we are serving already —
                don’t forget that. . . . And naturally some curiosity was bound to . . . .”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin looked down his beard. Razumov’s lips trembled.</p>

            <p>“An occurrence of that sort marks a man,” the homely murmur went on. “I admit I was
                curious to see you. General T—— thought it would be useful, too. . . . Don’t think I
                am incapable of understanding your sentiments. When I was young like you I studied
                . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes — you wished to see me,” said Razumov in a tone of profound distaste. “Naturally
                you have the right — I mean the power. It all amounts to the same thing. But it is
                perfectly useless, if you were to look at me and listen to me for a year. I begin to
                think there is something about me which people don’t seem able to make out. It’s
                unfortunate. I imagine, however, that Prince K—— understands. He seemed to.”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin moved slightly and spoke.</p>

            <p>“Prince K—— is aware of everything that is being done, and I don’t mind informing you
                that he approved my intention of becoming personally acquainted with you.”</p>

            <p>Razumov concealed an immense disappointment under the accents of railing
                surprise.</p>

            <p>“So he is curious too! . . . Well — after all, Prince K—— knows me very little. It is
                really very unfortunate for me, but — it is not exactly my fault.”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin raised a hasty deprecatory hand and inclined his head slightly
                over his shoulder.</p>

            <p>“Now, Mr. Razumov — is it necessary to take it in that way? Everybody I am sure can
                . . . .”</p>

            <p>He glanced rapidly down his beard, and when he looked up again there was for a moment
                an interested expression in his misty gaze. Razumov discouraged it with a cold,
                repellent smile.</p>

            <p>“No. That’s of no importance to be sure — except that in respect of all this
                curiosity being aroused by a very simple matter. . . . What is to be done with it?
                It is unappeasable. I mean to say there is nothing to appease it with. I happen to
                have been born a Russian with patriotic instincts — whether inherited or not I am
                not in a position to say.”</p>

            <p>Razumov spoke consciously with elaborate steadiness.</p>

            <p>“Yes, patriotic instincts developed by a faculty of independent thinking — of
                detached thinking. In that respect I am more free than any social democratic
                revolution could make me. It is more than probable that I don’t think exactly as you
                are thinking. Indeed, how could it be? You would think most likely at this moment
                that I am elaborately lying to cover up the track of my repentance.”</p>

            <p>Razumov stopped. His heart had grown too big for his breast. Councillor Mikulin did
                not flinch.</p>

            <p>“Why so?” he said simply. “I assisted personally at the search of your rooms. I
                looked through all the papers myself. I have been greatly impressed by a sort of
                political confession of faith. A very remarkable document. Now may I ask for what
                purpose . . . .”</p>

            <p>“To deceive the police naturally,” said Razumov savagely. . . . “What is all this
                mockery? Of course you can send me straight from this room to Siberia. That would be
                intelligible. To what is intelligible I can submit. But I protest against this
                comedy of persecution. The whole affair is becoming too comical altogether for my
                taste. A comedy of errors, phantoms, and suspicions. It’s positively indecent . . .
                .”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin turned an attentive ear. “Did you say phantoms?” he murmured.</p>

            <p>“I could walk over dozens of them.” Razumov, with an impatient wave of his hand, went
                on headlong, “But, really, I must claim the right to be done once for all with that
                man. And in order to accomplish this I shall take the liberty . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov on his side of the table bowed slightly to the seated bureaucrat.</p>

            <p>“ . . . To retire — simply to retire,” he finished with great resolution.</p>

            <p>He walked to the door, thinking, “Now he must show his hand. He must ring and have me
                arrested before I am out of the building, or he must let me go. And either way . . .
                .”</p>

            <p>An unhurried voice said —</p>

            <p>“Kirylo Sidorovitch.” Razumov at the door turned his head.</p>

            <p>“To retire,” he repeated.</p>

            <p>“Where to?” asked Councillor Mikulin softly.</p>

            <head>PART SECOND</head>

            <head>1</head>


            <p>In the conduct of an invented story there are, no doubt, certain proprieties to be
                observed for the sake of clearness and effect. A man of imagination, however
                inexperienced in the art of narrative, has his instinct to guide him in the choice
                of his words, and in the development of the action. A grain of talent excuses many
                mistakes. But this is not a work of imagination; I have no talent; my excuse for
                this undertaking lies not in its art, but in its artlessness. Aware of my
                limitations and strong in the sincerity of my purpose, I would not try (were I able)
                to invent anything. I push my scruples so far that I would not even invent a
                transition.</p>

            <p>Dropping then Mr. Razumov’s record at the point where Councillor Mikulin’s question
                “Where to?” comes in with the force of an insoluble problem, I shall simply say that
                I made the acquaintance of these ladies about six months before that time. By “these
                ladies” I mean, of course, the mother and the sister of the unfortunate Haldin.</p>

            <p>By what arguments he had induced his mother to sell their little property and go
                abroad for an indefinite time, I cannot tell precisely. I have an idea that Mrs.
                Haldin, at her son’s wish, would have set fire to her house and emigrated to the
                moon without any sign of surprise or apprehension; and that Miss Haldin — Nathalie,
                caressingly Natalka — would have given her assent to the scheme.</p>

            <p>Their proud devotion to that young man became clear to me in a very short time.
                Following his directions they went straight to Switzerland — to Zurich — where they
                remained the best part of a year. From Zurich, which they did not like, they came to
                Geneva. A friend of mine in Lausanne, a lecturer in history at the University (he
                had married a Russian lady, a distant connection of Mrs. Haldin’s), wrote to me
                suggesting I should call on these ladies. It was a very kindly meant business
                suggestion. Miss Haldin wished to go through a course of reading the best English
                authors with a competent teacher.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin received me very kindly. Her bad French, of which she was smilingly
                conscious, did away with the formality of the first interview. She was a tall woman
                in a black silk dress. A wide brow, regular features, and delicately cut lips,
                testified to her past beauty. She sat upright in an easy chair and in a rather weak,
                gentle voice told me that her Natalka simply thirsted after knowledge. Her thin
                hands were lying on her lap, her facial immobility had in it something monachal. “In
                Russia,” she went on, “all knowledge was tainted with falsehood. Not chemistry and
                all that, but education generally,” she explained. The Government corrupted the
                teaching for its own purposes. Both her children felt that. Her Natalka had obtained
                a diploma of a Superior School for Women and her son was a student at the St.
                Petersburg University. He had a brilliant intellect, a most noble unselfish nature,
                and he was the oracle of his comrades. Early next year, she hoped he would join them
                and they would then go to Italy together. In any other country but their own she
                would have been certain of a great future for a man with the extraordinary abilities
                and the lofty character of her son — but in Russia . . . .</p>

            <p>The young lady sitting by the window turned her head and said —</p>

            <p>“Come, mother. Even with us things change with years.”</p>

            <p>Her voice was deep, almost harsh, and yet caressing in its harshness. She had a dark
                complexion, with red lips and a full figure. She gave the impression of strong
                vitality. The old lady sighed.</p>

            <p>“You are both young — you two. It is easy for you to hope. But I, too, am not
                hopeless. Indeed, how could I be with a son like this.”</p>

            <p>I addressed Miss Haldin, asking her what authors she wished to read. She directed
                upon me her grey eyes shaded by black eyelashes, and I became aware, notwithstanding
                my years, how attractive physically her personality could be to a man capable of
                appreciating in a woman something else than the mere grace of femininity. Her glance
                was as direct and trustful as that of a young man yet unspoiled by the world’s wise
                lessons. And it was intrepid, but in this intrepidity there was nothing aggressive.
                A naive yet thoughtful assurance is a better definition. She had reflected already
                (in Russia the young begin to think early), but she had never known deception as yet
                because obviously she had never yet fallen under the sway of passion. She was — to
                look at her was enough — very capable of being roused by an idea or simply by a
                person. At least, so I judged with I believe an unbiassed mind; for clearly my
                person could not be the person — and as to my ideas!. . .</p>

            <p>We became excellent friends in the course of our reading. It was very pleasant.
                Without fear of provoking a smile, I shall confess that I became very much attached
                to that young girl. At the end of four months I told her that now she could very
                well go on reading English by herself. It was time for the teacher to depart. My
                pupil looked unpleasantly surprised.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin, with her immobility of feature and kindly expression of the eyes,
                uttered from her armchair in her uncertain French, “<hi>Mais l’ami reviendra.</hi>“
                And so it was settled. I returned- -not four times a week as before, but pretty
                frequently. In the autumn we made some short excursions together in company with
                other Russians. My friendship with these ladies gave me a standing in the Russian
                colony which otherwise I could not have had.</p>

            <p>The day I saw in the papers the news of Mr. de P- —‘s assassination — it was a Sunday
                — I met the two ladies in the street and walked with them for some distance. Mrs.
                Haldin wore a heavy grey cloak, I remember, over her black silk dress, and her fine
                eyes met mine with a very quiet expression.</p>

            <p>“We have been to the late service,” she said. “Natalka came with me. Her
                girl-friends, the students here, of course don’t. . . . With us in Russia the church
                is so identified with oppression, that it seems almost necessary when one wishes to
                be free in this life, to give up all hope of a future existence. But I cannot give
                up praying for my son.”</p>

            <p>She added with a sort of stony grimness, colouring slightly, and in French, “<hi>Ce
                    n’est peut etre qu’une habitude.</hi>“ (“It may be only habit.”)</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin was carrying the prayer-book. She did not glance at her mother.</p>

            <p>“You and Victor are both profound believers,” she said.</p>

            <p>I communicated to them the news from their country which I had just read in a cafe.
                For a whole minute we walked together fairly briskly in silence. Then Mrs. Haldin
                murmured —</p>

            <p>“There will be more trouble, more persecutions for this. They may be even closing the
                University. There is neither peace nor rest in Russia for one but in the grave.</p>

            <p>“Yes. The way is hard,” came from the daughter, looking straight before her at the
                Chain of Jura covered with snow, like a white wall closing the end of the street.
                “But concord is not so very far off.”</p>

            <p>“That is what my children think,” observed Mrs. Haldin to me.</p>

            <p>I did not conceal my feeling that these were strange times to talk of concord.
                Nathalie Haldin surprised me by saying, as if she had thought very much on the
                subject, that the occidentals did not understand the situation. She was very calm
                and youthfully superior.</p>

            <p>“You think it is a class conflict, or a conflict of interests, as social contests are
                with you in Europe. But it is not that at all. It is something quite different.”</p>

            <p>“It is quite possible that I don’t understand,” I admitted.</p>

            <p>That propensity of lifting every problem from the plane of the understandable by
                means of some sort of mystic expression, is very Russian. I knew her well enough to
                have discovered her scorn for all the practical forms of political liberty known to
                the western world. I suppose one must be a Russian to understand Russian simplicity,
                a terrible corroding simplicity in which mystic phrases clothe a naive and hopeless
                cynicism. I think sometimes that the psychological secret of the profound difference
                of that people consists in this, that they detest life, the irremediable life of the
                earth as it is, whereas we westerners cherish it with perhaps an equal exaggeration
                of its sentimental value. But this is a digression indeed . . . .</p>

            <p>I helped these ladies into the tramcar and they asked me to call in the afternoon. At
                least Mrs. Haldin asked me as she climbed up, and her Natalka smiled down at the
                dense westerner indulgently from the rear platform of the moving car. The light of
                the clear wintry forenoon was softened in her grey eyes.</p>

            <p>Mr. Razumov’s record, like the open book of fate, revives for me the memory of that
                day as something startlingly pitiless in its freedom from all forebodings. Victor
                Haldin was still with the living, but with the living whose only contact with life
                is the expectation of death. He must have been already referring to the last of his
                earthly affections, the hours of that obstinate silence, which for him was to be
                prolonged into eternity. That afternoon the ladies entertained a good many of their
                compatriots — more than was usual for them to receive at one time; and the
                drawing-room on the ground floor of a large house on the Boulevard des Philosophes
                was very much crowded.</p>

            <p>I outstayed everybody; and when I rose Miss Haldin stood up too. I took her hand and
                was moved to revert to that morning’s conversation in the street.</p>

            <p>“Admitting that we occidentals do not understand the character of your . . . .” I
                began.</p>

            <p>It was as if she had been prepared for me by some mysterious fore-knowledge. She
                checked me gently —</p>

            <p>“Their impulses — their . . . “ she sought the proper expression and found it, but in
                French. . .” their <hi>mouvements d’ame.</hi>”</p>

            <p>Her voice was not much above a whisper.</p>

            <p>“Very well,” I said. “ But still we are looking at a conflict. You say it is not a
                conflict of classes and not a conflict of interests. Suppose I admitted that. Are
                antagonistic ideas then to be reconciled more easily — can they be cemented with
                blood and violence into that concord which you proclaim to be so near?”</p>

            <p>She looked at me searchingly with her clear grey eyes, without answering my
                reasonable question — my obvious, my unanswerable question.</p>

            <p>“It is inconceivable,” I added, with something like annoyance.</p>

            <p>“Everything is inconceivable,” she said. “The whole world is inconceivable to the
                strict logic of ideas. And yet the world exists to our senses, and we exist in it.
                There must be a necessity superior to our conceptions. It is a very miserable and a
                very false thing to belong to the majority. We Russians shall find some better form
                of national freedom than an artificial conflict of parties — which is wrong because
                it is a conflict and contemptible because it is artificial. It is left for us
                Russians to discover a better way.”</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin had been looking out of the window. She turned upon me the almost
                lifeless beauty of her face, and the living benign glance of her big dark eyes.</p>

            <p>“That’s what my children think,” she declared.</p>

            <p>“I suppose,” I addressed Miss Haldin, “that you will be shocked if I tell you that I
                haven’t understood — I won’t say a single word; I’ve understood all the words. . . .
                But what can be this era of disembodied concord you are looking forward to. Life is
                a thing of form. It has its plastic shape and a definite intellectual aspect. The
                most idealistic conceptions of love and forbearance must be clothed in flesh as it
                were before they can be made understandable.”</p>

            <p>I took my leave of Mrs. Haldin, whose beautiful lips never stirred. She smiled with
                her eyes only. Nathalie Haldin went with me as far as the door, very amiable.</p>

            <p>“Mother imagines that I am the slavish echo of my brother Victor. It is not so. He
                understands me better than I can understand him. When he joins us and you come to
                know him you will see what an exceptional soul it is.” She paused. “He is not a
                strong man in the conventional sense, you know,” she added. “But his character is
                without a flaw”</p>

            <p>“I believe that it will not be difficult for me to make friends with your brother
                Victor.”</p>

            <p>“Don’t expect to understand him quite,” she said, a little maliciously. “He is not at
                all — at all — western at bottom.”</p>

            <p>And on this unnecessary warning I left the room with another bow in the doorway to
                Mrs. Haldin in her armchair by the window. The shadow of autocracy all unperceived
                by me had already fallen upon the Boulevard des Philosophes, in the free,
                independent and democratic city of Geneva, where there is a quarter called “La
                Petite Russie.” Whenever two Russians come together, the shadow of autocracy is with
                them, tinging their thoughts, their views, their most intimate feelings, their
                private life, their public utterances — haunting the secret of their silences.</p>

            <p>What struck me next in the course of a week or so was the silence of these ladies. I
                used to meet them walking in the public garden near the University. They greeted me
                with their usual friendliness, but I could not help noticing their taciturnity. By
                that time it was generally known that the assassin of M. de P—— had been caught,
                judged, and executed. So much had been declared officially to the news agencies. But
                for the world at large he remained anonymous. The official secrecy had withheld his
                name from the public. I really cannot imagine for what reason.</p>

            <p>One day I saw Miss Haldin walking alone in the main valley of the Bastions under the
                naked trees.</p>

            <p>“Mother is not very well,” she explained.</p>

            <p>As Mrs.Haldin had, it seemed, never had a day’s illness in her life, this
                indisposition was disquieting. It was nothing definite, too.</p>

            <p>“I think she is fretting because we have not heard from my brother for rather a long
                time.”</p>

            <p>“No news — good news,” I said cheerfully, and we began to walk slowly side by
                side.</p>

            <p>“Not in Russia,” she breathed out so low that I only just caught the words. I looked
                at her with more attention.</p>

            <p>“You too are anxious? ”</p>

            <p>She admitted after a moment of hesitation that she was.</p>

            <p>“It is really such a long time since we heard . . . .”</p>

            <p>And before I could offer the usual banal suggestions she confided in me.</p>

            <p>“Oh! But it is much worse than that. I wrote to a family we know in Petersburg. They
                had not seen him for more than a month. They thought he was already with us. They
                were even offended a little that he should have left Petersburg without calling on
                them. The husband of the lady went at once to his lodgings. Victor had left there
                and they did not know his address.”</p>

            <p>I remember her catching her breath rather pitifully. Her brother had not been seen at
                lectures for a very long time either. He only turned up now and then at the
                University gate to ask the porter for his letters. And the gentleman friend was told
                that the student Haldin did not come to claim the last two letters for him. But the
                police came to inquire if the student Haldin ever received any correspondence at the
                University and took them away.</p>

            <p>“My two last letters,” she said.</p>

            <p>We faced each other. A few snow-flakes fluttered under the naked boughs. The sky was
                dark.</p>

            <p>“What do you think could have happened?” I asked.</p>

            <p>Her shoulders moved slightly.</p>

            <p>“One can never tell — in Russia.”</p>

            <p>I saw then the shadow of autocracy lying upon Russian lives in their submission or
                their revolt. I saw it touch her handsome open face nestled in a fur collar and
                darken her clear eyes that shone upon me brilliantly grey in the murky light of a
                beclouded, inclement afternoon.</p>

            <p>“Let us move on,” she said.” It is cold standing — to-day.”</p>

            <p>She shuddered a little and stamped her little feet. We moved briskly to the end of
                the alley and back to the great gates of the garden.</p>

            <p>“Have you told your mother? “ I ventured to ask.</p>

            <p>“No. Not yet. I came out to walk off the impression of this letter.”</p>

            <p>I heard a rustle of paper somewhere. It came from her muff. She had the letter with
                her in there.</p>

            <p>“What is it that you are afraid of?” I asked.</p>

            <p>To us Europeans of the West, all ideas of political plots and conspiracies seem
                childish, crude inventions for the theatre or a novel. I did not like to be more
                definite in my inquiry.</p>

            <p>“For us — for my mother specially, what I am afraid of is incertitude. People do
                disappear. Yes, they do disappear. I leave you to imagine what it is — the cruelty
                of the dumb weeks — months — years! This friend of ours has abandoned his inquiries
                when he heard of the police getting hold of the letters. I suppose he was afraid of
                compromising himself. He has a wife and children — and why should he, after all.
                . . . Moreover, he is without influential connections and not rich. What could he
                do? . . . Yes, I am afraid of silence — for my poor mother. She won’t be able to
                bear it. For my brother I am afraid of. . .” she became almost indistinct, “of
                anything.”</p>

            <p>We were now near the gate opposite the theatre. She raised her voice.</p>

            <p>“But lost people do turn up even in Russia. Do you know what my last hope is? Perhaps
                the next thing we know, we shall see him walking into our rooms.”</p>

            <p>I raised my hat and she passed out of the gardens, graceful and strong, after a
                slight movement of the head to me, her hands in the muff, crumpling the cruel
                Petersburg letter.</p>

            <p>On returning home I opened the newspaper I receive from London, and glancing down the
                correspondence from Russia — not the telegrams but the correspondence — the first
                thing that caught my eye was the name of Haldin. Mr. de P— -‘s death was no longer
                an actuality, but the enterprising correspondent was proud of having ferreted out
                some unofficial information about that fact of modern history. He had got hold of
                Haldin’s name, and had picked up the story of the midnight arrest in the street. But
                the sensation from a journalistic point of view was already well in the past. He did
                not allot to it more than twenty lines out of a full column. It was quite enough to
                give me a sleepless night. I perceived that it would have been a sort of treason to
                let Miss Haldin come without preparation upon that journalistic discovery which
                would infallibly be reproduced on the morrow by French and Swiss newspapers. I had a
                very bad time of it till the morning, wakeful with nervous worry and night-marish
                with the feeling of being mixed up with something theatrical and morbidly affected.
                The incongruity of such a complication in those two women’s lives was sensible to me
                all night in the form of absolute anguish. It seemed due to their refined simplicity
                that it should remain concealed from them for ever. Arriving at an unconscionably
                early hour at the door of their apartment, I felt as if I were about to commit an
                act of vandalism . . . .</p>

            <p>The middle-aged servant woman led me into the drawing-room where there was a duster
                on a chair and a broom leaning against the centre table. The motes danced in the
                sunshine; I regretted I had not written a letter instead of coming myself, and was
                thankful for the brightness of the day. Miss Haldin in a plain black dress came
                lightly out of her mother’s room with a fixed uncertain smile on her lips.</p>

            <p>I pulled the paper out of my pocket. I did not imagine that a number of the
                    <hi>Standard</hi> could have the effect of Medusa’s head. Her face went stony in
                a moment — her eyes — her limbs. The most terrible thing was that being stony she
                remained alive. One was conscious of her palpitating heart. I hope she forgave me
                the delay of my clumsy circumlocution. It was not very prolonged; she could not have
                kept so still from head to foot for more than a second or two; and then I heard her
                draw a breath. As if the shock had paralysed her moral resistance, and affected the
                firmness of her muscles, the contours of her face seemed to have given way. She was
                frightfully altered. She looked aged — ruined. But only for a moment. She said with
                decision —</p>

            <p>“I am going to tell my mother at once.”</p>

            <p>“Would that be safe in her state?” I objected.</p>

            <p>“What can be worse than the state she has been in for the last month? We understand
                this in another way. The crime is not at his door. Don’t imagine I am defending him
                before you.”</p>

            <p>She went to the bedroom door, then came back to ask me in a low murmur not to go till
                she returned. For twenty interminable minutes not a sound reached me. At last Miss
                Haldin came out and walked across the room with her quick light step. When she
                reached the armchair she dropped into it heavily as if completely exhausted.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin, she told me, had not shed a tear. She was sitting up in bed, and her
                immobility, her silence, were very alarming. At last she lay down gently and had
                motioned her daughter away.</p>

            <p>“She will call me in presently,” added Miss Haldin. “I left a bell near the bed.”</p>

            <p>I confess that my very real sympathy had no standpoint. The Western readers for whom
                this story is written will understand what I mean. It was, if I may say so, the want
                of experience. Death is a remorseless spoliator. The anguish of irreparable loss is
                familiar to us all. There is no life so lonely as to be safe against that
                experience. But the grief I had brought to these two ladies had gruesome
                associations. It had the associations of bombs and gallows — a lurid, Russian
                colouring which made the complexion of my sympathy uncertain.</p>

            <p>I was grateful to Miss Haldin for not embarrassing me by an outward display of deep
                feeling. I admired her for that wonderful command over herself, even while I was a
                little frightened at it. It was the stillness of a great tension. What if it should
                suddenly snap? Even the door of Mrs. Haldin’s room, with the old mother alone in
                there, had a rather awful aspect.</p>

            <p>Nathalie Haldin murmured sadly —</p>

            <p>“I suppose you are wondering what my feelings are?”</p>

            <p>Essentially that was true. It was that very wonder which unsettled my sympathy of a
                dense Occidental. I could get hold of nothing but of some commonplace phrases, those
                futile phrases that give the measure of our impotence before each other’s trials I
                mumbled something to the effect that, for the young, life held its hopes and
                compensations. It held duties too — but of that I was certain it was not necessary
                to remind her.</p>

            <p>She had a handkerchief in her hands and pulled at it nervously.</p>

            <p>“I am not likely to forget my mother,” she said. “We used to be three. Now we are two
                — two women. She’s not so very old. She may live quite a long time yet. What have we
                to look for in the future? For what hope and what consolation?”</p>

            <p>“You must take a wider view,” I said resolutely, thinking that with this exceptional
                creature this was the right note to strike. She looked at me steadily for a moment,
                and then the tears she had been keeping down flowed unrestrained. She jumped up and
                stood in the window with her back to me.</p>

            <p>I slipped away without attempting even to approach her. Next day I was told at the
                door that Mrs. Haldin was better. The middle-aged servant remarked that a lot of
                people — Russians — had called that day, but Miss Haldin bad not seen anybody. A
                fortnight later, when making my daily call, I was asked in and found Mrs. Haldin
                sitting in her usual place by the window.</p>

            <p>At first one would have thought that nothing was changed. I saw across the room the
                familiar profile, a little sharper in outline and overspread by a uniform pallor as
                might have been expected in an invalid. But no disease could have accounted for the
                change in her black eyes, smiling no longer with gentle irony. She raised them as
                she gave me her hand. I observed the three weeks’ old number of the
                    <hi>Standard</hi> folded with the correspondence from Russia uppermost, lying on
                a little table by the side of the armchair. Mrs. Haldin’s voice was startlingly weak
                and colourless. Her first words to me framed a question.</p>

            <p>“Has there been anything more in papers?”</p>

            <p>I released her long emaciated hand, shook my head negatively, and sat down.</p>

            <p>“The English press is wonderful. Nothing can be kept secret from it, and all the
                world must hear. Only our Russian news is not always easy to understand. Not always
                easy. . . . But English mothers do not look for news like that . . . .”</p>

            <p>She laid her hand on the newspaper and took it away again. I said —</p>

            <p>“We too have had tragic times in our history.”</p>

            <p>“A long time ago. A very long time ago.”</p>

            <p>“Yes.”</p>

            <p>“There are nations that have made their bargain with fate,” said Miss Haldin, who had
                approached us. “We need not envy them.”</p>

            <p>“Why this scorn?” I asked gently. “It may be that our bargain was not a very lofty
                one. But the terms men and nations obtain from Fate are hallowed by the price.”</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin turned her head away and looked out of the window for a time, with that
                new, sombre, extinct gaze of her sunken eyes which so completely made another woman
                of her.</p>

            <p>“That Englishman, this correspondent,” she addressed me suddenly, “do you think it is
                possible that he knew my son?”</p>

            <p>To this strange question I could only say that it was possible of course. She saw my
                surprise.</p>

            <p>“If one knew what sort of man he was one could perhaps write to him,” she
                murmured.</p>

            <p>“Mother thinks,” explained Miss Haldin, standing between us, with one hand resting on
                the back of my chair, “that my poor brother perhaps did not try to save
                himself.”</p>

            <p>I looked up at Miss Haldin in sympathetic consternation, but Miss Haldin was looking
                down calmly at her mother. The latter said —</p>

            <p>“We do not know the address of any of his friends. Indeed, we know nothing of his
                Petersburg comrades. He had a multitude of young friends, only he never spoke much
                of them. One could guess that they were his disciples and that they idolized him.
                But he was so modest. One would think that with so many devoted . . . .”</p>

            <p>She averted her head again and looked down the Boulevard des Philosophes, a
                singularly arid and dusty thoroughfare, where nothing could be seen at the moment
                but two dogs, a little girl in a pinafore hopping on one leg, and in the distance a
                workman wheeling a bicycle.</p>

            <p>“Even amongst the Apostles of Christ there was found a Judas,” she whispered as if to
                herself, but with the evident intention to be heard by me.</p>

            <p>The Russian visitors assembled in little knots, conversed amongst themselves
                meantime, in low murmurs, and with brief glances in our direction. It was a great
                contrast to the usual loud volubility of these gatherings. Miss Haldin followed me
                into the ante-room.</p>

            <p>“People will come,” she said. “We cannot shut the door in their faces.”</p>

            <p>While I was putting on my overcoat she began to talk to me of her mother. Poor Mrs.
                Haldin was fretting after more news. She wanted to go on hearing about her
                unfortunate son. She could not make up her mind to abandon him quietly to the dumb
                unknown. She would persist in pursuing him in there through the long days of
                motionless silence face to face with the empty Boulevard des Philosophes. She could
                not understand why he had not escaped — as so many other revolutionists and
                conspirators had managed to escape in other instances of that kind. It was really
                inconceivable that the means of secret revolutionary organisations should have
                failed so inexcusably to preserve her son. But in reality the inconceivable that
                staggered her mind was nothing but the cruel audacity of Death passing over her head
                to strike at that young and precious heart.</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin mechanically, with an absorbed look, handed me my hat. I understood from
                her that the poor woman was possessed by the sombre and simple idea that her son
                must have perished because he did not want to be saved. It could not have been that
                he despaired of his country’s future. That was impossible. Was it possible that his
                mother and sister had not known how to merit his confidence; and that, after having
                done what he was compelled to do, his spirit became crushed by an intolerable doubt,
                his mind distracted by a sudden mistrust.</p>

            <p>I was very much shocked by this piece of ingenuity.</p>

            <p>“Our three lives were like that!” Miss Haldin twined the fingers of both her hands
                together in demonstration, then separated them slowly, looking straight into my
                face. “That’s what poor mother found to torment herself and me with, for all the
                years to come,” added the strange girl. At that moment her indefinable charm was
                revealed to me in the conjunction of passion and stoicism. I imagined what her life
                was likely to be by the side of Mrs. Haldin’s terrible immobility, inhabited by that
                fixed idea. But my concern was reduced to silence by my ignorance of her modes of
                feeling. Difference of nationality is a terrible obstacle for our complex Western
                natures. But Miss Haldin probably was too simple to suspect my embarrassment. She
                did not wait for me to say anything, but as if reading my thoughts on my face she
                went on courageously —</p>

            <p>“At first poor mother went numb, as our peasants say; then she began to think and she
                will go on now thinking and thinking in that unfortunate strain. You see yourself
                how cruel that is . . . .”</p>

            <p>I never spoke with greater sincerity than when I agreed with her that it would be
                deplorable in the highest degree. She took an anxious breath.</p>

            <p>“But all these strange details in the English paper,” she exclaimed suddenly. “What
                is the meaning of them? I suppose they are true? But is it not terrible that my poor
                brother should be caught wandering alone, as if in despair, about the streets at
                night . . . .”</p>

            <p>We stood so close to each other in the dark anteroom that I could see her biting her
                lower lip to suppress a dry sob. After a short pause she said —</p>

            <p>“I suggested to mother that he may have been betrayed by some false friend or simply
                by some cowardly creature. It may be easier for her to believe that.”</p>

            <p>I understood now the poor woman’s whispered allusion to Judas.</p>

            <p>“It may be easier,” I admitted, admiring inwardly the directness and the subtlety of
                the girl’s outlook. She was dealing with life as it was made for her by the
                political conditions of her country. She faced cruel realities, not morbid
                imaginings of her own making. I could not defend myself from a certain feeling of
                respect when she added simply —</p>

            <p>“Time they say can soften every sort of bitterness. But I cannot believe that it has
                any power over remorse. It is better that mother should think some person guilty of
                Victor’s death, than that she should connect it with a weakness of her son or a
                shortcoming of her own.”</p>

            <p>“But you, yourself, don’t suppose that . . . .” I began.</p>

            <p>She compressed her lips and shook her head. She harboured no evil thoughts against
                any one, she declared — and perhaps nothing that happened was unnecessary. On these
                words, pronounced low and sounding mysterious in the half obscurity of the
                ante-room, we parted with an expressive and warm handshake. The grip of her strong,
                shapely hand had a seductive frankness, a sort of exquisite virility. I do not know
                why she should have felt so friendly to me. It may be that she thought I understood
                her much better than I was able to do. The most precise of her sayings seemed always
                to me to have enigmatical prolongations vanishing somewhere beyond my reach. I am
                reduced to suppose that she appreciated my attention and my silence. The attention
                she could see was quite sincere, so that the silence could not be suspected of
                coldness. It seemed to satisfy her. And it is to be noted that if she confided in me
                it was clearly not with the expectation of receiving advice, for which, indeed she
                never asked.</p>

            <head>2</head>


            <p>Our daily relations were interrupted at this period for something like a fortnight. I
                had to absent myself unexpectedly from Geneva. On my return I lost no time in
                directing my steps up the Boulevard des Philosophes.</p>

            <p>Through the open door of the drawing-room I was annoyed to hear a visitor holding
                forth steadily in an unctuous deep voice.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin’s armchair by the window stood empty. On the sofa, Nathalie Haldin raised
                her charming grey eyes in a glance of greeting accompanied by the merest hint of a
                welcoming smile. But she made no movement. With her strong white hands lying
                inverted in the lap of her mourning dress she faced a man who presented to me a
                robust back covered with black broadcloth, and well in keeping with the deep voice.
                He turned his head sharply over his shoulder, but only for a moment.</p>

            <p>“Ah! your English friend. I know. I know. That’s nothing.”</p>

            <p>He wore spectacles with smoked glasses, a tall silk hat stood on the floor by the
                side of his chair. Flourishing slightly a big soft hand he went on with his
                discourse, precipitating his delivery a little more.</p>

            <p>“I have never changed the faith I held while wandering in the forests and bogs of
                Siberia. It sustained me then — it sustains me now. The great Powers of Europe are
                bound to disappear — and the cause of their collapse will be very simple. They will
                exhaust themselves struggling against their proletariat. In Russia it is different.
                In Russia we have no classes to combat each other, one holding the power of wealth,
                and the other mighty with the strength of numbers. We have only an unclean
                bureaucracy in the face of a people as great and as incorruptible as the ocean. No,
                we have no classes. But we have the Russian woman. The admirable Russian woman! I
                receive most remarkable letters signed by women. So elevated in tone, so courageous,
                breathing such a noble ardour of service! The greatest part of our hopes rests on
                women. I behold their thirst for knowledge. It is admirable. Look how they absorb,
                how they are making it their own. It is miraculous. But what is knowledge? . . . I
                understand that you have not been studying anything especially — medicine for
                instance. No? That’s right. Had I been honoured by being asked to advise you on the
                use of your time when you arrived here I would have been strongly opposed to such a
                course. Knowledge in itself is mere dross.”</p>

            <p>He had one of those bearded Russian faces without shape, a mere appearance of flesh
                and hair with not a single feature having any sort of character. His eyes being
                hidden by the dark glasses there was an utter absence of all expression. I knew him
                by sight. He was a Russian refugee of mark. All Geneva knew his burly black-coated
                figure. At one time all Europe was aware of the story of his life written by himself
                and translated into seven or more languages. In his youth he had led an idle,
                dissolute life. Then a society girl he was about to marry died suddenly and
                thereupon he abandoned the world of fashion, and began to conspire in a spirit of
                repentance, and, after that, his native autocracy took good care that the usual
                things should happen to him. He was imprisoned in fortresses, beaten within an inch
                of his life, and condemned to work in mines, with common criminals. The great
                success of his book, however, was the chain.</p>

            <p>I do not remember now the details of the weight and length of the fetters riveted on
                his limbs by an “Administrative” order, but it was in the number of pounds and the
                thickness of links an appalling assertion of the divine right of autocracy.
                Appalling and futile too, because this big man managed to carry off that simple
                engine of government with him into the woods. The sensational clink of these fetters
                is heard all through the chapters describing his escape — a subject of wonder to two
                continents. He had begun by concealing himself successfully from his guard in a hole
                on a river bank. It was the end of the day; with infinite labour he managed to free
                one of his legs. Meantime night fell. He was going to begin on his other leg when he
                was overtaken by a terrible misfortune. He dropped his file.</p>

            <p>All this is precise yet symbolic; and the file had its pathetic history. It was given
                to him unexpectedly one evening, by a quiet, pale-faced girl. The poor creature had
                come out to the mines to join one of his fellow convicts, a delicate young man, a
                mechanic and a social democrat, with broad cheekbones and large staring eyes. She
                had worked her way across half Russia and nearly the whole of Siberia to be near
                him, and, as it seems, with the hope of helping him to escape. But she arrived too
                late. Her lover had died only a week before.</p>

            <p>Through that obscure episode, as he says, in the history of ideas in Russia, the file
                came into his hands, and inspired him with an ardent resolution to regain his
                liberty. When it slipped through his fingers it was as if it had gone straight into
                the earth. He could by no manner of means put his hand on it again in the dark. He
                groped systematically in the loose earth, in the mud, in the water; the night was
                passing meantime, the precious night on which he counted to get away into the
                forests, his only chance of escape. For a moment he was tempted by despair to give
                up; but recalling the quiet, sad face of the heroic girl, he felt profoundly ashamed
                of his weakness. She had selected him for the gift of liberty and he must show
                himself worthy of the favour conferred by her feminine, indomitable soul. It
                appeared to be a sacred trust. To fail would have been a sort of treason against the
                sacredness of self-sacrifice and womanly love.</p>

            <p>There are in his book whole pages of self- analysis whence emerges like a white
                figure from a dark confused sea the conviction of woman’s spiritual superiority —
                his new faith confessed since in several volumes. His first tribute to it, the great
                act of his conversion, was his extraordinary existence in the endless forests of the
                Okhotsk Province, with the loose end of the chain wound about his waist. A strip
                torn off his convict shirt secured the end firmly. Other strips fastened it at
                intervals up his left leg to deaden the clanking and to prevent the slack links from
                getting hooked in the bushes. He became very fierce. He developed an unsuspected
                genius for the arts of a wild and hunted existence. He learned to creep into
                villages without betraying his presence by anything more than an occasional faint
                jingle. He broke into outhouses with an axe he managed to purloin in a wood-cutters’
                camp. In the deserted tracts of country he lived on wild berries and hunted for
                honey. His clothing dropped off him gradually. His naked tawny figure glimpsed
                vaguely through the bushes with a cloud of mosquitoes and flies hovering about the
                shaggy head, spread tales of terror through whole districts. His temper grew savage
                as the days went by, and he was glad to discover that that there was so much of a
                brute in him. He had nothing else to put his trust in. For it was as though there
                had been two human beings indissolubly joined in that enterprise. The civilized man,
                the enthusiast of advanced humanitarian ideals thirsting for the triumph of
                spiritual love and political liberty; and the stealthy, primeval savage, pitilessly
                cunning in the preservation of his freedom from day to day, like a tracked wild
                beast.</p>

            <p>The wild beast was making its way instinctively eastward to the Pacific coast, and
                the civilised humanitarian in fearful anxious dependence watched the proceedings
                with awe. Through all these weeks he could never make up his mind to appeal to human
                compassion. In the wary primeval savage this shyness might have been natural, but
                the other too, the civilized creature, the thinker, the escaping “political” had
                developed an absurd form of morbid pessimism, a form of temporary insanity,
                originating perhaps in the physical worry and discomfort of the chain. These links,
                he fancied, made him odious to the rest of mankind. It was a repugnant and
                suggestive load. Nobody could feel any pity at the disgusting sight of a man
                escaping with a broken chain. His imagination became affected by his fetters in a
                precise, matter-of-fact manner. It seemed to him impossible that people could resist
                the temptation of fastening the loose end to a staple in the wall while they went
                for the nearest police official. Crouching in holes or hidden in thickets, he had
                tried to read the faces of unsuspecting free settlers working in the clearings or
                passing along the paths within a foot or two of his eyes. His feeling was that no
                man on earth could be trusted with the temptation of the chain.</p>

            <p>One day, however, he chanced to come upon a solitary woman. It was on an open slope
                of rough grass outside the forest. She sat on the bank of a narrow stream; she had a
                red handkerchief on her head and a small basket was lying on the ground near her
                hand. At a little distance could be seen a cluster of log cabins, with a water-mill
                over a dammed pool shaded by birch trees and looking bright as glass in the
                twilight. He approached her silently, his hatchet stuck in his iron belt, a thick
                cudgel in his hand; there were leaves and bits of twig in his tangled hair, in his
                matted beard; bunches of rags he had wound round the links fluttered from his waist.
                A faint clink of his fetters made the woman turn her head. Too terrified by this
                savage apparition to jump up or even to scream, she was yet too stout-hearted to
                faint. . . . Expecting nothing less than to be murdered on the spot she covered her
                eyes with her hands to avoid the sight of the descending axe. When at last she found
                courage to look again, she saw the shaggy wild man sitting on the bank six feet away
                from her. His thin, sinewy arms hugged his naked legs; the long beard covered the
                knees on which he rested his chin; all these clasped, folded limbs, the bare
                shoulders, the wild head with red staring eyes, shook and trembled violently while
                the bestial creature was making efforts to speak. It was six weeks since he had
                heard the sound of his own voice. It seemed as though he had lost the faculty of
                speech. He had become a dumb and despairing brute, till the woman’s sudden,
                unexpected cry of profound pity, the insight of her feminine compassion discovering
                the complex misery of the man under the terrifying aspect of the monster, restored
                him to the ranks of humanity. This point of view is presented in his book, with a
                very effective eloquence. She ended, he says, by shedding tears over him, sacred,
                redeeming tears, while he also wept with joy in the manner of a converted sinner.
                Directing him to hide in the bushes and wait patiently (a police patrol was expected
                in the Settlement) she went away towards the houses, promising to return at
                night.</p>

            <p>As if providentially appointed to be the newly wedded wife of the village blacksmith,
                the woman persuaded her husband to come out with her, bringing some tools of his
                trade, a hammer, a chisel, a small anvil. . . . “My fetters”— the book says —” were
                struck off on the banks of the stream, in the starlight of a calm night by an
                athletic, taciturn young man of the people, kneeling at my feet, while the woman
                like a liberating genius stood by with clasped hands.” Obviously a symbolic couple.
                At the same time they furnished his regained humanity with some decent clothing, and
                put heart into the new man by the information that the seacoast of the Pacific was
                only a very few miles away. It could be seen, in fact, from the top of the next
                ridge . . . .</p>

            <p>The rest of his escape does not lend itself to mystic treatment and symbolic
                interpretation. He ended by finding his way to the West by the Suez Canal route in
                the usual manner. Reaching the shores of South Europe he sat down to write his
                autobiography — the great literary success of its year. This book was followed by
                other books written with the declared purpose of elevating humanity. In these works
                he preached generally the cult of the woman. For his own part he practised it under
                the rites of special devotion to the transcendental merits of a certain Madame de S—
                — a lady of advanced views, no longer very young, once upon a time the intriguing
                wife of a now dead and forgotten diplomat. Her loud pretensions to be one of the
                leaders of modern thought and of modern sentiment, she sheltered (like Voltaire and
                Mme. de Stael) on the republican territory of Geneva. Driving through the streets in
                her big landau she exhibited to the indifference of the natives and the stares of
                the tourists a long-waisted, youthful figure of hieratic stiffness, with a pair of
                big gleaming eyes, rolling restlessly behind a short veil of black lace, which,
                coming down no further than her vividly red lips, resembled a mask. Usually the
                “heroic fugitive” (this name was bestowed upon him in a review of the English
                edition of his book)— the “ heroic fugitive ” accompanied her, sitting, portentously
                bearded and darkly bespectacled, not by her side, but opposite her, with his back to
                the horses. Thus, facing each other, with no one else in the roomy carriage, their
                airings suggested a conscious public manifestation. Or it may have been unconscious.
                Russian simplicity often marches innocently on the edge of cynicism for some lofty
                purpose. But it is a vain enterprise for sophisticated Europe to try and understand
                these doings. Considering the air of gravity extending even to the physiognomy of
                the coachman and the action of the showy horses, this quaint display might have
                possessed a mystic significance, but to the corrupt frivolity of a Western mind,
                like my own, it seemed hardly decent.</p>

            <p>However, it is not becoming for an obscure teacher of languages to criticize a
                “heroic fugitive” of worldwide celebrity. I was aware from hearsay that he was an
                industrious busy- body, hunting up his compatriots in hotels, in private lodgings,
                and — I was told — conferring upon them the honour of his notice in public gardens
                when a suitable opening presented itself. I was under the impression that after a
                visit or two, several months before, he had given up the ladies Haldin — no doubt
                reluctantly, for there could be no question of his being a determined person. It was
                perhaps to be expected that he should reappear again on this terrible occasion, as a
                Russian and a revolutionist, to say the right thing, to strike the true, perhaps a
                comforting, note. But I did not like to see him sitting there. I trust that an
                unbecoming jealousy of my privileged position had nothing to do with it. I made no
                claim to a special standing for my silent friendship. Removed by the difference of
                age and nationality as if into the sphere of another existence, I produced, even
                upon myself, the effect of a dumb helpless ghost, of an anxious immaterial thing
                that could only hover about without the power to protect or guide by as much as a
                whisper. Since Miss Haldin with her sure instinct had refrained from introducing me
                to the burly celebrity, I would have retired quietly and returned later on, had I
                not met a peculiar expression in her eyes which I interpreted as a request to stay,
                with the view, perhaps, of shortening an unwelcome visit.</p>

            <p>He picked up his hat, but only to deposit it on his knees.</p>

            <p>“We shall meet again, Natalia Victorovna. To- day I have called only to mark those
                feelings towards your honoured mother and yourself, the nature of which you cannot
                doubt. I needed no urging, but Eleanor — Madame de S—— herself has in a way sent me.
                She extends to you the hand of feminine fellowship. There is positively in all the
                range of human sentiments no joy and no sorrow that woman cannot understand,
                elevate, and spiritualize by her interpretation. That young man newly arrived from
                St. Petersburg, I have mentioned to you, is already under the charm.”</p>

            <p>At this point Miss Haldin got up abruptly. I was glad. He did not evidently expect
                anything so decisive and, at first, throwing his head back, he tilted up his dark
                glasses with bland curiosity. At last, recollecting himself, he stood up hastily,
                seizing his hat off his knees with great adroitness.</p>

            <p>“How is it, Natalia Victorovna, that you have kept aloof so long, from what after all
                is — let disparaging tongues say what they like — a unique centre of intellectual
                freedom and of effort to shape a high conception of our future? In the case of your
                honoured mother I understand in a measure. At her age new ideas — new faces are not
                perhaps. . . . But you! Was it mistrust — or indifference? You must come out of your
                reserve. We Russians have no right to be reserved with each other. In our
                circumstances it is almost a crime against humanity. The luxury of private grief is
                not for us. Nowadays the devil is not combated by prayers and fasting. And what is
                fasting after all but starvation. You must not starve yourself, Natalia Victorovna.
                Strength is what we want. Spiritual strength, I mean. As to the other kind, what
                could withstand us Russians if we only put it forth? Sin is different in our day,
                and the way of salvation for pure souls is different too. It is no longer to be
                found in monasteries but in the world, in the . . . .”</p>

            <p>The deep sound seemed to rise from under the floor, and one felt steeped in it to the
                lips. Miss Haldin’s interruption resembled the effort of a drowning person to keep
                above water. She struck in with an accent of impatience —</p>

            <p>“But, Peter Ivanovitch, I don’t mean to retire into a monastery. Who would look for
                salvation there?”</p>

            <p>“I spoke figuratively,” he boomed.</p>

            <p>“Well, then, I am speaking figuratively too. But sorrow is sorrow and pain is pain in
                the old way. They make their demands upon people. One has got to face them the best
                way one can. I know that the blow which has fallen upon us so unexpectedly is only
                an episode in the fate of a people. You may rest assured that I don’t forget that.
                But just now I have to think of my mother. How can you expect me to leave her to
                herself . . .?”</p>

            <p>“That is putting it in a very crude way,” he protested in his great effortless
                voice.</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin did not wait for the vibration to die out.</p>

            <p>“And run about visiting amongst a lot of strange people. The idea is distasteful for
                me; and I do not know what else you may mean?”</p>

            <p>He towered before her, enormous, deferential, cropped as close as a convict and this
                big pinkish poll evoked for me the vision of a wild head with matted locks peering
                through parted bushes, glimpses of naked, tawny limbs slinking behind the masses of
                sodden foliage under a cloud of flies and mosquitoes. It was an involuntary tribute
                to the vigour of his writing. Nobody could doubt that he had wandered in Siberian
                forests, naked and girt with a chain. The black broadcloth coat invested his person
                with a character of austere decency — something recalling a missionary.</p>

            <p>“Do you know what I want, Natalia Victorovna?” he uttered solemnly. “I want you to be
                a fanatic.”</p>

            <p>“A fanatic?”</p>

            <p>“Yes. Faith alone won’t do.”</p>

            <p>His voice dropped to a still lower tone. He raised for a moment one thick arm; the
                other remained hanging down against his thigh, with the fragile silk hat at the
                end.</p>

            <p>“I shall tell you now something which I entreat you to ponder over carefully. Listen,
                we need a force that would move heaven and earth — nothing less.”</p>

            <p>The profound, subterranean note of this “nothing less” made one shudder, almost, like
                the deep muttering of wind in the pipes of an organ.</p>

            <p>“And are we to find that force in the salon of Madame de S——? Excuse me, Peter
                Ivanovitch, if I permit myself to doubt it. Is not that lady a woman of the great
                world, an aristocrat?”</p>

            <p>“Prejudice!” he cried. “You astonish me. And suppose she was all that! She is also a
                woman of flesh and blood. There is always something to weigh down the spiritual side
                in all of us. But to make of it a reproach is what I did not expect from you. No! I
                did not expect that. One would think you have listened to some malevolent
                scandal.”</p>

            <p>“I have heard no gossip, I assure you. In our province how could we? But the world
                speaks of her. What can there be in common in a lady of that sort and an obscure
                country girl like me?”</p>

            <p>“She is a perpetual manifestation of a noble and peerless spirit,” he broke in. “Her
                charm — no, I shall not speak of her charm. But, of course, everybody who approaches
                her falls under the spell. . . . Contradictions vanish, trouble falls away from one.
                . . . Unless I am mistaken- -but I never make a mistake in spiritual matters- -you
                are troubled in your soul, Natalia Victorovna.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin’s clear eyes looked straight at his soft enormous face; I received the
                impression that behind these dark spectacles of his he could be as impudent as he
                chose.</p>

            <p>“Only the other evening walking back to town from Chateau Borel with our latest
                interesting arrival from Petersburg, I could notice the powerful soothing influence
                — I may say reconciling influence. . . . There he was, all these kilometres along
                the shores of the lake, silent, like a man who has been shown the way of peace. I
                could feel the leaven working in his soul, you understand. For one thing he listened
                to me patiently. I myself was inspired that evening by the firm and exquisite genius
                of Eleanor — Madame de S— — you know. It was a full moon and I could observe his
                face. I cannot be deceived . . . .”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin, looking down, seemed to hesitate.</p>

            <p>“Well! I will think of what you said, Peter Ivanovitch. I shall try to call as soon
                as I can leave mother for an hour or two safely.”</p>

            <p>Coldly as these words were said I was amazed at the concession. He snatched her right
                hand with such fervour that I thought he was going to press it to his lips or his
                breast. But he only held it by the finger-tips in his great paw and shook it a
                little up and down while he delivered his last volley of words.</p>

            <p>“That’s right. That’s right. I haven’t obtained your full confidence as yet, Natalia
                Victorovna, but that will come. All in good time. The sister of Viktor Haldin cannot
                be without importance. . . . It’s simply impossible. And no woman can remain sitting
                on the steps. Flowers, tears, applause — that has had its time; it’s a mediaeval
                conception. The arena, the arena itself is the place for women!”</p>

            <p>He relinquished her hand with a flourish, as if giving it to her for a gift, and
                remained still, his head bowed in dignified submission before her femininity.</p>

            <p>“The arena! . . . You must descend into the arena, Natalia.”</p>

            <p>He made one step backwards, inclined his enormous body, and was gone swiftly. The
                door fell to behind him. But immediately the powerful resonance of his voice was
                heard addressing in the ante-room the middle-aged servant woman who was letting him
                out. Whether he exhorted her too to descend into the arena I cannot tell. The thing
                sounded like a lecture, and the slight crash of the outer door cut it short
                suddenly.</p>

            <p>We remained looking at each other for a time.”</p>

            <p>“Do you know who he is?”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin, coming forward, put this question to me in English.</p>

            <p>I took her offered hand.</p>

            <p>“Everybody knows. He is a revolutionary feminist, a great writer, if you like, and —
                how shall I say it — the — the familiar guest of Madame de S——‘s mystic
                revolutionary salon.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin passed her hand over her forehead.</p>

            <p>“You know, he was with me for more than an hour before you came in. I was so glad
                mother was lying down. She has many nights without sleep, and then sometimes in the
                middle of the day she gets a rest of several hours. It is sheer exhaustion — but
                still, I am thankful. . . . If it were not for these intervals . . . .”</p>

            <p>She looked at me and, with that extraordinary penetration which used to disconcert
                me, shook her head.</p>

            <p>“No. She would not go mad.”</p>

            <p>“My dear young lady,” I cried, by way of protest, the more shocked because in my
                heart I was far from thinking Mrs. Haldin quite sane.</p>

            <p>“You don’t know what a fine, lucid intellect mother had,” continued Nathalie Haldin,
                with her calm, clear-eyed simplicity, which seemed to me always to have a quality of
                heroism.</p>

            <p>“I am sure . . . .” I murmured.</p>

            <p>“I darkened mother’s room and came out here. I’ve wanted for so long to think
                quietly.”</p>

            <p>She paused, then, without giving any sign of distress, added, “It’s so difficult,”
                and looked at me with a strange fixity, as if watching for a sign of dissent or
                surprise.</p>

            <p>I gave neither. I was irresistibly impelled to say —</p>

            <p>“The visit from that gentleman has not made it any easier, I fear.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin stood before me with a peculiar expression in her eyes.</p>

            <p>“I don’t pretend to understand completely. Some guide one must have, even if one does
                not wholly give up the direction of one’s conduct to him. I am an inexperienced
                girl, but I am not slavish, There has been too much of that in Russia. Why should I
                not listen to him? There is no harm in having one’s thoughts directed. But I don’t
                mind confessing to you that I have not been completely candid with Peter Ivanovitch.
                I don’t quite know what prevented me at the moment . . . .”</p>

            <p>She walked away suddenly from me to a distant part of the room; but it was only to
                open and shut a drawer in a bureau. She returned with a piece of paper in her hand.
                It was thin and blackened with close handwriting. It was obviously a letter.</p>

            <p>“I wanted to read you the very words,” she said. “This is one of my poor brother’s
                letters. He never doubted. How could he doubt? They make only such a small handful,
                these miserable oppressors, before the unanimous will of our people.”</p>

            <p>“Your brother believed in the power of a people’s will to achieve anything?”</p>

            <p>“It was his religion,” declared Miss Haldin.</p>

            <p>I looked at her calm face and her animated eyes.</p>

            <p>“Of course the will must be awakened, inspired, concentrated,” she went on. “That is
                the true task of real agitators. One has got to give up one’s life to it. The
                degradation of servitude, the absolutist lies must be uprooted and swept out. Reform
                is impossible. There is nothing to reform. There is no legality, there are no
                institutions. There are only arbitrary decrees. There is only a handful of cruel —
                perhaps blind- -officials against a nation.”</p>

            <p>The letter rustled slightly in her hand. I glanced down at the flimsy blackened pages
                whose very handwriting seemed cabalistic, incomprehensible to the experience of
                Western Europe.</p>

            <p>“Stated like this,” I confessed, “the problem seems simple enough. But I fear I shall
                not see it solved. And if you go back to Russia I know that I shall not see you
                again. Yet once more I say: go back! Don’t suppose that I am thinking of your
                preservation. No! I know that you will not be returning to personal safety. But I
                had much rather think of you in danger there than see you exposed to what may be met
                here.”</p>

            <p>“I tell you what,” said Miss Haldin, after a moment of reflection. “I believe that
                you hate revolution; you fancy it’s not quite honest. You belong to a people which
                has made a bargain with fate and wouldn’t like to be rude to it. But we have made no
                bargain. It was never offered to us — so much liberty for so much hard cash. You
                shrink from the idea of revolutionary action for those you think well of as if it
                were something — how shall I say it — not quite decent.”</p>

            <p>I bowed my head.</p>

            <p>“You are quite right,” I said. “I think very highly of you”</p>

            <p>“Don’t suppose I do not know it,” she began hurriedly. “Your friendship has been very
                valuable.”</p>

            <p>“I have done little else but look on.”</p>

            <p>She was a little flushed under the eyes.</p>

            <p>“There is a way of looking on which is valuable I have felt less lonely because of
                it. It’s difficult to explain.”</p>

            <p>“Really? Well, I too have felt less lonely. That’s easy to explain, though. But it
                won’t go on much longer. The last thing I want to tell you is this: in a real
                revolution — not a simple dynastic change or a mere reform of institutions- -in a
                real revolution the best characters do not come to the front. A violent revolution
                falls into the hands of narrow-minded fanatics and of tyrannical hypocrites at
                first. Afterwards comes the turn of all the pretentious intellectual failures of the
                time. Such are the chiefs and the leaders. You will notice that I have left out the
                mere rogues. The scrupulous and the just, the noble, humane, and devoted natures;
                the unselfish and the intelligent may begin a movement — but it passes away from
                them. They are not the leaders of a revolution. They are its victims: the victims of
                disgust, of disenchantment — often of remorse. Hopes grotesquely betrayed, ideals
                caricatured — that is the definition of revolutionary success. There have been in
                every revolution hearts broken by such successes. But enough of that. My meaning is
                that I don’t want you to be a victim.”</p>

            <p>“If I could believe all you have said I still wouldn’t think of myself,” protested
                Miss Haldin. “I would take liberty from any hand as a hungry man would snatch at a
                piece of bread. The true progress must begin after. And for that the right men shall
                be found. They are already amongst us. One comes upon them in their obscurity,
                unknown, preparing themselves . . . .”</p>

            <p>She spread out the letter she had kept in her hand all the time, and looking down at
                it —</p>

            <p>“Yes! One comes upon such men!” she repeated, and then read out the words,
                “Unstained, lofty, and solitary existences.”</p>

            <p>Folding up the letter, while I looked at her interrogatively, she explained —</p>

            <p>“These are the words which my brother applies to a young man he came to know in St.
                Petersburg. An intimate friend, I suppose. It must be. His is the only name my
                brother mentions in all his correspondence with me. Absolutely the only one, and —
                would you believe it? — the man is here. He arrived recently in Geneva.”</p>

            <p>“Have you seen him?” I inquired. “But, of course; you must have seen him.”</p>

            <p>“No! No! I haven’t! I didn’t know he was here. It’s Peter Ivanovitch himself who told
                me. You have heard him yourself mentioning a new arrival from Petersburg. . . .
                Well, that is the man of ‘unstained, lofty, and solitary existence.’ My brother’s
                friend!”</p>

            <p>“Compromised politically, I suppose,” I remarked.</p>

            <p>“I don’t know. Yes. It must be so. Who knows! Perhaps it was this very friendship
                with my brother which. . . . But no! It is scarcely possible. Really, I know nothing
                except what Peter Ivanovitch told me of him. He has brought a letter of introduction
                from Father Zosim — you know, the priest-democrat; you have heard of Father
                Zosim?”</p>

            <p>“Oh yes. The famous Father Zosim was staying here in Geneva for some two months about
                a year ago,” I said. “ When he left here he seems to have disappeared from the
                world.”</p>

            <p>“It appears that he is at work in Russia again. Somewhere in the centre,” Miss Haldin
                said, with animation. “But please don’t mention that to any one — don’t let it slip
                from you, because if it got into the papers it would be dangerous for him.”</p>

            <p>“You are anxious, of course, to meet that friend of your brother?” I asked.</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin put the letter into her pocket. Her eyes looked beyond my shoulder at the
                door of her mother’s room.</p>

            <p>“Not here,” she murmured. “Not for the first time, at least.”</p>

            <p>After a moment of silence I said good-bye, but Miss Haldin followed me into the
                ante-room, closing the door behind us carefully.</p>

            <p>“I suppose you guess where I mean to go tomorrow?”</p>

            <p>“You have made up your mind to call on Madame de S——.”</p>

            <p>“Yes. I am going to the Chateau Borel. I must.”</p>

            <p>“What do you expect to hear there?” I asked, in a low voice.</p>

            <p>I wondered if she were not deluding herself with some impossible hope. It was not
                that, however.</p>

            <p>“Only think — such a friend. The only man mentioned in his letters. He would have
                something to give me, if nothing more than a few poor words. It may be something
                said and thought in those last days. Would you want me to turn my back on what is
                left of my poor brother — a friend?”</p>

            <p>“Certainly not,” I said. “I quite understand your pious curiosity.”</p>

            <p>“— Unstained, lofty, and solitary existences,” she murmured to herself. “There are!
                There are! Well, let me question one of them about the loved dead.”</p>

            <p>“How do you know, though, that you will meet him there? Is he staying in the Chateau
                as a guest — do you suppose?”</p>

            <p>“I can’t really tell,” she confessed. “He brought a written introduction from Father
                Zosim- -who, it seems, is a friend of Madame de S—— too. She can’t be such a
                worthless woman after all.”</p>

            <p>“There were all sorts of rumours afloat about Father Zosim himself,” I observed.</p>

            <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

            <p>“Calumny is a weapon of our government too. It’s well known. Oh yes! It is a fact
                that Father Zosim had the protection of the Governor- General of a certain province.
                We talked on the subject with my brother two years ago, I remember. But his work was
                good. And now he is proscribed. What better proof can one require. But no matter
                what that priest was or is. All that cannot affect my brother’s friend. If I don’t
                meet him there I shall ask these people for his address. And, of course, mother must
                see him too, later on. There is no guessing what he may have to tell us. It would be
                a mercy if mamma could be soothed. You know what she imagines. Some explanation
                perhaps may be found, or — or even made up, perhaps. It would be no sin.”</p>

            <p>“Certainly,” I said, “it would be no sin. It may be a mistake, though.”</p>

            <p>“I want her only to recover some of her old spirit. While she is like this I cannot
                think of anything calmly.”</p>

            <p>“Do you mean to invent some sort of pious fraud for your mother’s sake?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“Why fraud? Such a friend is sure to know something of my brother in these last days.
                He could tell us. . . . There is something in the facts which will not let me rest.
                I am certain he meant to join us abroad — that he had some plans — some great
                patriotic action in view; not only for himself, but for both of us. I trusted in
                that. I looked forward to the time! Oh! with such hope and impatience. I could have
                helped. And now suddenly this appearance of recklessness — as if he had not cared
                . . . .”</p>

            <p>She remained silent for a time, then obstinately she concluded —</p>

            <p>“I want to know . . . .”</p>

            <p>Thinking it over, later on, while I walked slowly away from the Boulevard des
                Philosophes, I asked myself critically, what precisely was it that she wanted to
                know? What I had heard of her history was enough to give me a clue. In the
                educational establishment for girls where Miss Haldin finished her studies she was
                looked upon rather unfavourably. She was suspected of holding independent views on
                matters settled by official teaching. Afterwards, when the two ladies returned to
                their country place, both mother and daughter, by speaking their minds openly on
                public events, had earned for themselves a reputation of liberalism. The three-horse
                trap of the district police-captain began to be seen frequently in their village. “I
                must keep an eye on the peasants”— so he explained his visits up at the house. “Two
                lonely ladies must be looked after a little.” He would inspect the walls as though
                he wanted to pierce them with his eyes, peer at the photographs, turn over the books
                in the drawing- room negligently, and after the usual refreshments, would depart.
                But the old priest of the village came one evening in the greatest distress and
                agitation, to confess that he — the priest — had been ordered to watch and ascertain
                in other ways too (such as using his spiritual power with the servants) all that was
                going on in the house, and especially in respect of the visitors these ladies
                received, who they were, the length of their stay, whether any of them were
                strangers to that part of the country, and so on. The poor, simple old man was in an
                agony of humiliation and terror. “I came to warn you. Be cautious in your conduct,
                for the love of God. I am burning with shame, but there is no getting out from under
                the net. I shall have to tell them what I see, because if I did not there is my
                deacon. He would make the worst of things to curry favour. And then my son-in-law,
                the husband of my Parasha, who is a writer in the Government Domain office; they
                would soon kick him out — and maybe send him away somewhere.” The old man lamented
                the necessities of the times —“when people do not agree somehow” and wiped his eyes.
                He did not wish to spend the evening of his days with a shaven head in the
                penitent’s cell of some monastery —“and subjected to all the severities of
                ecclesiastical discipline; for they would show no mercy to an old man,” he groaned.
                He became almost hysterical, and the two ladies, full of commiseration, soothed him
                the best they could before they let him go back to his cottage. But, as a matter of
                fact, they had very few visitors. The neighbours — some of them old friends — began
                to keep away; a few from timidity, others with marked disdain, being grand people
                that came only for the summer — Miss Haldin explained to me — aristocrats,
                reactionaries. It was a solitary existence for a young girl. Her relations with her
                mother were of the tenderest and most open kind; but Mrs. Haldin had seen the
                experiences of her own generation, its sufferings, its deceptions, its apostasies
                too. Her affection for her children was expressed by the suppression of all signs of
                anxiety. She maintained a heroic reserve. To Nathalie Haldin, her brother with his
                Petersburg existence, not enigmatical in the least (there could be no doubt of what
                he felt or thought) but conducted a little mysteriously, was the only visible
                representative of a proscribed liberty. All the significance of freedom, its
                indefinite promises, lived in their long discussions, which breathed the loftiest
                hope of action and faith in success. Then, suddenly, the action, the hopes, came to
                an end with the details ferreted out by the English journalist. The concrete fact,
                the fact of his death remained! but it remained obscure in its deeper causes. She
                felt herself abandoned without explanation. But she did not suspect him. What she
                wanted was to learn almost at any cost how she could remain faithful to his departed
                spirit.</p>

            <head>4</head>


            <p>Several days elapsed before I met Nathalie Haldin again. I was crossing the place in
                front of the theatre when I made out her shapely figure in the very act of turning
                between the gate pillars of the unattractive public promenade of the Bastions. She
                walked away from me, but I knew we should meet as she returned down the main alley —
                unless, indeed, she were going home. In that case, I don’t think I should have
                called on her yet. My desire to keep her away from these people was as strong as
                ever, but I had no illusions as to my power. I was but a Westerner, and it was clear
                that Miss Haldin would not, could not listen to my wisdom; and as to my desire of
                listening to her voice, it were better, I thought, not to indulge overmuch in that
                pleasure. No, I should not have gone to the Boulevard des Philosophes; but when at
                about the middle of the principal alley I saw Miss Haldin coming towards me, I was
                too curious, and too honest, perhaps, to run away.</p>

            <p>There was something of the spring harshness in the air. The blue sky was hard, but
                the young leaves clung like soft mist about the uninteresting range of trees; and
                the clear sun put little points of gold into the grey of Miss Haldin’s frank eyes,
                turned to me with a friendly greeting.</p>

            <p>I inquired after the health of her mother.</p>

            <p>She had a slight movement of the shoulders and a little sad sigh.</p>

            <p>“But, you see, I did come out for a walk. . .for exercise, as you English say.”</p>

            <p>I smiled approvingly, and she added an unexpected remark —</p>

            <p>“It is a glorious day.”</p>

            <p>Her voice, slightly harsh, but fascinating with its masculine and bird-like quality,
                had the accent of spontaneous conviction. I was glad of it. It was as though she had
                become aware of her youth — for there was but little of spring- like glory in the
                rectangular railed space of grass and trees, framed visibly by the orderly
                roof-slopes of that town, comely without grace, and hospitable without sympathy. In
                the very air through which she moved there was but little warmth; and the sky, the
                sky of a land without horizons, swept and washed clean by the April showers,
                extended a cold cruel blue, without elevation, narrowed suddenly by the ugly, dark
                wall of the Jura where, here and there, lingered yet a few miserable trails and
                patches of snow. All the glory of the season must have been within herself — and I
                was glad this feeling had come into her life, if only for a little time.</p>

            <p>“I am pleased to hear you say these words.” She gave me a quick look. Quick, not
                stealthy. If there was one thing of which she was absolutely incapable, it was
                stealthiness, Her sincerity was expressed in the very rhythm of her walk. It was I
                who was looking at her covertly — if I may say so. I knew where she had been, but I
                did not know what she had seen and heard in that nest of aristocratic conspiracies.
                I use the word aristocratic, for want of a better term. The Chateau Borel, embowered
                in the trees and thickets of its neglected grounds, had its fame in our day, like
                the residence of that other dangerous and exiled woman, Madame de Stael, in the
                Napoleonic era. Only the Napoleonic despotism, the booted heir of the Revolution,
                which counted that intellectual woman for an enemy worthy to be watched, was
                something quite unlike the autocracy in mystic vestments, engendered by the slavery
                of a Tartar conquest. And Madame de S—— was very far from resembling the gifted
                author of <hi>Corinne</hi>. She made a great noise about being persecuted. I don’t
                know if she were regarded in certain circles as dangerous. As to being watched, I
                imagine that the Chateau Borel could be subjected only to a most distant
                observation. It was in its exclusiveness an ideal abode for hatching superior plots
                — whether serious or futile. But all this did not interest me. I wanted to know the
                effect its extraordinary inhabitants and its special atmosphere had produced on a
                girl like Miss Haldin, so true, so honest, but so dangerously inexperienced! Her
                unconsciously lofty ignorance of the baser instincts of mankind left her disarmed
                before her own impulses. And there was also that friend of her brother, the
                significant new arrival from Russia. . . . I wondered whether she had managed to
                meet him.</p>

            <p>We walked for some time, slowly and in silence.</p>

            <p>“You know,” I attacked her suddenly, “if you don’t intend telling me anything, you
                must say so distinctly, and then, of course, it shall be final. But I won’t play at
                delicacy. I ask you point-blank for all the details.”</p>

            <p>She smiled faintly at my threatening tone.</p>

            <p>“You are as curious as a child.”</p>

            <p>“No. I am only an anxious old man,” I replied earnestly.</p>

            <p>She rested her glance on me as if to ascertain the degree of my anxiety or the number
                of my years. My physiognomy has never been expressive, I believe, and as to my years
                I am not ancient enough as yet to be strikingly decrepit. I have no long beard like
                the good hermit of a romantic ballad; my footsteps are not tottering, my aspect not
                that of a slow, venerable sage. Those picturesque advantages are not mine. I am old,
                alas, in a brisk, commonplace way. And it seemed to me as though there were some
                pity for me in Miss Haldin’s prolonged glance. She stepped out a little quicker.</p>

            <p>“You ask for all the details. Let me see. I ought to remember them. It was novel
                enough for a — a village girl like me.”</p>

            <p>After a moment of silence she began by saying that the Chateau Borel was almost as
                neglected inside as outside. It was nothing to wonder at, a Hamburg banker, I
                believe, retired from business, had it built to cheer his remaining days by the view
                of that lake whose precise, orderly, and well-to-do beauty must have been attractive
                to the unromantic imagination of a business man. But he died soon. His wife departed
                too (but only to Italy), and this house of moneyed ease, presumably unsaleable, had
                stood empty for several years. One went to it up a gravel drive, round a large,
                coarse grass- plot, with plenty of time to observe the degradation of its stuccoed
                front. Miss Haldin said that the impression was unpleasant. It grew more depressing
                as one came nearer.</p>

            <p>She observed green stains of moss on the steps of the terrace. The front door stood
                wide open. There was no one about. She found herself in a wide, lofty, and
                absolutely empty hall, with a good many doors. These doors were all shut. A broad,
                bare stone staircase faced her, and the effect of the whole was of an untenanted
                house. She stood still, disconcerted by the solitude, but after a while she became
                aware of a voice speaking continuously somewhere.</p>

            <p>“You were probably being observed all the time,” I suggested. “ There must have been
                eyes.”</p>

            <p>“I don’t see how that could be,” she retorted. “I haven’t seen even a bird in the
                grounds. I don’t remember hearing a single twitter in the trees. The whole place
                appeared utterly deserted except for the voice.”</p>

            <p>She could not make out the language — Russian, French, or German. No one seemed to
                answer it. It was as though the voice had been left behind by the departed
                inhabitants to talk to the bare walls. It went on volubly, with a pause now and
                then. It was lonely and sad. The time seemed very long to Miss Haldin. An invincible
                repugnance prevented her from opening one of the doors in the hall. It was so
                hopeless. No one would come, the voice would never stop. She confessed to me that
                she had to resist an impulse to turn round and go away unseen, as she had come.</p>

            <p>‘‘Really? You had that impulse?” I cried, full of regret. “What a pity you did not
                obey it.”</p>

            <p>She shook her head.</p>

            <p>“What a strange memory it would have been for one. Those deserted grounds, that empty
                hall, that impersonal, voluble voice, and — nobody, nothing, not a soul.”</p>

            <p>The memory would have been unique and harmless. But she was not a girl to run away
                from an intimidating impression of solitude and mystery. “No, I did not run away,”
                she said. “I stayed where I was — and I did see a soul. Such a strange soul.”</p>

            <p>As she was gazing up the broad staircase, and had concluded that the voice came from
                somewhere above, a rustle of dress attracted her attention. She looked down and saw
                a woman crossing the hall, having issued apparently through one of the many doors.
                Her face was averted, so that at first she was not aware of Miss Haldin.</p>

            <p>On turning her head and seeing a stranger, she appeared very much startled. From her
                slender figure Miss Haldin had taken her for a young girl; but if her face was
                almost childishly round, it was also sallow and wrinkled, with dark rings under the
                eyes. A thick crop of dusty brown hair was parted boyishly on the side with a
                lateral wave above the dry, furrowed forehead. After a moment of dumb blinking, she
                suddenly squatted down on the floor.</p>

            <p>“What do you mean by squatted down?” I asked, astonished. “This is a very strange
                detail.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin explained the reason. This person when first seen was carrying a small
                bowl in her hand. She had squatted down to put it on the floor for the benefit of a
                large cat, which appeared then from behind her skirts, and hid its head into the
                bowl greedily. She got up, and approaching Miss Haldin asked with nervous
                bluntness —</p>

            <p>“What do you want? Who are you?”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin mentioned her name and also the name of Peter Ivanovitch. The girlish,
                elderly woman nodded and puckered her face into a momentary expression of sympathy.
                Her black silk blouse was old and even frayed in places; the black serge skirt was
                short and shabby. She continued to blink at close quarters, and her eyelashes and
                eyebrows seemed shabby too. Miss Haldin, speaking gently to her, as if to an unhappy
                and sensitive person, explained how it was that her visit could not be an altogether
                unexpected event to Madame de S——.</p>

            <p>“Ah! Peter Ivanovitch brought you an invitation. How was I to know? A <hi>dame de
                    compangnie</hi> is not consulted, as you may imagine.”</p>

            <p>The shabby woman laughed a little. Her teeth, splendidly white and admirably even,
                looked absurdly out of place, like a string of pearls on the neck of a ragged tramp.
                “Peter Ivanovitch is the greatest genius of the century perhaps, but he is the most
                inconsiderate man living. So if you have an appointment with him you must not be
                surprised to hear that he is not here.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin explained that she had no appointment with Peter Ivanovitch. She became
                interested at once in that bizarre person.</p>

            <p>“Why should he put himself out for you or any one else? Oh! these geniuses. If you
                only knew! Yes! And their books — I mean, of course, the books that the world
                admires, the inspired books. But you have not been behind the scenes. Wait till you
                have to sit at a table for a half a day with a pen in your hand. He can walk up and
                down his rooms for hours and hours. I used to get so stiff and numb that I was
                afraid I would lose my balance and fall off the chair all at once.”</p>

            <p>She kept her hands folded in front of her, and her eyes, fixed on Miss Haldin’s face,
                betrayed no animation whatever. Miss Haldin, gathering that the lady who called
                herself a <hi>dame de compangnie</hi> was proud of having acted as secretary to
                Peter Ivanovitch, made an amiable remark.</p>

            <p>“You could not imagine a more trying experience,” declared the lady. “There is an
                Anglo-American journalist interviewing Madame de S—— now, or I would take you up,”
                she continued in a changed tone and glancing towards the staircase. “I act as master
                of ceremonies.”</p>

            <p>It appeared that Madame de S—— could not bear Swiss servants about her person; and,
                indeed, servants would not stay for very long in the Chateau Borel. There were
                always difficulties. Miss Haldin had already noticed that the hall was like a dusty
                barn of marble and stucco with cobwebs in the corners and faint tracks of mud on the
                black and white tessellated floor.</p>

            <p>“I look also after this animal,” continued the <hi>dame de compagnie</hi>, keeping
                her hands folded quietly in front of her; and she bent her worn gaze upon the cat.
                “I don’t mind a bit. Animals have their rights; though, strictly speaking, I see no
                reason why they should not suffer as well as human beings. Do you? But of course
                they never suffer so much. That is impossible. Only, in their case it is more
                pitiful because they cannot make a revolution. I used to be a Republican. I suppose
                you are a Republican?”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin confessed to me that she did not know what to say. But she nodded
                slightly, and asked in her turn —</p>

            <p>“And are you no longer a Republican?”</p>

            <p>“After taking down Peter Ivanovitch from dictation for two years, it is difficult for
                me to be anything. First of all, you have to sit perfectly motionless. The slightest
                movement you make puts to flight the ideas of Peter Ivanovitch. You hardly dare to
                breathe. And as to coughing — God forbid! Peter Ivanovitch changed the position of
                the table to the wall because at first I could not help raising my eyes to look out
                of the window, while waiting for him to go on with his dictation. That was not
                allowed. He said I stared so stupidly. I was likewise not permitted to look at him
                over my shoulder. Instantly Peter Ivanovitch stamped his foot, and would roar, ‘Look
                down on the paper!’ It seems my expression, my face, put him off. Well, I know that
                I am not beautiful, and that my expression is not hopeful either. He said that my
                air of unintelligent expectation irritated him. These are his own words.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin was shocked, but admitted to me that she was not altogether
                surprised.</p>

            <p>“Is it possible that Peter Ivanovitch could treat any woman so rudely?” she
                cried.</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> nodded several times with an air of discretion, then
                assured Miss Haldin that she did not mind in the least. The trying part of it was to
                have the secret of the composition laid bare before her; to see the great author of
                the revolutionary gospels grope for words as if he were in the dark as to what he
                meant to say.</p>

            <p>“I am quite willing to be the blind instrument of higher ends. To give one’s life for
                the cause is nothing. But to have one’s illusions destroyed — that is really almost
                more than one can bear. I really don’t exaggerate,” she insisted. “It seemed to
                freeze my very beliefs in me — the more so that when we worked in winter Peter
                Ivanovitch, walking up and down the room, required no artificial heat to keep
                himself warm. Even when we move to the South of France there are bitterly cold days,
                especially when you have to sit still for six hours at a stretch. The walls of these
                villas on the Riviera are so flimsy. Peter Ivanovitch did not seem to be aware of
                anything. It is true that I kept down my shivers from fear of putting him out. I
                used to set my teeth till my jaws felt absolutely locked. In the moments when Peter
                Ivanovitch interrupted his dictation, and sometimes these intervals were very long —
                often twenty minutes, no less, while he walked to and fro behind my back muttering
                to himself — I felt I was dying by inches, I assure you. Perhaps if I had let my
                teeth rattle Peter Ivanovitch might have noticed my distress, but I don’t think it
                would have had any practical effect. She’s very miserly in such matters.”</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> glanced up the staircase. The big cat had finished the
                milk and was rubbing its whiskered cheek sinuously against her skirt. She dived to
                snatch it up from the floor.</p>

            <p>“Miserliness is rather a quality than otherwise, you know,” she continued, holding
                the cat in her folded arms. “With us it is misers who can spare money for worthy
                objects — not the so- called generous natures. But pray don’t think I am a sybarite.
                My father was a clerk in the Ministry of Finances with no position at all. You may
                guess by this that our home was far from luxurious, though of course we did not
                actually suffer from cold. I ran away from my parents, you know, directly I began to
                think by myself. It is not very easy, such thinking. One has got to be put in the
                way of it, awakened to the truth. I am indebted for my salvation to an old
                apple-woman, who had her stall under the gateway of the house we lived in. She had a
                kind wrinkled face, and the most friendly voice imaginable. One day, casually, we
                began to talk about a child, a ragged little girl we had seen begging from men in
                the streets at dusk; and from one thing to another my eyes began to open gradually
                to the horrors from which innocent people are made to suffer in this world, only in
                order that governments might exist. After I once understood the crime of the upper
                classes, I could not go on living with my parents. Not a single charitable word was
                to be heard in our home from year’s end to year’s end; there was nothing but the
                talk of vile office intrigues, and of promotion and of salaries, and of courting the
                favour of the chiefs. The mere idea of marrying one day such another man as my
                father made me shudder. I don’t mean that there was anyone wanting to marry me.
                There was not the slightest prospect of anything of the kind. But was it not sin
                enough to live on a Government salary while half Russia was dying of hunger? The
                Ministry of Finances! What a grotesque horror it is! What does the starving,
                ignorant people want with a Ministry of Finances? I kissed my old folks on both
                cheeks, and went away from them to live in cellars, with the proletariat. I tried to
                make myself useful to the utterly hopeless. I suppose you understand what I mean? I
                mean the people who have nowhere to go and nothing to look forward to in this life.
                Do you understand how frightful that is — nothing to look forward to! Sometimes I
                think that it is only in Russia that there are such people and such a depth of
                misery can be reached. Well, I plunged into it, and — do you know — there isn’t much
                that one can do in there. No, indeed — at least as long as there are Ministries of
                Finances and such like grotesque horrors to stand in the way. I suppose I would have
                gone mad there just trying to fight the vermin, if it had not been for a man. It was
                my old friend and teacher, the poor saintly apple-woman, who discovered him for me,
                quite accidentally. She came to fetch me late one evening in her quiet way. I
                followed her where she would lead; that part of my life was in her hands altogether,
                and without her my spirit would have perished miserably. The man was a young
                workman, a lithographer by trade, and he had got into trouble in connexion with that
                affair of temperance tracts — you remember. There was a lot of people put in prison
                for that. The Ministry of Finances again! What would become of it if the poor folk
                ceased making beasts of themselves with drink? Upon my word, I would think that
                finances and all the rest of it are an invention of the devil; only that a belief in
                a supernatural source of evil is not necessary; men alone are quite capable of every
                wickedness. Finances indeed!”</p>

            <p>Hatred and contempt hissed in her utterance of the word “finances,” but at the very
                moment she gently stroked the cat reposing in her arms. She even raised them
                slightly, and inclining her head rubbed her cheek against the fur of the animal,
                which received this caress with the complete detachment so characteristic of its
                kind. Then looking at Miss Haldin she excused herself once more for not taking her
                upstairs to Madame S—— The interview could not be interrupted. Presently the
                journalist would be seen coming down the stairs. The best thing was to remain in the
                hall; and besides, all these rooms (she glanced all round at the many doors), all
                these rooms on the ground floor were unfurnished.</p>

            <p>“Positively there is no chair down here to offer you,” she continued. “But if you
                prefer your own thoughts to my chatter, I will sit down on the bottom step here and
                keep silent.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin hastened to assure her that, on the contrary, she was very much
                interested in the story of the journeyman lithographer. He was a revolutionist, of
                course.</p>

            <p>“A martyr, a simple man,” said the <hi>dame de compangnie</hi>, with a faint sigh,
                and gazing through the open front door dreamily. She turned her misty brown eyes on
                Miss Haldin.</p>

            <p>“I lived with him for four months. It was like a nightmare.”</p>

            <p>As Miss Haldin looked at her inquisitively she began to describe the emaciated face
                of the man, his fleshless limbs, his destitution. The room into which the
                apple-woman had led her was a tiny garret, a miserable den under the roof of a
                sordid house. The plaster fallen off the walls covered the floor, and when the door
                was opened a horrible tapestry of black cobwebs waved in the draught. He had been
                liberated a few days before — flung out of prison into the streets. And Miss Haldin
                seemed to see for the first time, a name and a face upon the body of that suffering
                people whose hard fate had been the subject of so many conversations, between her
                and her brother, in the garden of their country house.</p>

            <p>He had been arrested with scores and scores of other people in that affair of the
                lithographed temperance tracts. Unluckily, having got hold of a great many suspected
                persons, the police thought they could extract from some of them other information
                relating to the revolutionist propaganda.</p>

            <p>“They beat him so cruelly in the course of investigation,” went on the <hi>dame de
                    compagnie</hi>, “that they injured him internally. When they had done with him
                he was doomed. He could do nothing for himself. I beheld him lying on a wooden
                bedstead without any bedding, with his head on a bundle of dirty rags, lent to him
                out of charity by an old rag-picker, who happened to live in the basement of the
                house. There he was, uncovered, burning with fever, and there was not even a jug in
                the room for the water to quench his thirst with. There was nothing whatever — just
                that bedstead and the bare floor.”</p>

            <p>“Was there no one in all that great town amongst the liberals and revolutionaries, to
                extend a helping hand to a brother?” asked Miss Haldin indignantly.</p>

            <p>“Yes. But you do not know the most terrible part of that man’s misery. Listen. It
                seems that they ill-used him so atrociously that, at last, his firmness gave way,
                and he did let out some information. Poor soul, the flesh is weak, you know. What it
                was he did not tell me. There was a crushed spirit in that mangled body. Nothing I
                found to say could make him whole. When they let him out, he crept into that hole,
                and bore his remorse stoically. He would not go near anyone he knew. I would have
                sought assistance for him, but, indeed, where could I have gone looking for it?
                Where was I to look for anyone who had anything to spare or any power to help? The
                people living round us were all starving and drunken. They were the victims of the
                Ministry of Finances. Don’t ask me how we lived. I couldn’t tell you. It was like a
                miracle of wretchedness. I had nothing to sell, and I assure you my clothes were in
                such a state that it was impossible for me to go out in the daytime. I was indecent.
                I had to wait till it was dark before I ventured into the streets to beg for a crust
                of bread, or whatever I could get, to keep him and me alive. Often I got nothing,
                and then I would crawl back and lie on the floor by the side of his couch. Oh yes, I
                can sleep quite soundly on bare boards. That is nothing, and I am only mentioning it
                to you so that you should not think I am a sybarite. It was infinitely less killing
                than the task of sitting for hours at a table in a cold study to take the books of
                Peter Ivanovitch from dictation. But you shall see yourself what that is like, so I
                needn’t say any more about it.”</p>

            <p>“It is by no means certain that I will ever take Peter Ivanovitch from dictation,”
                said Miss Haldin.</p>

            <p>“No!” cried the other incredulously. “Not certain? You mean to say that you have not
                made up your mind?”</p>

            <p>When Miss Haldin assured her that there never had been any question of that between
                her and Peter Ivanovitch, the woman with the cat compressed her lips tightly for a
                moment.</p>

            <p>“Oh, you will find yourself settled at the table before you know that you have made
                up your mind. Don’t make a mistake, it is disenchanting to hear Peter Ivanovitch
                dictate, but at the same time there is a fascination about it. He is a man of
                genius. Your face is certain not to irritate him; you may perhaps even help his
                inspiration, make it easier for him to deliver his message. As I look at you, I feel
                certain that you are the kind of woman who is not likely to check the flow of his
                inspiration.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin thought it useless to protest against all these assumptions.</p>

            <p>“But this man — this workman did he die under your care?” she said, after a short
                silence.</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi>, listening up the stairs where now two voices were
                alternating with some animation, made no answer for a time. When the loud sounds of
                the discussion had sunk into an almost inaudible murmur, she turned to Miss
                Haldin.</p>

            <p>“Yes, he died, but not, literally speaking, in my arms, as you might suppose. As a
                matter of fact, I was asleep when he breathed his last. So even now I cannot say I
                have seen anybody die. A few days before the end, some young men found us out in our
                extremity. They were revolutionists, as you might guess. He ought to have trusted in
                his political friends when he came out of prison. He had been liked and respected
                before, and nobody would have dreamed of reproaching him with his indiscretion
                before the police. Everybody knows how they go to work, and the strongest man has
                his moments of weakness before pain. Why, even hunger alone is enough to give one
                queer ideas as to what may be done. A doctor came, our lot was alleviated as far as
                physical comforts go, but otherwise he could not be consoled — poor man. I assure
                you, Miss Haldin, that he was very lovable, but I had not the strength to weep. I
                was nearly dead myself. But there were kind hearts to take care of me. A dress was
                found to clothe my nakedness. I tell you, I was not decent — and after a time the
                revolutionists placed me with a Jewish family going abroad, as governess. Of course
                I could teach the children, I finished the sixth class of the Lyceum; but the real
                object was, that I should carry some important papers across the frontier. I was
                entrusted with a packet which I carried next my heart. The gendarmes at the station
                did not suspect the governess of a Jewish family, busy looking after three children.
                I don’t suppose those Hebrews knew what I had on me, for I had been introduced to
                them in a very roundabout way by persons who did not belong to the revolutionary
                movement, and naturally I had been instructed to accept a very small salary. When we
                reached Germany I left that family and delivered my papers to a revolutionist in
                Stuttgart; after this I was employed in various ways. But you do not want to hear
                all that. I have never felt that I was very useful, but I live in hopes of seeing
                all the Ministries destroyed, finances and all. The greatest joy of my life has been
                to hear what your brother has done.”</p>

            <p>She directed her round eyes again to the sunshine outside, while the cat reposed
                within her folded arms in lordly beatitude and sphinx- like meditation.</p>

            <p>“Yes! I rejoiced,” she began again. “For me there is a heroic ring about the very
                name of Haldin. They must have been trembling with fear in their Ministries — all
                those men with fiendish hearts. Here I stand talking to you, and when I think of all
                the cruelties, oppressions, and injustices that are going on at this very moment, my
                head begins to swim. I have looked closely at what would seem inconceivable if one’s
                own eyes had not to be trusted. I have looked at things that made me hate myself for
                my helplessness. I hated my hands that had no power, my voice that could not be
                heard, my very mind that would not become unhinged. Ah! I have seen things. And
                you?”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin was moved. She shook her head slightly.</p>

            <p>“No, I have seen nothing for myself as yet,” she murmured “We have always lived in
                the country. It was my brother’s wish.”</p>

            <p>“It is a curious meeting — this — between you and me,” continued the other. “Do you
                believe in chance, Miss Haldin? How could I have expected to see you, his sister,
                with my own eyes? Do you know that when the news came the revolutionaries here were
                as much surprised as pleased, every bit? No one seemed to know anything about your
                brother. Peter Ivanovitch himself had not foreseen that such a blow was going to be
                struck. I suppose your brother was simply inspired. I myself think that such deeds
                should be done by inspiration. It is a great privilege to have the inspiration and
                the opportunity. Did he resemble you at all? Don’t you rejoice, Miss Haldin?”</p>

            <p>“You must not expect too much from me,” said Miss Haldin, repressing an inclination
                to cry which came over her suddenly. She succeeded, then added calmly, “I am not a
                heroic person!”</p>

            <p>“You think you couldn’t have done such a thing yourself perhaps?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t know. I must not even ask myself till I have lived a little longer, seen
                more . . . .”</p>

            <p>The other moved her head appreciatively. The purring of the cat had a loud
                complacency in the empty hall. No sound of voices came from upstairs. Miss Haldin
                broke the silence.</p>

            <p>“What is it precisely that you heard people say about my brother? You said that they
                were surprised. Yes, I supposed they were. Did it not seem strange to them that my
                brother should have failed to save himself after the most difficult part — that is,
                getting away from the spot — was over? Conspirators should understand these things
                well. There are reasons why I am very anxious to know how it is he failed to
                escape.”</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> had advanced to the open hall-door. She glanced
                rapidly over her shoulder at Miss Haldin, who remained within the hall.</p>

            <p>“Failed to escape,” she repeated absently. “Didn’t he make the sacrifice of his life?
                Wasn’t he just simply inspired? Wasn’t it an act of abnegation? Aren’t you
                certain?”</p>

            <p>“What I am certain of,” said Miss Haldin, “is that it was not an act of despair. Have
                you not heard some opinion expressed here upon his miserable capture?”</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> mused for a while in the doorway.</p>

            <p>“Did I hear? Of course, everything is discussed here. Has not all the world been
                speaking about your brother? For my part, the mere mention of his achievement
                plunges me into an envious ecstasy. Why should a man certain of immortality think of
                his life at all?”</p>

            <p>She kept her back turned to Miss Haldin. Upstairs from behind a great dingy white and
                gold door, visible behind the balustrade of the first floor landing, a deep voice
                began to drone formally, as if reading over notes or something of the sort. It
                paused frequently, and then ceased altogether.</p>

            <p>“I don’t think I can stay any longer now,” said Miss Haldin. “I may return another
                day.”</p>

            <p>She waited for the <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> to make room for her exit; but the
                woman appeared lost in the contemplation of sunshine and shadows, sharing between
                themselves the stillness of the deserted grounds. She concealed the view of the
                drive from Miss Haldin. Suddenly she said —</p>

            <p>“It will not be necessary; here is Peter Ivanovitch himself coming up. But he is not
                alone. He is seldom alone now.”</p>

            <p>Hearing that Peter Ivanovitch was approaching, Miss Haldin was not so pleased as she
                might have been expected to be. Somehow she had lost the desire to see either the
                heroic captive or Madame de S— — and the reason of that shrinking which came upon
                her at the very last minute is accounted for by the feeling that those two people
                had not been treating the woman with the cat kindly.</p>

            <p>“Would you please let me pass?” said Miss Haldin at last, touching lightly the
                shoulder of the <hi>dame de compagnie</hi>.</p>

            <p>But the other, pressing the cat to her breast, did not budge.</p>

            <p>“I know who is with him,” she said, without even looking back.</p>

            <p>More unaccountably than ever Miss Haldin felt a strong impulse to leave the
                house.</p>

            <p>“Madame de S—— may be engaged for some time yet, and what I have got to say to Peter
                Ivanovitch is just a simple question which I might put to him when I meet him in the
                grounds on my way down. I really think I must go. I have been some time here, and I
                am anxious to get back to my mother. Will you let me pass, please?”</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> turned her head at last.</p>

            <p>“I never supposed that you really wanted to see Madame de S— — ” she said, with
                unexpected insight. “Not for a moment.” There was something confidential and
                mysterious in her tone. She passed through the door, with Miss Haldin following her,
                on to the terrace, and they descended side by side the moss-grown stone steps. There
                was no one to be seen on the part of the drive visible from the front of the
                house.</p>

            <p>“They are hidden by the trees over there,” explained Miss Haldin’s new acquaintance,
                “but you shall see them directly. I don’t know who that young man is to whom Peter
                Ivanovitch has taken such a fancy. He must be one of us, or he would not be admitted
                here when the others come. You know what I mean by the others. But I must say that
                he is not at all mystically inclined. I don’t know that I have made him out yet.
                Naturally I am never for very long in the drawing-room. There is always something to
                do for me, though the establishment here is not so extensive as the villa on the
                Riviera. But still there are plenty of opportunities for me to make myself
                useful.”</p>

            <p>To the left, passing by the ivy-grown end of the stables, appeared Peter Ivanovitch
                and his companion. They walked very slowly, conversing with some animation. They
                stopped for a moment, and Peter Ivanovitch was seen to gesticulate, while the young
                man listened motionless, with his arms hanging down and his head bowed a little. He
                was dressed in a dark brown suit and a black hat. The round eyes of the <hi>dame de
                    compagnie</hi> remained fixed on the two figures, which had resumed their
                leisurely approach.</p>

            <p>“An extremely polite young man,” she said. “You shall see what a bow he will make;
                and it won’t altogether be so exceptional either. He bows in the same way when he
                meets me alone in the hall.”</p>

            <p>She moved on a few steps, with Miss Haldin by her side, and things happened just as
                she had foretold. The young man took off his hat, bowed and fell back, while Peter
                Ivanovitch advanced quicker, his black, thick arms extended heartily, and seized
                hold of both Miss Haldin’s hands, shook them, and peered at her through his dark
                glasses.</p>

            <p>“That’s right, that’s right!” he exclaimed twice, approvingly. “And so you have been
                looked after by . . . .” He frowned slightly at the <hi>dame de compagnie</hi>, who
                was still nursing the cat. “I conclude Eleanor — Madame de S—— is engaged. I know
                she expected somebody to-day. So the newspaper man did turn up, eh? She is
                engaged?”</p>

            <p>For all answer the <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> turned away her head.</p>

            <p>“It is very unfortunate — very unfortunate indeed. I very much regret that you should
                have been . . . .” He lowered suddenly his voice. “But what is it — surely you are
                not departing, Natalia Victorovna? You got bored waiting, didn’t you?”</p>

            <p>“Not in the least,” Miss Haldin protested. “Only I have been here some time, and I am
                anxious to get back to my mother.”</p>

            <p>“The time seemed long, eh? I am afraid our worthy friend here” (Peter Ivanovitch
                suddenly jerked his head sideways towards his right shoulder and jerked it up again)
                — “our worthy friend here has not the art of shortening the moments of waiting. No,
                distinctly she has not the art; and in that respect good intentions alone count for
                nothing.”</p>

            <p>The <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> dropped her arms, and the cat found itself suddenly on
                the ground. It remained quite still after alighting, one hind leg stretched
                backwards. Miss Haldin was extremely indignant on behalf of the lady companion.</p>

            <p>“Believe me, Peter Ivanovitch, that the moments I have passed in the hall of this
                house have been not a little interesting, and very instructive too. They are
                memorable. I do not regret the waiting, but I see that the object of my call here
                can be attained without taking up Madame de S——‘s time.”</p>

            <p>At this point I interrupted Miss Haldin. The above relation is founded on her
                narrative, which I have not so much dramatized as might be supposed. She had
                rendered, with extraordinary feeling and animation, the very accent almost of the
                disciple of the old apple-woman, the irreconcilable hater of Ministries, the
                voluntary servant of the poor. Miss Haldin’s true and delicate humanity had been
                extremely shocked by the uncongenial fate of her new acquaintance, that lady
                companion, secretary, whatever she was. For my own part, I was pleased to discover
                in it one more obstacle to intimacy with Madame de S——. I had a positive abhorrence
                for the painted, bedizened, dead- faced, glassy-eyed Egeria of Peter Ivanovitch. I
                do not know what was her attitude to the unseen, but I know that in the affairs of
                this world she was avaricious, greedy, and unscrupulous. It was within my knowledge
                that she had been worsted in a sordid and desperate quarrel about money matters with
                the family of her late husband, the diplomatist. Some very august personages indeed
                (whom in her fury she had insisted upon scandalously involving in her affairs) had
                incurred her animosity. I find it perfectly easy to believe that she had come to
                within an ace of being spirited away, for reasons of state, into some discreet
                    <hi>maison de sante</hi> — a madhouse of sorts, to be plain. It appears,
                however, that certain high-placed personages opposed it for reasons which . . .
                .</p>

            <p>But it’s no use to go into details.</p>

            <p>Wonder may be expressed at a man in the position of a teacher of languages knowing
                all this with such definiteness. A novelist says this and that of his personages,
                and if only he knows how to say it earnestly enough he may not be questioned upon
                the inventions of his brain in which his own belief is made sufficiently manifest by
                a telling phrase, a poetic image, the accent of emotion. Art is great! But I have no
                art, and not having invented Madame de S- — I feel bound to explain how I came to
                know so much about her.</p>

            <p>My informant was the Russian wife of a friend of mine already mentioned, the
                professor of Lausanne University. It was from her that I learned the last fact of
                Madame de S——‘s history, with which I intend to trouble my readers. She told me,
                speaking positively, as a person who trusts her sources, of the cause of Madame de
                S——‘s flight from Russia, some years before. It was neither more nor less than this:
                that she became suspect to the police in connexion with the assassination of the
                Emperor Alexander. The ground of this suspicion was either some unguarded
                expressions that escaped her in public, or some talk overheard in her salon.
                Overheard, we must believe, by some guest, perhaps a friend, who hastened to play
                the informer, I suppose. At any rate, the overheard matter seemed to imply her
                foreknowledge of that event, and I think she was wise in not waiting for the
                investigation of such a charge. Some of my readers may remember a little book from
                her pen, published in Paris, a mystically bad-tempered, declamatory, and frightfully
                disconnected piece of writing, in which she all but admits the foreknowledge, more
                than hints at its supernatural origin, and plainly suggests in venomous innuendoes
                that the guilt of the act was not with the terrorists, but with a palace intrigue.
                When I observed to my friend, the professor’s wife, that the life of Madame de S— —
                with its unofficial diplomacy, its intrigues, lawsuits, favours, disgrace,
                expulsions, its atmosphere of scandal, occultism, and charlatanism, was more fit for
                the eighteenth century than for the conditions of our own time, she assented with a
                smile, but a moment after went on in a reflective tone: “Charlatanism? — yes, in a
                certain measure. Still, times are changed. There are forces now which were
                non-existent in the eighteenth century. I should not be surprised if she were more
                dangerous than an Englishman would be willing to believe. And what’s more, she is
                looked upon as really dangerous by certain people — <hi>chez nous</hi>.”</p>

            <p><hi>Chez nous</hi> in this connexion meant Russia in general, and the Russian
                political police in particular. The object of my digression from the straight course
                of Miss Haldin’s relation (in my own words) of her visit to the Chateau Borel, was
                to bring forward that statement of my friend, the professor’s wife. I wanted to
                bring it forward simply to make what I have to say presently of Mr. Razumov’s
                presence in Geneva, a little more credible — for this is a Russian story for Western
                ears, which, as I have observed already, are not attuned to certain tones of
                cynicism and cruelty, of moral negation, and even of moral distress already silenced
                at our end of Europe. And this I state as my excuse for having left Miss Haldin
                standing, one of the little group of two women and two men who had come together
                below the terrace of the Chateau Borel.</p>

            <p>The knowledge which I have just stated was in my mind when, as I have said, I
                interrupted Miss Haldin. I interrupted her with the cry of profound
                satisfaction —</p>

            <p>“So you never saw Madame de S— — after all?”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin shook her head. It was very satisfactory to me. She had not seen Madame
                de S——! That was excellent, excellent! I welcomed the conviction that she would
                never know Madame de S—— now. I could not explain the reason of the conviction but
                by the knowledge that Miss Haldin was standing face to face with her brother’s
                wonderful friend. I preferred him to Madame de S—— as the companion and guide of
                that young girl, abandoned to her inexperience by the miserable end of her brother.
                But, at any rate, that life now ended had been sincere, and perhaps its thoughts
                might have been lofty, its moral sufferings profound, its last act a true sacrifice.
                It is not for us, the staid lovers calmed by the possession of a conquered liberty,
                to condemn without appeal the fierceness of thwarted desire.</p>

            <p>I am not ashamed of the warmth of my regard for Miss Haldin. It was, it must be
                admitted, an unselfish sentiment, being its own reward. The late Victor Haldin — in
                the light of that sentiment — appeared to me not as a sinister conspirator, but as a
                pure enthusiast. I did not wish indeed to judge him, but the very fact that he did
                not escape, that fact which brought so much trouble to both his mother and his
                sister, spoke to me in his favour. Meantime, in my fear of seeing the girl surrender
                to the influence of the Chateau Borel revolutionary feminism, I was more than
                willing to put my trust in that friend of the late Victor Haldin. He was nothing but
                a name, you will say. Exactly! A name! And what’s more, the only name; the only name
                to be found in the correspondence between brother and sister. The young man had
                turned up; they had come face to face, and, fortunately, without the direct
                interference of Madame de S——. What will come of it? what will she tell me
                presently? I was asking myself.</p>

            <p>It was only natural that my thought should turn to the young man, the bearer of the
                only name uttered in all the dream-talk of a future to be brought about by a
                revolution. And my thought took the shape of asking myself why this young man had
                not called upon these ladies. He had been in Geneva for some days before Miss Haldin
                heard of him first in my presence from Peter Ivanovitch. I regretted that last’s
                presence at their meeting. I would rather have had it happen somewhere out of his
                spectacled sight. But I supposed that, having both these young people there, he
                introduced them to each other.</p>

            <p>I broke the silence by beginning a question on that point —</p>

            <p>“I suppose Peter Ivanovitch . . . .”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin gave vent to her indignation. Peter Ivanovitch directly he had got his
                answer from her had turned upon the <hi>dame de compagnie</hi> in a shameful
                manner.</p>

            <p>“Turned upon her?” I wondered. “What about? For what reason? ”</p>

            <p>“It was unheard of; it was shameful,” Miss Haldin pursued, with angry eyes. “ <hi>Il
                    lui a fait une scene</hi> — like this, before strangers. And for what? You would
                never guess. For some eggs. . . . Oh!”</p>

            <p>I was astonished. “Eggs, did you say?”</p>

            <p>“For Madame de S——. That lady observes a special diet, or something of the sort. It
                seems she complained the day before to Peter Ivanovitch that the eggs were not
                rightly prepared. Peter Ivanovitch suddenly remembered this against the poor woman,
                and flew out at her. It was most astonishing. I stood as if rooted.”</p>

            <p>“Do you mean to say that the great feminist allowed himself to be abusive to a
                woman?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“Oh, not that! It was something you have no conception of. It was an odious
                performance. Imagine, he raised his hat to begin with. He made his voice soft and
                deprecatory. ‘Ah! you are not kind to us — you will not deign to remember . . . .’
                This sort of phrases, that sort of tone. The poor creature was terribly upset. Her
                eyes ran full of tears. She did not know where to look. I shouldn’t wonder if she
                would have preferred abuse, or even a blow.”</p>

            <p>I did not remark that very possibly she was familiar with both on occasions when no
                one was by. Miss Haldin walked by my side, her head up in scornful and angry
                silence.</p>

            <p>“Great men have their surprising peculiarities,” I observed inanely. “Exactly like
                men who are not great. But that sort of thing cannot be kept up for ever. How did
                the great feminist wind up this very characteristic episode?”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin, without turning her face my way, told me that the end was brought about
                by the appearance of the interviewer, who had been closeted with Madame de S——.</p>

            <p>He came up rapidly, unnoticed, lifted his hat slightly, and paused to say in French:
                “The Baroness has asked me, in case I met a lady on my way out, to desire her to
                come in at once.”</p>

            <p>After delivering this message, he hurried down the drive. The <hi>dame de
                    compagnie</hi> flew towards the house, and Peter Ivanovitch followed her
                hastily, looking uneasy. In a moment Miss Haldin found herself alone with the young
                man, who undoubtedly must have been the new arrival from Russia. She wondered
                whether her brother’s friend had not already guessed who she was.</p>

            <p>I am in a position to say that, as a matter of fact, he had guessed. It is clear to
                me that Peter Ivanovitch, for some reason or other, had refrained from alluding to
                these ladies’ presence in Geneva. But Razumov had guessed. The trustful girl! Every
                word uttered by Haldin lived in Razumov’s memory. They were like haunting shapes;
                they could not be exorcised. The most vivid amongst them was the mention of the
                sister. The girl had existed for him ever since. But he did not recognize her at
                once. Coming up with Peter Ivanovitch, he did observe her; their eyes had met, even.
                He had responded, as no one could help responding, to the harmonious charm of her
                whole person, its strength, its grace, its tranquil frankness — and then he had
                turned his gaze away. He said to himself that all this was not for him; the beauty
                of women and the friendship of men were not for him. He accepted that feeling with a
                purposeful sternness, and tried to pass on. It was only her outstretched hand which
                brought about the recognition. It stands recorded in the pages of his
                self-confession, that it nearly suffocated him physically with an emotional reaction
                of hate and dismay, as though her appearance had been a piece of accomplished
                treachery.</p>

            <p>He faced about. The considerable elevation of the terrace concealed them from anyone
                lingering in the doorway of the house; and even from the upstairs windows they could
                not have been seen. Through the thickets run wild, and the trees of the gently
                sloping grounds, he had cold, placid glimpses of the lake. A moment of perfect
                privacy had been vouchsafed to them at this juncture. I wondered to myself what use
                they had made of that fortunate circumstance.</p>

            <p>“Did you have time for more than a few words?” I asked.</p>

            <p>That animation with which she had related to me the incidents of her visit to the
                Chateau Borel had left her completely. Strolling by my side, she looked straight
                before her; but I noticed a little colour on her cheek. She did not answer me.</p>

            <p>After some little time I observed that they could not have hoped to remain forgotten
                for very long, unless the other two had discovered Madame de S—— swooning with
                fatigue, perhaps, or in a state of morbid exaltation after the long interview.
                Either would require their devoted ministrations. I could depict to myself Peter
                Ivanovitch rushing busily out of the house again, bareheaded, perhaps, and on across
                the terrace with his swinging gait, the black skirts of the frock-coat floating
                clear of his stout light grey legs. I confess to having looked upon these young
                people as the quarry of the “heroic fugitive.” I had the notion that they would not
                be allowed to escape capture. But of that I said nothing to Miss Haldin, only as she
                still remained uncommunicative, I pressed her a little.</p>

            <p>“Well — but you can tell me at least your impression.”</p>

            <p>She turned her head to look at me, and turned away again.</p>

            <p>“Impression?” she repeated slowly, almost dreamily; then in a quicker tone —</p>

            <p>“He seems to be a man who has suffered more from his thoughts than from evil
                fortune.”</p>

            <p>“From his thoughts, you say?”</p>

            <p>“And that is natural enough in a Russian,” she took me up.” In a young Russian; so
                many of them are unfit for action, and yet unable to rest.”</p>

            <p>“And you think he is that sort of man?”</p>

            <p>“No, I do not judge him. How could I, so suddenly? You asked for my impression — I
                explain my impression. I— I— don’t know the world, nor yet the people in it; I have
                been too solitary — I am too young to trust my own opinions.”</p>

            <p>“Trust your instinct,” I advised her. “Most women trust to that, and make no worse
                mistakes than men. In this case you have your brother’s letter to help you”</p>

            <p>She drew a deep breath like a light sigh. “Unstained, lofty, and solitary
                existences,” she quoted as if to herself. But I caught the wistful murmur
                distinctly.</p>

            <p>“High praise, “I whispered to her.’’</p>

            <p>“The highest possible.”</p>

            <p>“So high that, like the award of happiness, it is more fit to come only at the end of
                a life. But still no common or altogether unworthy personality could have suggested
                such a confident exaggeration of praise and . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Ah!” She interrupted me ardently. “And if you had only known the heart from which
                that judgment has come!”</p>

            <p>She ceased on that note, and for a space I reflected on the character of the words
                which I perceived very well must tip the scale of the girl’s feelings in that young
                man’s favour. They had not the sound of a casual utterance. Vague they were to my
                Western mind and to my Western sentiment, but I could not forget that, standing by
                Miss Haldin’s side, I was like a traveller in a strange country. It had also become
                clear to me that Miss Haldin was unwilling to enter into the details of the only
                material part of their visit to the Chateau Borel. But I was not hurt. Somehow I
                didn’t feel it to be a want of confidence. It was some other difficulty — a
                difficulty I could not resent. And it was without the slightest resentment that I
                said —</p>

            <p>“Very well. But on that high ground, which I will not dispute, you, like anyone else
                in such circumstances, you must have made for yourself a representation of that
                exceptional friend, a mental image of him, and — please tell me — you were not
                disappointed?”</p>

            <p>“What do you mean? His personal appearance?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t mean precisely his good looks, or otherwise.”</p>

            <p>We turned at the end of the alley and made a few steps without looking at each
                other.</p>

            <p>“His appearance is not ordinary,” said Miss Haldin at last.</p>

            <p>“No, I should have thought not — from the little you’ve said of your first
                impression. After all, one has to fall back on that word. Impression! What I mean is
                that something indescribable which is likely to mark a ‘not ordinary’ person.”</p>

            <p>I perceived that she was not listening. There was no mistaking her expression; and
                once more I had the sense of being out of it — not because of my age, which at any
                rate could draw inferences — but altogether out of it, on another plane whence I
                could only watch her from afar. And so ceasing to speak I watched her stepping out
                by my side.</p>

            <p>“No, she exclaimed suddenly, “I could not have been disappointed with a man of such
                strong feeling.”</p>

            <p>“Aha! Strong feeling, “I muttered, thinking to myself censoriously: like this, at
                once, all in a moment!</p>

            <p>“What did you say?” inquired Miss Haldin innocently.</p>

            <p>“Oh, nothing. I beg your pardon. Strong feeling. I am not surprised.”</p>

            <p>“And you don’t know how abruptly I behaved to him!” she cried remorsefully.</p>

            <p>I suppose I must have appeared surprised, for, looking at me with a still more
                heightened colour, she said she was ashamed to admit that she had not been
                sufficiently collected; she had failed to control her words and actions as the
                situation demanded. She lost the fortitude worthy of both the men, the dead and the
                living; the fortitude which should have been the note of the meeting of Victor
                Haldin’s sister with Victor Haldin’s only known friend. He was looking at her
                keenly, but said nothing, and she was — she confessed — painfully affected by his
                want of comprehension. All she could say was: “You are Mr. Razumov.” A slight frown
                passed over his forehead. After a short, watchful pause, he made a little bow of
                assent, and waited.</p>

            <p>At the thought that she had before her the man so highly regarded by her brother, the
                man who had known his value, spoken to him, understood him, had listened to his
                confidences, perhaps had encouraged him — her lips trembled, her eyes ran full of
                tears; she put out her hand, made a step towards him impulsively, saying with an
                effort to restrain her emotion, “Can’t you guess who I am?” He did not take the
                proffered hand. He even recoiled a pace, and Miss Haldin imagined that he was
                unpleasantly affected. Miss Haldin excused him, directing her displeasure at
                herself. She had behaved unworthily, like an emotional French girl. A manifestation
                of that kind could not be welcomed by a man of stern, self-contained character.</p>

            <p>He must have been stern indeed, or perhaps very timid with women, not to respond in a
                more human way to the advances of a girl like Nathalie Haldin — I thought to myself.
                Those lofty and solitary existences (I remembered the words suddenly) make a young
                man shy and an old man savage — often.</p>

            <p>“Well,” I encouraged Miss Haldin to proceed.</p>

            <p>She was still very dissatisfied with herself.</p>

            <p>“I went from bad to worse,” she said, with an air of discouragement very foreign to
                her. “I did everything foolish except actually bursting into tears. I am thankful to
                say I did not do that. But I was unable to speak for quite a long time.”</p>

            <p>She had stood before him, speechless, swallowing her sobs, and when she managed at
                last to utter something, it was only her brother’s name — “Victor — Victor Haldin!”
                she gasped out, and again her voice failed her.</p>

            <p>“Of course,” she commented to me, “this distressed him. He was quite overcome. I have
                told you my opinion that he is a man of deep feeling — it is impossible to doubt it.
                You should have seen his face. He positively reeled. He leaned against the wall of
                the terrace. Their friendship must have been the very brotherhood of souls! I was
                grateful to him for that emotion, which made me feel less ashamed of my own lack of
                self-control. Of course I had regained the power of speech at once, almost. All this
                lasted not more than a few seconds. ‘I am his sister,’ I said. ‘Maybe you have heard
                of me.’”</p>

            <p>“And had he?” I interrupted.</p>

            <p>“I don’t know. How could it have been otherwise? And yet. . . . But what does that
                matter? I stood there before him, near enough to be touched and surely not looking
                like an impostor. All I know is, that he put out both his hands then to me, I may
                say flung them out at me, with the greatest readiness and warmth, and that I seized
                and pressed them, feeling that I was finding again a little of what I thought was
                lost to me for ever, with the loss of my brother — some of that hope, inspiration,
                and support which I used to get from my dear dead . . . .”</p>

            <p>I understood quite well what she meant. We strolled on slowly. I refrained from
                looking at her. And it was as if answering my own thoughts that I murmured —</p>

            <p>“No doubt it was a great friendship — as you say. And that young man ended by
                welcoming your name, so to speak, with both hands. After that, of course, you would
                understand each other. Yes, you would understand each other quickly.”</p>

            <p>It was a moment before I heard her voice.</p>

            <p>“Mr. Razumov seems to be a man of few words. A reserved man — even when he is
                strongly moved.”</p>

            <p>Unable to forget — or even to forgive — the bass- toned expansiveness of Peter
                Ivanovitch, the Archpatron of revolutionary parties, I said that I took this for a
                favourable trait of character. It was associated with sincerity — in my mind.</p>

            <p>“And, besides, we had not much time,” she added.</p>

            <p>“No, you would not have, of course.” My suspicion and even dread of the feminist and
                his Egeria was so ineradicable that I could not help asking with real anxiety, which
                I made smiling —</p>

            <p>“But you escaped all right?”</p>

            <p>She understood me, and smiled too, at my uneasiness.</p>

            <p>“Oh yes! I escaped, if you like to call it that. I walked away quickly. There was no
                need to run. I am neither frightened nor yet fascinated, like that poor woman who
                received me so strangely.”</p>

            <p>“And Mr. — Mr. Razumov. . .?”</p>

            <p>“He remained there, of course. I suppose he went into the house after I left him. You
                remember that he came here strongly recommended to Peter Ivanovitch — possibly
                entrusted with important messages for him.”</p>

            <p>“Ah yes! From that priest who . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Father Zosim — yes. Or from others, perhaps.”</p>

            <p>“You left him, then. But have you seen him since, may I ask?”</p>

            <p>For some time Miss Haldin made no answer to this very direct question, then —</p>

            <p>“I have been expecting to see him here to-day,” she said quietly.</p>

            <p>“You have! Do you meet, then, in this garden? In that case I had better leave you at
                once.”</p>

            <p>“No, why leave me? And we don’t meet in this garden. I have not seen Mr. Razumov
                since that first time. Not once. But I have been expecting him . . . .”</p>

            <p>She paused. I wondered to myself why that young revolutionist should show so little
                alacrity.</p>

            <p>“Before we parted I told Mr. Razumov that I walked here for an hour every day at this
                time. I could not explain to him then why I did not ask him to come and see us at
                once. Mother must be prepared for such a visit. And then, you see, I do not know
                myself what Mr. Razumov has to tell us. He, too, must be told first how it is with
                poor mother. All these thoughts flashed through my mind at once. So I told him
                hurriedly that there was a reason why I could not ask him to see us at home, but
                that I was in the habit of walking here. . . . This is a public place, but there are
                never many people about at this hour. I thought it would do very well. And it is so
                near our apartments. I don’t like to be very far away from mother. Our servant knows
                where I am in case I should be wanted suddenly.”</p>

            <p>“Yes. It is very convenient from that point of view,” I agreed.</p>

            <p>In fact, I thought the Bastions a very convenient place, since the girl did not think
                it prudent as yet to introduce that young man to her mother. It was here, then, I
                thought, looking round at that plot of ground of deplorable banality, that their
                acquaintance will begin and go on in the exchange of generous indignations and of
                extreme sentiments, too poignant, perhaps, for a non-Russian mind to conceive. I saw
                these two, escaped out of four score of millions of human beings ground between the
                upper and nether millstone, walking under these trees, their young heads close
                together. Yes, an excellent place to stroll and talk in. It even occurred to me,
                while we turned once more away from the wide iron gates, that when tired they would
                have plenty of accommodation to rest themselves. There was a quantity of tables and
                chairs displayed between the restaurant chalet and the bandstand, a whole raft of
                painted deals spread out under the trees. In the very middle of it I observed a
                solitary Swiss couple, whose fate was made secure from the cradle to the grave by
                the perfected mechanism of democratic institutions in a republic that could almost
                be held in the palm of ones hand. The man, colourlessly uncouth, was drinking beer
                out of a glittering glass; the woman, rustic and placid, leaning back in the rough
                chair, gazed idly around.</p>

            <p>There is little logic to be expected on this earth, not only in the matter of
                thought, but also of sentiment. I was surprised to discover myself displeased with
                that unknown young man. A week had gone by since they met. Was he callous, or shy,
                or very stupid? I could not make it out.</p>

            <p>“Do you think,” I asked Miss Haldin, after we had gone some distance up the great
                alley, “that Mr Razumov understood your intention? ”</p>

            <p>“Understood what I meant?” she wondered. “He was greatly moved. That I know! In my
                own agitation I could see it. But I spoke distinctly. He heard me; he seemed,
                indeed, to hang on my words. . .”</p>

            <p>Unconsciously she had hastened her pace. Her utterance, too, became quicker.</p>

            <p>I waited a little before I observed thoughtfully-</p>



            <p>“And yet he allowed all these days to pass.”</p>

            <p>“How can we tell what work he may have to do here? He is not an idler travelling for
                his pleasure. His time may not be his own — nor yet his thoughts, perhaps.”</p>

            <p>She slowed her pace suddenly, and in a lowered voice added —</p>

            <p>“Or his very life”— then paused and stood still “For all I know, he may have had to
                leave Geneva the very day he saw me.”</p>

            <p>“Without telling you!” I exclaimed incredulously.</p>

            <p>“I did not give him time. I left him quite abruptly. I behaved emotionally to the
                end. I am sorry for it. Even if I had given him the opportunity he would have been
                justified in taking me for a person not to be trusted. An emotional, tearful girl is
                not a person to confide in. But even if he has left Geneva for a time, I am
                confident that we shall meet again.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! you are confident. . . . I dare say. But on what ground?”</p>

            <p>“Because I’ve told him that I was in great need of some one, a fellow-countryman, a
                fellow- believer, to whom I could give my confidence in a certain matter.”</p>

            <p>“I see. I don’t ask you what answer he made. I confess that this is good ground for
                your belief in Mr. Razumov’s appearance before long. But he has not turned up
                to-day?”</p>

            <p>“No,” she said quietly, “not to-day;” and we stood for a time in silence, like people
                that have nothing more to say to each other and let their thoughts run widely
                asunder before their bodies go off their different ways. Miss Haldin glanced at the
                watch on her wrist and made a brusque movement. She had already overstayed her time,
                it seemed.</p>

            <p>“I don’t like to be away from mother,” she murmured, shaking her head. “It is not
                that she is very ill now. But somehow when I am not with her I am more uneasy than
                ever.”</p>

            <p>Mrs. Haldin had not made the slightest allusion to her son for the last week or more.
                She sat, as usual, in the arm-chair by the window, looking out silently on that
                hopeless stretch of the Boulevard des Philosophes. When she spoke, a few lifeless
                words, it was of indifferent, trivial things.</p>

            <p>“For anyone who knows what the poor soul is thinking of, that sort of talk is more
                painful than her silence. But that is bad too; I can hardly endure it, and I dare
                not break it.</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin sighed, refastening a button of her glove which had come undone. I knew
                well enough what a hard time of it she must be having. The stress, its causes, its
                nature, would have undermined the health of an Occidental girl; but Russian natures
                have a singular power of resistance against the unfair strains of life. Straight and
                supple, with a short jacket open on her black dress, which made her figure appear
                more slender and her fresh but colourless face more pale, she compelled my wonder
                and admiration.</p>

            <p>“I can’t stay a moment longer. You ought to come soon to see mother. You know she
                calls you ‘<hi>L’ami.</hi>‘ It is an excellent name, and she really means it. And
                now <hi>au revoir</hi>; I must run.”</p>

            <p>She glanced vaguely down the broad walk — the hand she put out to me eluded my grasp
                by an unexpected upward movement, and rested upon my shoulder. Her red lips were
                slightly parted, not in a smile, however, but expressing a sort of startled
                pleasure. She gazed towards the gates and said quickly, with a gasp —</p>

            <p>“There! I knew it. Here he comes!”</p>

            <p>I understood that she must mean Mr. Razumov. A young man was walking up the alley,
                without haste. His clothes were some dull shade of brown, and he carried a stick.
                When my eyes first fell on him, his head was hanging on his breast as if in deep
                thought. While I was looking at him he raised it sharply, and at once stopped. I am
                certain he did, but that pause was nothing more perceptible than a faltering check
                in his gait, instantaneously overcome. Then he continued his approach, looking at us
                steadily. Miss Haldin signed to me to remain, and advanced a step or two to meet
                him.</p>

            <p>I turned my head away from that meeting, and did not look at them again till I heard
                Miss Haldin’s voice uttering his name in the way of introduction. Mr. Razumov was
                informed, in a warm, low tone, that, besides being a wonderful teacher, I was a
                great support “in our sorrow and distress.”</p>

            <p>Of course I was described also as an Englishman. Miss Haldin spoke rapidly, faster
                than I have ever heard her speak, and that by contrast made the quietness of her
                eyes more expressive.</p>

            <p>“I have given him my confidence,” she added, looking all the time at Mr. Razumov.
                That young man did, indeed, rest his gaze on Miss Haldin, but certainly did not look
                into her eyes which were so ready for him. Afterwards he glanced backwards and
                forwards at us both, while the faint commencement of a forced smile, followed by the
                suspicion of a frown, vanished one after another; I detected them, though neither
                could have been noticed by a person less intensely bent upon divining him than
                myself. I don’t know what Nathalie Haldin had observed, but my attention seized the
                very shades of these movements. The attempted smile was given up, the incipient
                frown was checked, and smoothed so that there should be no sign; but I imagined him
                exclaiming inwardly —</p>

            <p>“Her confidence! To this elderly person — this foreigner!”</p>

            <p>I imagined this because he looked foreign enough to me. I was upon the whole
                favourably impressed. He had an air of intelligence and even some distinction quite
                above the average of the students and other inhabitants of the <hi>Petite
                    Russie</hi>. His features were more decided than in the generality of Russian
                faces; he had a line of the jaw, a clean-shaven, sallow cheek; his nose was a ridge,
                and not a mere protuberance. He wore the hat well down over his eyes, his dark hair
                curled low on the nape of his neck; in the ill-fitting brown clothes there were
                sturdy limbs; a slight stoop brought out a satisfactory breadth of shoulders. Upon
                the whole I was not disappointed. Studious — robust — shy.</p>

            <p>Before Miss Haldin had ceased speaking I felt the grip of his hand on mine, a
                muscular, firm grip, but unexpectedly hot and dry. Not a word or even a mutter
                assisted this short and arid handshake.</p>

            <p>I intended to leave them to themselves, but Miss Haldin touched me lightly on the
                forearm with a significant contact, conveying a distinct wish. Let him smile who
                likes, but I was only too ready to stay near Nathalie Haldin, and I am not ashamed
                to say that it was no smiling matter to me. I stayed, not as a youth would have
                stayed, uplifted, as it were poised in the air, but soberly, with my feet on the
                ground and my mind trying to penetrate her intention. She had turned to Razumov.</p>

            <p>“Well. This is the place. Yes, it is here that I meant you to come. I have been
                walking every day. . . . Don’t excuse yourself — I understand. I am grateful to you
                for coming to-day, but all the same I cannot stay now. It is impossible. I must
                hurry off home. Yes, even with you standing before me, I must run off. I have been
                too long away. . . . You know how it is?”</p>

            <p>These last words were addressed to me. I noticed that Mr. Razumov passed the tip of
                his tongue over his lips just as a parched, feverish man might do. He took her hand
                in its black glove, which closed on his, and held it — detained it quite visibly to
                me against a drawing-back movement.</p>

            <p>“Thank you once more for — for understanding me,” she went on warmly. He interrupted
                her with a certain effect of roughness. I didn’t like him speaking to this frank
                creature so much from under the brim of his hat, as it were. And he produced a
                faint, rasping voice quite like a man with a parched throat.</p>

            <p>“What is there to thank me for? Understand you? . . . How did I understand you? . . .
                You had better know that I understand nothing. I was aware that you wanted to see me
                in this garden. I could not come before. I was hindered. And even to-day, you see
                . . . late.”</p>

            <p>She still held his hand.</p>

            <p>“I can, at any rate, thank you for not dismissing me from your mind as a weak,
                emotional girl. No doubt I want sustaining. I am very ignorant. But I can be
                trusted. Indeed I can!”</p>

            <p>“You are ignorant,” he repeated thoughtfully. He had raised his head, and was looking
                straight into her face now, while she held his hand. They stood like this for a long
                moment. She released his hand.</p>

            <p>“Yes. You did come late. It was good of you to come on the chance of me having
                loitered beyond my time. I was talking with this good friend here. I was talking of
                you. Yes, Kirylo Sidorovitch, of you. He was with me when I first heard of your
                being here in Geneva. He can tell you what comfort it was to my bewildered spirit to
                hear that news. He knew I meant to seek you out. It was the only object of my
                accepting the invitation of Peter Ivanovitch . . . .</p>

            <p>“Peter Ivanovitch talked to you of me,” he interrupted, in that wavering, hoarse
                voice which suggested a horribly dry throat.</p>

            <p>“Very little. Just told me your name, and that you had arrived here. Why should I
                have asked for more? What could he have told me that I did not know already from my
                brother’s letter? Three lines! And how much they meant to me! I will show them to
                you one day, Kirylo Sidorovitch. But now I must go. The first talk between us cannot
                be a matter of five minutes, so we had better not begin . . . .”</p>

            <p>I had been standing a little aside, seeing them both in profile. At that moment it
                occurred to me that Mr. Razumov’s face was older than his age.</p>

            <p>“If mother”— the girl had turned suddenly to me “were to wake up in my absence (so
                much longer than usual) she would perhaps question me. She seems to miss me more,
                you know, of late. She would want to know what delayed me — and, you see, it would
                be painful for me to dissemble before her.”</p>

            <p>I understood the point very well. For the same reason she checked what seemed to be
                on Mr. Razumov’s part a movement to accompany her.</p>

            <p>“No! No! I go alone, but meet me here as soon as possible.” Then to me in a lower,
                significant tone —</p>

            <p>“Mother may be sitting at the window at this moment, looking down the street. She
                must not know anything of Mr. Razumov’s presence here till — till something is
                arranged.” She paused before she added a little louder, but still speaking to me,
                “Mr. Razumov does not quite understand my difficulty, but you know what it is.”</p>

        <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="chapter">

            <head>5</head>


            <p>With a quick inclination of the head for us both, and an earnest, friendly glance at
                the young man, Miss Haldin left us covering our heads and looking after her
                straight, supple figure receding rapidly. Her walk was not that hybrid and uncertain
                gliding affected by some women, but a frank, strong, healthy movement forward.
                Rapidly she increased the distance — disappeared with suddenness at last. I
                discovered only then that Mr. Razumov, after ramming his hat well over his brow, was
                looking me over from head to foot. I dare say I was a very unexpected fact for that
                young Russian to stumble upon. I caught in his physiognomy, in his whole bearing, an
                expression compounded of curiosity and scorn, tempered by alarm — as though he had
                been holding his breath while I was not looking. But his eyes met mine with a gaze
                direct enough. I saw then for the first time that they were of a clear brown colour
                and fringed with thick black eyelashes. They were the youngest feature of his face.
                Not at all unpleasant eyes. He swayed slightly, leaning on his stick and generally
                hung in the wind. It flashed upon me that in leaving us together Miss Haldin had an
                intention — that something was entrusted to me, since, by a mere accident I had been
                found at hand. On this assumed ground I put all possible friendliness into my
                manner. I cast about for some right thing to say, and suddenly in Miss Haldin’s last
                words I perceived the clue to the nature of my mission.</p>

            <p>“No,” I said gravely, if with a smile, “you cannot be expected to understand.”</p>

            <p>His clean-shaven lip quivered ever so little before he said, as if wickedly
                amused —</p>

            <p>“But haven’t you heard just now? I was thanked by that young lady for understanding
                so well.”</p>

            <p>I looked at him rather hard. Was there a hidden and inexplicable sneer in this
                retort? No. It was not that. It might have been resentment. Yes. But what had he to
                resent? He looked as though he had not slept very well of late. I could almost feel
                on me the weight of his unrefreshed, motionless stare, the stare of a man who lies
                unwinking in the dark, angrily passive in the toils of disastrous thoughts. Now,
                when I know how true it was, I can honestly affirm that this was the effect he
                produced on me. It was painful in a curiously indefinite way — for, of course, the
                definition comes to me now while I sit writing in the fullness of my knowledge. But
                this is what the effect was at that time of absolute ignorance. This new sort of
                uneasiness which he seemed to be forcing upon me I attempted to put down by assuming
                a conversational, easy familiarity.</p>

            <p>“That extremely charming and essentially admirable young girl (I am — as you see —
                old enough to be frank in my expressions) was referring to her own feelings. Surely
                you must have understood that much?”</p>

            <p>He made such a brusque movement that he even tottered a little.</p>

            <p>“Must understand this! Not expected to understand that! I may have other things to
                do. And the girl is charming and admirable. Well — and if she is! I suppose I can
                see that for myself.”</p>

            <p>This sally would have been insulting if his voice had not been practically extinct,
                dried up in his throat; and the rustling effort of his speech too painful to give
                real offence.</p>

            <p>I remained silent, checked between the obvious fact and the subtle impression. It was
                open to me to leave him there and then; but the sense of having been entrusted with
                a mission, the suggestion of Miss Haldin’s last glance, was strong upon me. After a
                moment of reflection I said —</p>

            <p>“Shall we walk together a little?”</p>

            <p>He shrugged his shoulders so violently that he tottered again. I saw it out of the
                corner of my eye as I moved on, with him at my elbow. He had fallen back a little
                and was practically out of my sight, unless I turned my head to look at him. I did
                not wish to indispose him still further by an appearance of marked curiosity. It
                might have been distasteful to such a young and secret refugee from under the
                pestilential shadow hiding the true, kindly face of his land. And the shadow, the
                attendant of his countrymen, stretching across the middle of Europe, was lying on
                him too, darkening his figure to my mental vision. “Without doubt,” I said to
                myself, “he seems a sombre, even a desperate revolutionist; but he is young, he may
                be unselfish and humane, capable of compassion, of . . . .”</p>

            <p>I heard him clear gratingly his parched throat, and became all attention.</p>

            <p>“This is beyond everything,” were his first words. “It is beyond everything! I find
                you here, for no reason that I can understand, in possession of something I cannot
                be expected to understand! A confidant! A foreigner! Talking about an admirable
                Russian girl. Is the admirable girl a fool, I begin to wonder? What are you at? What
                is your object?”</p>

            <p>He was barely audible, as if his throat had no more resonance than a dry rag, a piece
                of tinder. It was so pitiful that I found it extremely easy to control my
                indignation.</p>

            <p>“When you have lived a little longer, Mr. Razumov, you will discover that no woman is
                an absolute fool. I am not a feminist, like that illustrious author, Peter
                Ivanovitch, who, to say the truth, is not a little suspect to me . . . .”</p>

            <p>He interrupted me, in a surprising note of whispering astonishment.</p>

            <p>“Suspect to you! Peter Ivanovitch suspect to you! To you! . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes, in a certain aspect he is,” I said, dismissing my remark lightly. “As I was
                saying, Mr. Razumov, when you have lived long enough, you will learn to discriminate
                between the noble trustfulness of a nature foreign to every meanness and the
                flattered credulity of some women; though even the credulous, silly as they may be,
                unhappy as they are sure to be, are never absolute fools. It is my belief that no
                woman is ever completely deceived. Those that are lost leap into the abyss with
                their eyes open, if all the truth were known.”</p>

            <p>“Upon my word,” he cried at my elbow, “what is it to me whether women are fools or
                lunatics? I really don’t care what you think of them. I— I am not interested in
                them. I let them be. I am not a young man in a novel. How do you know that I want to
                learn anything about women? . . . What is the meaning of all this?”</p>

            <p>“The object, you mean, of this conversation, which I admit I have forced upon you in
                a measure.”</p>

            <p>“Forced! Object!” he repeated, still keeping half a pace or so behind me. “You wanted
                to talk about women, apparently. That’s a subject. But I don’t care for it. I have
                never. . . . In fact, I have had other subjects to think about.”</p>

            <p>“I am concerned here with one woman only — a young girl — the sister of your dead
                friend — Miss Haldin. Surely you can think a little of her. What I meant from the
                first was that there is a situation which you cannot be expected to understand.”</p>

            <p>I listened to his unsteady footfalls by my side for the space of several strides.</p>

            <p>“I think that it may prepare the ground for your next interview with Miss Haldin if I
                tell you of it. I imagine that she might have had something of the kind in her mind
                when she left us together. I believe myself authorized to speak. The peculiar
                situation I have alluded to has arisen in the first grief and distress of Victor
                Haldin’s execution. There was something peculiar in the circumstances of his arrest.
                You no doubt know the whole truth . . . .”</p>

            <p>I felt my arm seized above the elbow, and next instant found myself swung so as to
                face Mr. Razumov.</p>

            <p>“You spring up from the ground before me with this talk. Who the devil are you? This
                is not to be borne! Why! What for? What do you know what is or is not peculiar? What
                have you to do with any confounded circumstances, or with anything that happens in
                Russia, anyway?”</p>

            <p>He leaned on his stick with his other hand, heavily; and when he let go my arm, I was
                certain in my mind that he was hardly able to keep on his feet.</p>

            <p>“Let us sit down at one of these vacant tables,” I proposed, disregarding this
                display of unexpectedly profound emotion. It was not without its effect on me, I
                confess. I was sorry for him.</p>

            <p>“What tables? What are you talking about? Oh — the empty tables? The tables there.
                Certainly. I will sit at one of the empty tables.”</p>

            <p>I led him away from the path to the very centre of the raft of deals before the
                    <hi>chalet</hi>. The Swiss couple were gone by that time. We were alone on the
                raft, so to speak. Mr. Razumov dropped into a chair, let fall his stick, and propped
                on his elbows, his head between his hands, stared at me persistently, openly, and
                continuously, while I signalled the waiter and ordered some beer. I could not
                quarrel with this silent inspection very well, because, truth to tell, I felt
                somewhat guilty of having been sprung on him with some abruptness — of having
                “sprung from the ground,” as he expressed it.</p>

            <p>While waiting to be served I mentioned that, born from parents settled in St.
                Petersburg, I had acquired the language as a child. The town I did not remember,
                having left it for good as a boy of nine, but in later years I had renewed my
                acquaintance with the language. He listened, without as much as moving his eyes the
                least little bit. He had to change his position when the beer came, and the instant
                draining of his glass revived him. He leaned back in his chair and, folding his arms
                across his chest, continued to stare at me squarely. It occurred to me that his
                clean-shaven, almost swarthy face was really of the very mobile sort, and that the
                absolute stillness of it was the acquired habit of a revolutionist, of a,
                conspirator everlastingly on his guard against self-betrayal in a world of secret
                spies.</p>

            <p>“But you are an Englishman — a teacher of English literature,” he murmured, in a
                voice that was no longer issuing from a parched throat. “I have heard of you. People
                told me you have lived here for years.”</p>

            <p>“Quite true. More than twenty years. And I have been assisting Miss Haldin with her
                English studies.”</p>

            <p>“You have been reading English poetry with her,” he said, immovable now, like another
                man altogether, a complete stranger to the man of the heavy and uncertain footfalls
                a little while ago — at my elbow.</p>

            <p>“Yes, English poetry,” I said. “ But the trouble of which I speak was caused by an
                English newspaper.”</p>

            <p>He continued to stare at me. I don’t think he was aware that the story of the
                midnight arrest had been ferreted out by an English journalist and given to the
                world. When I explained this to him he muttered contemptuously, “It may have been
                altogether a lie.”</p>

            <p>“I should think you are the best judge of that,” I retorted, a little disconcerted.
                “I must confess that to me it looks to be true in the main.”</p>

            <p>“How can you tell truth from lies?” he queried in his new, immovable manner.</p>

            <p>“I don’t know how you do it in Russia,” I began, rather nettled by his attitude. He
                interrupted me.</p>

            <p>“In Russia, and in general everywhere — in a newspaper, for instance. The colour of
                the ink and the shapes of the letters are the same.”</p>

            <p>“Well, there are other trifles one can go by. The character of the publication, the
                general verisimilitude of the news, the consideration of the motive, and so on. I
                don’t trust blindly the accuracy of special correspondents — but why should this one
                have gone to the trouble of concocting a circumstantial falsehood on a matter of no
                importance to the world?”</p>

            <p>“That’s what it is,” he grumbled. “What’s going on with us is of no importance — a
                mere sensational story to amuse the readers of the papers — the superior
                contemptuous Europe. It is hateful to think of. But let them wait a bit!”</p>

            <p>He broke off on this sort of threat addressed to the western world. Disregarding the
                anger in his stare, I pointed out that whether the journalist was well — or
                ill-informed, the concern of the friends of these ladies was with the effect the few
                lines of print in question had produced — the effect alone. And surely he must be
                counted as one of the friends — if only for the sake of his late comrade and
                intimate fellow-revolutionist. At that point I thought he was going to speak
                vehemently; but he only astounded me by the convulsive start of his whole body. He
                restrained himself, folded his loosened arms tighter across his chest, and sat back
                with a smile in which there was a twitch of scorn and malice.</p>

            <p>“Yes, a comrade and an intimate. . . . Very well,” he said.</p>

            <p>“I ventured to speak to you on that assumption. And I cannot be mistaken. I was
                present when Peter Ivanovitch announced your arrival here to Miss Haldin, and I saw
                her relief and thankfulness when your name was mentioned. Afterwards she showed me
                her brother’s letter, and read out the few words in which he alludes to you. What
                else but a friend could you have been?”</p>

            <p>“Obviously. That’s perfectly well known. A friend. Quite correct. . . . Go on. You
                were talking of some effect.”</p>

            <p>I said to myself: “He puts on the callousness of a stern revolutionist, the
                insensibility to common emotions of a man devoted to a destructive idea. He is
                young, and his sincerity assumes a pose before a stranger, a foreigner, an old man.
                Youth must assert itself. . . . As concisely as possible I exposed to him the state
                of mind poor Mrs. Haldin had been thrown into by the news of her son’s untimely
                end.</p>

            <p>He listened — I felt it — with profound attention. His level stare deflected
                gradually downwards, left my face, and rested at last on the ground at his feet.</p>

            <p>“You can enter into the sister’s feelings. As you said, I have only read a little
                English poetry with her, and I won’t make myself ridiculous in your eyes by trying
                to speak of her. But you have seen her. She is one of these rare human beings that
                do not want explaining. At least I think so. They had only that son, that brother,
                for a link with the wider world, with the future. The very groundwork of active
                existence for Nathalie Haldin is gone with him. Can you wonder then that she turns
                with eagerness to the only man her brother mentions in his letters. Your name is a
                sort of legacy.”</p>

            <p>“What could he have written of me?” he cried, in a low, exasperated tone.</p>

            <p>“Only a few words. It is not for me to repeat them to you, Mr. Razumov; but you may
                believe my assertion that these words are forcible enough to make both his mother
                and his sister believe implicitly in the worth of your judgment and in the truth of
                anything you may have to say to them. It’s impossible for you now to pass them by
                like strangers.”</p>

            <p>I paused, and for a moment sat listening to the footsteps of the few people passing
                up and down the broad central walk. While I was speaking his head had sunk upon his
                breast above his folded arms. He raised it sharply.</p>

            <p>“Must I go then and lie to that old woman!”</p>

            <p>It was not anger; it was something else, something more poignant, and not so simple.
                I was aware of it sympathetically, while I was profoundly concerned at the nature of
                that exclamation.</p>

            <p>“Dear me! Won’t the truth do, then? I hoped you could have told them something
                consoling. I am thinking of the poor mother now. Your Russia <hi>is</hi> a cruel
                country.”</p>

            <p>He moved a little in his chair.</p>

            <p>“Yes,” I repeated. “I thought you would have had something authentic to tell.”</p>

            <p>The twitching of his lips before he spoke was curious.</p>

            <p>“What if it is not worth telling?”</p>

            <p>“Not worth — from what point of view? I don’t understand.”</p>

            <p>“From every point of view.”</p>

            <p>I spoke with some asperity.</p>

            <p>“I should think that anything which could explain the circumstances of that midnight
                arrest . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Reported by a journalist for the amusement of the civilized Europe,” he broke in
                scornfully.</p>

            <p>“Yes, reported. . . . But aren’t they true? I can’t make out your attitude in this?
                Either the man is a hero to you, or . . . .”</p>

            <p>He approached his face with fiercely distended nostrils close to mine so suddenly
                that I had the greatest difficulty in not starting back.</p>

            <p>“You ask me! I suppose it amuses you, all this. Look here! I am a worker. I studied.
                Yes, I studied very hard. There is intelligence here.” (He tapped his forehead with
                his finger-tips.) “Don’t you think a Russian may have sane ambitions? Yes — I had
                even prospects. Certainly! I had. And now you see me here, abroad, everything gone,
                lost, sacrificed. You see me here — and you ask! You see me, don’t you? — sitting
                before you.”</p>

            <p>He threw himself back violently. I kept outwardly calm.</p>

            <p>“Yes, I see you here; and I assume you are here on account of the Haldin affair?”</p>

            <p>His manner changed.</p>

            <p>“You call it the Haldin affair — do you?” he observed indifferently.</p>

            <p>“I have no right to ask you anything,” I said. “I wouldn’t presume. But in that case
                the mother and the sister of him who must be a hero in your eyes cannot be
                indifferent to you. The girl is a frank and generous creature, having the noblest —
                well — illusions. You will tell her nothing — or you will tell her everything. But
                speaking now of the object with which I’ve approached you first, we have to deal
                with the morbid state of the mother. Perhaps something could be invented under your
                authority as a cure for a distracted and suffering soul filled with maternal
                affection.”</p>

            <p>His air of weary indifference was accentuated, I could not help thinking,
                wilfully.</p>

            <p>“Oh yes. Something might,” he mumbled carelessly.</p>

            <p>He put his hand over his mouth to conceal a yawn. When he uncovered his lips they
                were smiling faintly.</p>

            <p>“Pardon me. This has been a long conversation, and I have not had much sleep the last
                two nights.”</p>

            <p>This unexpected, somewhat insolent sort of apology had the merit of being perfectly
                true. He had had no nightly rest to speak of since that day when, in the grounds of
                the Chateau Borel, the sister of Victor Haldin had appeared before him. The
                perplexities and the complex terrors — I may say — of this sleeplessness are
                recorded in the document I was to see later — the document which is the main source
                of this narrative. At the moment he looked to me convincingly tired, gone slack all
                over, like a man who has passed through some sort of crisis.</p>

            <p>“I have had a lot of urgent writing to do,” he added.</p>

            <p>I rose from my chair at once, and he followed my example, without haste, a little
                heavily.</p>

            <p>“I must apologize for detaining you so long,” I said.</p>

            <p>“Why apologize? One can’t very well go to bed before night. And you did not detain
                me. I could have left you at any time.”</p>

            <p>I had not stayed with him to be offended.</p>

            <p>“I am glad you have been sufficiently interested,” I said calmly. “No merit of mine,
                though — the commonest sort of regard for the mother of your friend was enough.
                . . . As to Miss Haldin herself, she at one time was disposed to think that her
                brother had been betrayed to the police in some way.”</p>

            <p>To my great surprise Mr. Razumov sat down again suddenly. I stared at him, and I must
                say that he returned my stare without winking for quite a considerable time.</p>

            <p>“In some way,” he mumbled, as if he had not understood or could not believe his
                ears.</p>

            <p>“Some unforeseen event, a sheer accident might have done that,” I went on. “Or, as
                she characteristically put it to me, the folly or weakness of some unhappy
                fellow-revolutionist.”</p>

            <p>“Folly or weakness,” he repeated bitterly.</p>

            <p>“She is a very generous creature,” I observed after a time. The man admired by Victor
                Haldin fixed his eyes on the ground. I turned away and moved off, apparently
                unnoticed by him. I nourished no resentment of the moody brusqueness with which he
                had treated me. The sentiment I was carrying away from that conversation was that of
                hopelessness. Before I had got fairly clear of the raft of chairs and tables he had
                rejoined me.</p>

            <p>“H’m, yes!” I heard him at my elbow again. “But what do you think?”</p>

            <p>I did not look round even.</p>

            <p>“I think that you people are under a curse.”</p>

            <p>He made no sound. It was only on the pavement outside the gate that I heard him
                again.</p>

            <p>“I should like to walk with you a little.”</p>

            <p>After all, I preferred this enigmatical young man to his celebrated compatriot, the
                great Peter Ivanovitch. But I saw no reason for being particularly gracious.</p>

            <p>“I am going now to the railway station, by the shortest way from here, to meet a
                friend from England,” I said, for all answer to his unexpected proposal. I hoped
                that something informing could come of it. As we stood on the curbstone waiting for
                a tramcar to pass, he remarked gloomily —</p>

            <p>“I like what you said just now.”</p>

            <p>“Do you?”</p>

            <p>We stepped off the pavement together.</p>

            <p>“The great problem,” he went on, “is to understand thoroughly the nature of the
                curse.”</p>

            <p>“That’s not very difficult, I think.”</p>

            <p>“I think so too,” he agreed with me, and his readiness, strangely enough, did not
                make him less enigmatical in the least.</p>

            <p>“A curse is an evil spell,” I tried him again. “And the important, the great problem,
                is to find the means to break it.”</p>

            <p>“Yes. To find the means.”</p>

            <p>That was also an assent, but he seemed to be thinking of something else. We had
                crossed diagonally the open space before the theatre, and began to descend a broad,
                sparely frequented street in the direction of one of the smaller bridges. He kept on
                by my side without speaking for a long time.</p>

            <p>“You are not thinking of leaving Geneva soon?” I asked.</p>

            <p>He was silent for so long that I began to think I had been indiscreet, and should get
                no answer at all. Yet on looking at him I almost believed that my question had
                caused him something in the nature of positive anguish. I detected it mainly in the
                clasping of his hands, in which he put a great force stealthily. Once, however, he
                had overcome that sort of agonizing hesitation sufficiently to tell me that he had
                no such intention, he became rather communicative — at least relatively to the
                former off-hand curtness of his speeches. The tone, too, was more amiable. He
                informed me that he intended to study and also to write. He went even so far as to
                tell me he had been to Stuttgart. Stuttgart, I was aware, was one of the
                revolutionary centres. The directing committee of one of the Russian parties (I
                can’t tell now which) was located in that town. It was there that he got into touch
                with the active work of the revolutionists outside Russia.</p>

            <p>“I have never been abroad before,” he explained, in a rather inanimate voice now.
                Then, after a slight hesitation, altogether different from the agonizing
                irresolution my first simple question “whether he meant to stay in Geneva” had
                aroused, he made me an unexpected confidence —</p>

            <p>“The fact is, I have received a sort of mission from them.”</p>

            <p>“Which will keep you here in Geneva?”</p>

            <p>“Yes. Here. In this odious . . . .”</p>

            <p>I was satisfied with my faculty for putting two and two together when I drew the
                inference that the mission had something to do with the person of the great Peter
                Ivanovitch. But I kept that surmise to myself naturally, and Mr. Razumov said
                nothing more for some considerable time. It was only when we were nearly on the
                bridge we had been making for that he opened his lips again, abruptly —</p>

            <p>“Could I see that precious article anywhere?”</p>

            <p>I had to think for a moment before I saw what he was referring to.</p>

            <p>“It has been reproduced in parts by the Press here. There are files to be seen in
                various places. My copy of the English newspaper I have left with Miss Haldin, I
                remember, on the day after it reached me. I was sufficiently worried by seeing it
                lying on a table by the side of the poor mother’s chair for weeks. Then it
                disappeared. It was a relief, I assure you.”</p>

            <p>He had stopped short.</p>

            <p>“I trust,” I continued, “that you will find time to see these ladies fairly often —
                that you will make time.”</p>

            <p>He stared at me so queerly that I hardly know how to define his aspect. I could not
                understand it in this connexion at all. What ailed him? I asked myself. What strange
                thought had come into his head? What vision of all the horrors that can be seen in
                his hopeless country had come suddenly to haunt his brain? If it were anything
                connected with the fate of Victor Haldin, then I hoped earnestly he would keep it to
                himself for ever. I was, to speak plainly, so shocked that I tried to conceal my
                impression by — Heaven forgive me — a smile and the assumption of a light
                manner.</p>

            <p>“Surely,” I exclaimed, “that needn’t cost you a great effort.”</p>

            <p>He turned away from me and leaned over the parapet of the bridge. For a moment I
                waited, looking at his back. And yet, I assure you, I was not anxious just then to
                look at his face again. He did not move at all. He did not mean to move. I walked on
                slowly on my way towards the station, and at the end of the bridge I glanced over my
                shoulder. No, he had not moved. He hung well over the parapet, as if captivated by
                the smooth rush of the blue water under the arch. The current there is swift,
                extremely swift; it makes some people dizzy; I myself can never look at it for any
                length of time without experiencing a dread of being suddenly snatched away by its
                destructive force. Some brains cannot resist the suggestion of irresistible power
                and of headlong motion.</p>

            <p>It apparently had a charm for Mr. Razumov. I left him hanging far over the parapet of
                the bridge. The way he had behaved to me could not be put down to mere boorishness.
                There was something else under his scorn and impatience. Perhaps, I thought, with
                sudden approach to hidden truth, it was the same thing which had kept him over a
                week, nearly ten days indeed, from coming near Miss Haldin. But what it was I could
                not tell.</p>

            <p>The water under the bridge ran violent and deep. Its slightly undulating rush seemed
                capable of scouring out a channel for itself through solid granite while you looked.
                But had it flowed through Razumov’s breast, it could not have washed away the
                accumulated bitterness the wrecking of his life had deposited there.</p>

            <p>“What is the meaning of all this?” he thought, staring downwards at the headlong flow
                so smooth and clean that only the passage of a faint air- bubble, or a thin
                vanishing streak of foam like a white hair, disclosed its vertiginous rapidity, its
                terrible force. “Why has that meddlesome old Englishman blundered against me? And
                what is this silly tale of a crazy old woman?”</p>

            <p>He was trying to think brutally on purpose, but he avoided any mental reference to
                the young girl. “A crazy old woman,” he repeated to himself.” It is a fatality! Or
                ought I to despise all this as absurd? But no! I am wrong! I can’t afford to despise
                anything. An absurdity may be the starting-point of the most dangerous
                complications. How is one to guard against it? It puts to rout one’s intelligence.
                The more intelligent one is the less one suspects an absurdity.”</p>

            <p>A wave of wrath choked his thoughts for a moment. It even made his body leaning over
                the parapet quiver; then he resumed his silent thinking, like a secret dialogue with
                himself. And even in that privacy, his thought had some reservations of which he was
                vaguely conscious.</p>

            <p>“After all, this is not absurd. It is insignificant. It is absolutely insignificant —
                absolutely. The craze of an old woman — the fussy officiousness of a blundering
                elderly Englishman. What devil put him in the way? Haven’t I treated him cavalierly
                enough? Haven’t I just? That’s the way to treat these meddlesome persons. Is it
                possible that he still stands behind my back, waiting?”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt a faint chill run down his spine. It was not fear. He was certain that
                it was not fear — not fear for himself — but it was, all the same, a sort of
                apprehension as if for another, for some one he knew without being able to put a
                name on the personality. But the recollection that the officious Englishman had a
                train to meet tranquillized him for a time. It was too stupid to suppose that he
                should be wasting his time in waiting. It was unnecessary to look round and make
                sure.</p>

            <p>But what did the man mean by his extraordinary rigmarole about the newspaper, and
                that crazy old woman? he thought suddenly. It was a damnable presumption, anyhow,
                something that only an Englishman could be capable of. All this was a sort of sport
                for him — the sport of revolution — a game to look at from the height of his
                superiority. And what on earth did he mean by his exclamation, “Won’t the truth
                do?”</p>

            <p>Razumov pressed his folded arms to the stone coping over which he was leaning with
                force. “Won’t the truth do? The truth for the crazy old mother of the —”</p>

            <p>The young man shuddered again. Yes. The truth would do! Apparently it would do.
                Exactly. And receive thanks, he thought, formulating the unspoken words cynically.
                “Fall on my neck in gratitude, no doubt,” he jeered mentally. But this mood
                abandoned him at once. He felt sad, as if his heart had become empty suddenly.
                “Well, I must be cautious,” he concluded, coming to himself as though his brain had
                been awakened from a trance. “There is nothing, no one, too insignificant, too
                absurd to be disregarded,” he thought wearily. “I must be cautious.”</p>

            <p>Razumov pushed himself with his hand away from the balustrade and, retracing his
                steps along the bridge, walked straight to his lodgings, where, for a few days, he
                led a solitary and retired existence. He neglected Peter Ivanovitch, to whom he was
                accredited by the Stuttgart group; he never went near the refugee revolutionists, to
                whom he had been introduced on his arrival. He kept out of that world altogether.
                And he felt that such conduct, causing surprise and arousing suspicion, contained an
                element of danger for himself.</p>

            <p>This is not to say that during these few days he never went out. I met him several
                times in the streets, but he gave me no recognition. Once, going home after an
                evening call on the ladies Haldin, I saw him crossing the dark roadway of the
                Boulevard des Philosophes. He had a broad- brimmed soft hat, and the collar of his
                coat turned up. I watched him make straight for the house, but, instead of going in,
                he stopped opposite the still lighted windows, and after a time went away down a
                side-street.</p>

            <p>I knew that he had not been to see Mrs. Haldin yet. Miss Haldin told me he was
                reluctant; moreover, the mental condition of Mrs. Haldin had changed. She seemed to
                think now that her son was living, and she perhaps awaited his arrival. Her
                immobility in the great arm-chair in front of the window had an air of expectancy,
                even when the blind was down and the lamps lighted.</p>

            <p>For my part, I was convinced that she had received her death-stroke; Miss Haldin, to
                whom, of course, I said nothing of my forebodings, thought that no good would come
                from introducing Mr. Razumov just then, an opinion which I shared fully. I knew that
                she met the young man on the Bastions. Once or twice I saw them strolling slowly up
                the main alley. They met every day for weeks. I avoided passing that way during the
                hour when Miss Haldin took her exercise there. One day, however, in a fit of absent-
                mindedness, I entered the gates and came upon her walking alone. I stopped to
                exchange a few words. Mr. Razumov failed to turn up, and we began to talk about him
                — naturally.</p>

            <p>“Did he tell you anything definite about your brother’s activities — his end?” I
                ventured to ask.</p>

            <p>“No,” admitted Miss Haldin, with some hesitation. “Nothing definite.”</p>

            <p>I understood well enough that all their conversations must have been referred
                mentally to that dead man who had brought them together. That was unavoidable. But
                it was in the living man that she was interested. That was unavoidable too, I
                suppose. And as I pushed my inquiries I discovered that he had disclosed himself to
                her as a by no means conventional revolutionist, contemptuous of catchwords, of
                theories, of men too. I was rather pleased at that — but I was a little puzzled.</p>

            <p>“His mind goes forward, far ahead of the struggle,” Miss Haldin explained. “Of
                course, he is an actual worker too,” she added.</p>

            <p>“And do you understand him?” I inquired point- blank.</p>

            <p>She hesitated again. “Not altogether,” she murmured.</p>

            <p>I perceived that he had fascinated her by an assumption of mysterious reserve.</p>

            <p>“Do you know what I think?” she went on, breaking through her reserved, almost
                reluctant attitude: “I think that he is observing, studying me, to discover whether
                I am worthy of his trust . . . .”</p>

            <p>“And that pleases you?”</p>

            <p>She kept mysteriously silent for a moment. Then with energy, but in a confidential
                tone —</p>

            <p>“I am convinced;” she declared, “that this extraordinary man is meditating some vast
                plan, some great undertaking; he is possessed by it — he suffers from it — and from
                being alone in the world.”</p>

            <p>“And so he’s looking for helpers?” I commented, turning away my head.</p>

            <p>Again there was a silence.</p>

            <p>“Why not?” she said at last.</p>

            <p>The dead brother, the dying mother, the foreign friend, had fallen into a distant
                background. But, at the same time, Peter Ivanovitch was absolutely nowhere now. And
                this thought consoled me. Yet I saw the gigantic shadow of Russian life deepening
                around her like the darkness of an advancing night. It would devour her presently. I
                inquired after Mrs. Haldin — that other victim of the deadly shade.</p>

            <p>A remorseful uneasiness appeared in her frank eyes. Mother seemed no worse, but if I
                only knew what strange fancies she had sometimes! Then Miss Haldin, glancing at her
                watch, declared that she could not stay a moment longer, and with a hasty hand-shake
                ran off lightly.</p>

            <p>Decidedly, Mr. Razumov was not to turn up that day. Incomprehensible youth!</p>

            <p>But less than an hour afterwards, while crossing the Place Mollard, I caught sight of
                him boarding a South Shore tramcar.</p>

            <p>“He’s going to the Chateau Borel,” I thought.</p>

            <p>After depositing Razumov at the gates of the Chateau Borel, some half a mile or so
                from the town, the car continued its journey between two straight lines of shady
                trees. Across the roadway in the sunshine a short wooden pier jutted into the
                shallow pale water, which farther out had an intense blue tint contrasting
                unpleasantly with the green orderly slopes on the opposite shore. The whole view,
                with the harbour jetties of white stone underlining lividly the dark front of the
                town to the left, and the expanding space of water to the right with jutting
                promontories of no particular character, had the uninspiring, glittering quality of
                a very fresh oleograph. Razumov turned his back on it with contempt. He thought it
                odious — oppressively odious — in its unsuggestive finish: the very perfection of
                mediocrity attained at last after centuries of toil and culture. And turning his
                back on it, he faced the entrance to the grounds of the Chateau Borel.</p>

            <p>The bars of the central way and the wrought-iron arch between the dark
                weather-stained stone piers were very rusty; and, though fresh tracks of wheels ran
                under it, the gate looked as if it had not been opened for a very long time. But
                close against the lodge, built of the same grey stone as the piers (its windows were
                all boarded up), there was a small side entrance. The bars of that were rusty too;
                it stood ajar and looked as though it had not been closed for a long time. In fact,
                Razumov, trying to push it open a little wider, discovered it was immovable.</p>

            <p>“Democratic virtue. There are no thieves here, apparently,” he muttered to himself,
                with displeasure. Before advancing into the grounds he looked back sourly at an idle
                working man lounging on a bench in the clean, broad avenue. The fellow had thrown
                his feet up; one of his arms hung over the low back of the public seat; he was
                taking a day off in lordly repose, as if everything in sight belonged to him.</p>

            <p>“Elector! Eligible! Enlightened!” Razumov muttered to himself. “A brute, all the
                same.”</p>

            <p>Razumov entered the grounds and walked fast up the wide sweep of the drive, trying to
                think of nothing — to rest his head, to rest his emotions too. But arriving at the
                foot of the terrace before the house he faltered, affected physically by some
                invisible interference. The mysteriousness of his quickened heart-beats startled
                him. He stopped short and looked at the brick wall of the terrace, faced with
                shallow arches, meagrely clothed by a few unthriving creepers, with an ill-kept
                narrow flower-bed along its foot.</p>

            <p>“It is here!” he thought, with a sort of awe. “It is here — on this very spot . . .
                .”</p>

            <p>He was tempted to flight at the mere recollection of his first meeting with Nathalie
                Haldin. He confessed it to himself; but he did not move, and that not because he
                wished to resist an unworthy weakness, but because he knew that he had no place to
                fly to. Moreover, he could not leave Geneva. He recognized, even without thinking,
                that it was impossible. It would have been a fatal admission, an act of moral
                suicide. It would have been also physically dangerous. Slowly he ascended the stairs
                of the terrace, flanked by two stained greenish stone urns of funereal aspect.</p>

            <p>Across the broad platform, where a few blades of grass sprouted on the discoloured
                gravel, the door of the house, with its ground-floor windows shuttered, faced him,
                wide open. He believed that his approach had been noted, because, framed in the
                doorway, without his tall hat, Peter Ivanovitch seemed to be waiting for his
                approach.</p>

            <p>The ceremonious black frock-coat and the bared head of Europe’s greatest feminist
                accentuated the dubiousness of his status in the house rented by Madame de S— — his
                Egeria. His aspect combined the formality of the caller with the freedom of the
                proprietor. Florid and bearded and masked by the dark blue glasses, he met the
                visitor, and at once took him familiarly under the arm.</p>

            <p>Razumov suppressed every sign of repugnance by an effort which the constant necessity
                of prudence had rendered almost mechanical. And this necessity had settled his
                expression in a cast of austere, almost fanatical, aloofness. The “heroic fugitive,”
                impressed afresh by the severe detachment of this new arrival from revolutionary
                Russia, took a conciliatory, even a confidential tone. Madame de S—— was resting
                after a bad night. She often had bad nights. He had left his hat upstairs on the
                landing and had come down to suggest to his young friend a stroll and a good
                open-hearted talk in one of the shady alleys behind the house. After voicing this
                proposal, the great man glanced at the unmoved face by his side, and could not
                restrain himself from exclaiming —</p>

            <p>“On my word, young man, you are an extraordinary person.”</p>

            <p>“I fancy you are mistaken, Peter Ivanovitch. If I were really an extraordinary
                person, I would not be here, walking with you in a garden in Switzerland, Canton of
                Geneva, Commune of — what’s the name of the Commune this place belongs to? . . .
                Never mind — the heart of democracy, anyhow. A fit heart for it; no bigger than a
                parched pea and about as much value. I am no more extraordinary than the rest of us
                Russians, wandering abroad.”</p>

            <p>But Peter Ivanovitch dissented emphatically —</p>

            <p>“No! No! You are not ordinary. I have some experience of Russians who are — well —
                living abroad. You appear to me, and to others too, a marked personality,”</p>

            <p>“What does he mean by this?” Razumov asked himself, turning his eyes fully on his
                companion. The face of Peter Ivanovitch expressed a meditative seriousness.</p>

            <p>“You don’t suppose, Kirylo Sidorovitch, that I have not heard of you from various
                points where you made yourself known on your way here? I have had letters.”</p>

            <p>“Oh, we are great in talking about each other,” interjected Razumov, who had listened
                with great attention. “Gossip, tales, suspicions, and all that sort of thing, we
                know how to deal in to perfection. Calumny, even.”</p>

            <p>In indulging in this sally, Razumov managed very well to conceal the feeling of
                anxiety which had come over him. At the same time he was saying to himself that
                there could be no earthly reason for anxiety. He was relieved by the evident
                sincerity of the protesting voice.</p>

            <p>“Heavens!” cried Peter Ivanovitch. “What are you talking about? What reason can
                    <hi>you</hi> have to. . .?</p>

            <p>The great exile flung up his arms as if words had failed him in sober truth. Razumov
                was satisfied. Yet he was moved to continue in the same vein.</p>

            <p>“I am talking of the poisonous plants which flourish in the world of conspirators,
                like evil mushrooms in a dark cellar.”</p>

            <p>“You are casting aspersions,” remonstrated Peter Ivanovitch, “which as far as you are
                concerned —”</p>

            <p>“No!” Razumov interrupted without heat. “Indeed, I don’t want to cast aspersions, but
                it’s just as well to have no illusions.”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch gave him an inscrutable glance of his dark spectacles, accompanied
                by a faint smile.</p>

            <p>“The man who says that he has no illusions has at least that one,” he said, in a very
                friendly tone. “But I see how it is, Kirylo Sidorovitch. You aim at stoicism.”</p>

            <p>“Stoicism! That’s a pose of the Greeks and the Romans. Let’s leave it to them. We are
                Russians, that is — children; that is — sincere; that is — cynical, if you like. But
                that’s not a pose.”</p>

            <p>A long silence ensued. They strolled slowly under the lime-trees. Peter Ivanovitch
                had put his hands behind his back. Razumov felt the ungravelled ground of the deeply
                shaded walk damp and as if slippery under his feet. He asked himself, with
                uneasiness, if he were saying the right things. The direction of the conversation
                ought to have been more under his control, he reflected. The great man appeared to
                be reflecting on his side too. He cleared his throat slightly, and Razumov felt at
                once a painful reawakening of scorn and fear.</p>

            <p>“I am astonished,” began Peter Ivanovitch gently. “Supposing you are right in your
                indictment, how can you raise any question of calumny or gossip, in your case? It is
                unreasonable. The fact is, Kirylo Sidorovitch, there is not enough known of you to
                give hold to gossip or even calumny. Just now you are a man associated with a great
                deed, which had been hoped for, and tried for too, without success. People have
                perished for attempting that which you and Haldin have done at last. You come to us
                out of Russia, with that prestige. But you cannot deny that you have not been
                communicative, Kirylo Sidorovitch. People you have met imparted their impressions to
                me; one wrote this, another that, but I form my own opinions. I waited to see you
                first. You are a man out of the common. That’s positively so. You are close, very
                close. This taciturnity, this severe brow, this something inflexible and secret in
                you, inspires hopes and a little wonder as to what you may mean. There is something
                of a Brutus . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Pray spare me those classical allusions!” burst out Razumov nervously. “What comes
                Junius Brutus to do here? It is ridiculous! Do you mean to say,” he added
                sarcastically, but lowering his voice, “that the Russian revolutionists are all
                patricians and that I am an aristocrat?”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch, who had been helping himself with a few gestures, clasped his hands
                again behind his back, and made a few steps, pondering.</p>

            <p>“Not <hi>all</hi> patricians,” he muttered at last. “But you, at any rate, are one of
                    <hi>us</hi>.”</p>

            <p>Razumov smiled bitterly.</p>

            <p>“To be sure my name is not Gugenheimer,” he said in a sneering tone. “I am not a
                democratic Jew. How can I help it? Not everybody has such luck. I have no name, I
                have no . . . .”</p>

            <p>The European celebrity showed a great concern. He stepped back a pace and his arms
                flew in front of his person, extended, deprecatory, almost entreating. His deep bass
                voice was full of pain.</p>

            <p>“But, my dear young friend!” he cried. “My dear Kirylo Sidorovitch . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov shook his head.</p>

            <p>“The very patronymic you are so civil as to use when addressing me I have no legal
                right to — but what of that? I don’t wish to claim it. I have no father. So much the
                better. But I will tell you what: my mother’s grandfather was a peasant — a serf.
                See how much I am one of <hi>you</hi>. I don’t want anyone to claim me. But Russia
                    <hi>can’t</hi> disown me. She cannot!”</p>

            <p>Razumov struck his breast with his fist.</p>

            <p>“I am <hi>it</hi>!”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch walked on slowly, his head lowered. Razumov followed, vexed with
                himself. That was not the right sort of talk. All sincerity was an imprudence. Yet
                one could not renounce truth altogether, he thought, with despair. Peter Ivanovitch,
                meditating behind his dark glasses, became to him suddenly so odious that if he had
                had a knife, he fancied he could have stabbed him not only without compunction, but
                with a horrible, triumphant satisfaction. His imagination dwelt on that atrocity in
                spite of himself. It was as if he were becoming light-headed. “ It is not what is
                expected of me,” he repeated to himself. “It is not what is — I could get away by
                breaking the fastening on the little gate I see there in the back wall. It is a
                flimsy lock. Nobody in the house seems to know he is here with me. Oh yes. The hat!
                These women would discover presently the hat he has left on the landing. They would
                come upon him, lying dead in this damp, gloomy shade — but I would be gone and no
                one could ever. . .Lord! Am I going mad?” he asked himself in a fright.</p>

            <p>The great man was heard — musing in an undertone.</p>

            <p>“H’m, yes! That — no doubt — in a certain sense . . . .” He raised his voice. “There
                is a deal of pride about you . . . .”</p>

            <p>The intonation of Peter Ivanovitch took on a homely, familiar ring, acknowledging, in
                a way, Razumov’s claim to peasant descent.</p>

            <p>“A great deal of pride, brother Kirylo. And I don’t say that you have no
                justification for it. I have admitted you had. I have ventured to allude to the
                facts of your birth simply because I attach no mean importance to it. You are one of
                us — <hi>un des notres</hi>. I reflect on that with satisfaction.”</p>

            <p>“I attach some importance to it also,” said Razumov quietly. “I won’t even deny that
                it may have some importance for you too,” he continued, after a slight pause and
                with a touch of grimness of which he was himself aware, with some annoyance. He
                hoped it had escaped the perception of Peter Ivanovitch. “But suppose we talk no
                more about it?”</p>

            <p>“Well, we shall not — not after this one time, Kirylo Sidorovitch,” persisted the
                noble arch- priest of Revolution. “This shall be the last occasion. You cannot
                believe for a moment that I had the slightest idea of wounding your feelings. You
                are clearly a superior nature — that’s how I read you. Quite above the common — h’m
                — susceptibilities. But the fact is, Kirylo Sidorovitch, I don’t know your
                susceptibilities. Nobody, out of Russia, knows much of you — as yet!”</p>

            <p>“You have been watching me?” suggested Razumov.</p>

            <p>“Yes.”</p>

            <p>The great man had spoken in a tone of perfect frankness, but as they turned their
                faces to each other Razumov felt baffled by the dark spectacles. Under their cover,
                Peter Ivanovitch hinted that he had felt for some time the need of meeting a man of
                energy and character, in view of a certain project. He said nothing more precise,
                however; and after some critical remarks upon the personalities of the various
                members of the committee of revolutionary action in Stuttgart, he let the
                conversation lapse for quite a long while. They paced the alley from end to end.
                Razumov, silent too, raised his eyes from time to time to cast a glance at the back
                of the house. It offered no sign of being inhabited. With its grimy, weather-stained
                walls and all the windows shuttered from top to bottom, it looked damp and gloomy
                and deserted. It might very well have been haunted in traditional style by some
                doleful, groaning, futile ghost of a middle-class order. The shades evoked, as
                worldly rumour had it, by Madame de S— to meet statesmen, diplomatists, deputies of
                various European Parliaments, must have been of another sort. Razumov had never seen
                Madame de S__ but in the carriage.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch came out of his abstraction.</p>

            <p>“Two things I may say to you at once. I believe, first, that neither a leader nor any
                decisive action can come out of the dregs of a people. Now, if you ask me what are
                the dregs of a people — h’m — it would take too long to tell. You would be surprised
                at the variety of ingredients that for me go to the making up of these dregs — of
                that which ought, <hi>must</hi> remain at the bottom. Moreover, such a statement
                might be subject to discussion. But I can tell you what is <hi>not</hi> the dregs.
                On that it is impossible for us to disagree. The peasantry of a people is not the
                dregs; neither is its highest class — well — the nobility. Reflect on that, Kirylo
                Sidorovitch! I believe you are well fitted for reflection. Everything in a people
                that is not genuine, not its own by origin or development, is — well — dirt!
                Intelligence in the wrong place is that. Foreign-bred doctrines are that. Dirt!
                Dregs! The second thing I would offer to your meditation is this: that for us at
                this moment there yawns a chasm between the past and the future. It can never be
                bridged by foreign liberalism. All attempts at it are either folly or cheating.
                Bridged it can never be! It has to be filled up.”</p>

            <p>A sort of sinister jocularity had crept into the tones of the burly feminist. He
                seized Razumov’s arm above the elbow, and gave it a slight shake.</p>

            <p>“Do you understand, enigmatical young man? It has got to be just filled up.”</p>

            <p>Razumov kept an unmoved countenance.</p>

            <p>“Don’t you think that I have already gone beyond meditation on that subject?” he
                said, freeing his arm by a quiet movement which increased the distance a little
                between himself and Peter Ivanovitch, as they went on strolling abreast. And he
                added that surely whole cartloads of words and theories could never fill that chasm.
                No meditation was necessary. A sacrifice of many lives could alone — He fell silent
                without finishing the phrase.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch inclined his big hairy head slowly. After a moment he proposed that
                they should go and see if Madame de S— was now visible.</p>

            <p>“We shall get some tea,” he said, turning out of the shaded gloomy walk with a
                brisker step.</p>

            <p>The lady companion had been on the look out. Her dark skirt whisked into the doorway
                as the two men came in sight round the corner. She ran off somewhere altogether, and
                had disappeared when they entered the hall. In the crude light falling from the
                dusty glass skylight upon the black and white tessellated floor, covered with muddy
                tracks, their footsteps echoed faintly. The great feminist led the way up the
                stairs. On the balustrade of the first-floor landing a shiny tall hat reposed, rim
                upwards, opposite the double door of the drawing-room, haunted, it was said, by
                evoked ghosts, and frequented, it was to be supposed, by fugitive revolutionists.
                The cracked white paint of the panels, the tarnished gilt of the mouldings,
                permitted one to imagine nothing but dust and emptiness within. Before turning the
                massive brass handle, Peter Ivanovitch gave his young companion a sharp, partly
                critical, partly preparatory glance.</p>

            <p>“No one is perfect,” he murmured discreetly. Thus, the possessor of a rare jewel
                might, before opening the casket, warn the profane that no gem perhaps is
                flawless.</p>

            <p>He remained with his hand on the door-handle so long that Razumov assented by a moody
                “No.”</p>

            <p>“Perfection itself would not produce that effect,” pursued Peter Ivanovitch, “in a
                world not meant for it. But you shall find there a mind — no! — the quintessence of
                feminine intuition which will understand any perplexity you may be suffering from by
                the irresistible, enlightening force of sympathy. Nothing can remain obscure before
                that — that — inspired, yes, inspired penetration, this true light of
                femininity.”</p>

            <p>The gaze of the dark spectacles in its glossy steadfastness gave his face an air of
                absolute conviction. Razumov felt a momentary shrinking before that closed door.</p>

            <p>“Penetration? Light,” he stammered out. “Do you mean some sort of
                thought-reading?”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch seemed shocked.</p>

            <p>“I mean something utterly different,” he retorted, with a faint, pitying smile.</p>

            <p>Razumov began to feel angry, very much against his wish.</p>

            <p>“This is very mysterious,” he muttered through his teeth.</p>

            <p>“You don’t object to being understood, to being guided?” queried the great feminist.
                Razumov exploded in a fierce whisper.</p>

            <p>“In what sense? Be pleased to understand that I am a serious person. Who do you take
                me for?”</p>

            <p>They looked at each other very closely. Razumov’s temper was cooled by the
                impenetrable earnestness of the blue glasses meeting his stare. Peter Ivanovitch
                turned the handle at last.</p>

            <p>“You shall know directly,” he said, pushing the door open.</p>

            <p>A low-pitched grating voice was heard within the room.</p>

            <p>“<hi>Enfin</hi>.”</p>

            <p>In the doorway, his black-coated bulk blocking the view, Peter Ivanovitch boomed in a
                hearty tone with something boastful in it.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Here I am!”</p>

            <p>He glanced over his shoulder at Razumov, who waited for him to move on.</p>

            <p>“And I am bringing you a proved conspirator — a real one this time. <hi>Un vrai celui
                    la</hi>.”</p>

            <p>This pause in the doorway gave the “proved conspirator” time to make sure that his
                face did not betray his angry curiosity and his mental disgust.</p>

            <p>These sentiments stand confessed in Mr. Razumov’s memorandum of his first interview
                with Madame de S——. The very words I use in my narrative are written where their
                sincerity cannot be suspected. The record, which could not have been meant for
                anyone’s eyes but his own, was not, I think, the outcome of that strange impulse of
                indiscretion common to men who lead secret lives, and accounting for the invariable
                existence of “compromising documents” in all the plots and conspiracies of history.
                Mr. Razumov looked at it, I suppose, as a man looks at himself in a mirror, with
                wonder, perhaps with anguish, with anger or despair. Yes, as a threatened man may
                look fearfully at his own face in the glass, formulating to himself reassuring
                excuses for his appearance marked by the taint of some insidious hereditary
                disease.</p>

            <p>The Egeria of the “Russian Mazzini” produced, at first view, a strong effect by the
                death-like immobility of an obviously painted face. The eyes appeared
                extraordinarily brilliant. The figure, in a close-fitting dress, admirably made, but
                by no means fresh, had an elegant stiffness. The rasping voice inviting him to sit
                down; the rigidity of the upright attitude with one arm extended along the back of
                the sofa, the white gleam of the big eyeballs setting off the black, fathomless
                stare of the enlarged pupils, impressed Razumov more than anything he had seen since
                his hasty and secret departure from St. Petersburg. A witch in Parisian clothes, he
                thought. A portent! He actually hesitated in his advance, and did not even
                comprehend, at first, what the rasping voice was saying.</p>

            <p>“Sit down. Draw your chair nearer me. There —”</p>

            <p>He sat down. At close quarters the rouged cheekbones, the wrinkles, the fine lines on
                each side of the vivid lips, astounded him. He was being received graciously, with a
                smile which made him think of a grinning skull.</p>

            <p>“We have been hearing about you for some time.”</p>

            <p>He did not know what to say, and murmured some disconnected words. The grinning skull
                effect vanished.</p>

            <p>“And do you know that the general complaint is that you have shown yourself very
                reserved everywhere?”</p>

            <p>Razumov remained silent for a time, thinking of his answer.</p>

            <p>“I, don’t you see, am a man of action,” he said huskily, glancing upwards.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch stood in portentous expectant silence by the side of his chair. A
                slight feeling of nausea came over Razumov. What could be the relations of these two
                people to each other? She like a galvanized corpse out of some Hoffman’s Tale — he
                the preacher of feminist gospel for all the world, and a super- revolutionist
                besides! This ancient, painted mummy with unfathomable eyes, and this burly,
                bull-necked, deferential. . .what was it? Witchcraft, fascination. . . . “It’s for
                her money,” he thought. “She has millions!”</p>

            <p>The walls, the floor of the room were bare like a barn. The few pieces of furniture
                had been discovered in the garrets and dragged down into service without having been
                properly dusted, even. It was the refuse the banker’s widow had left behind her. The
                windows without curtains had an indigent, sleepless look. In two of them the dirty
                yellowy-white blinds had been pulled down. All this spoke, not of poverty, but of
                sordid penuriousness.</p>

            <p>The hoarse voice on the sofa uttered angrily-</p>

            <p>“You are looking round, Kirylo Sidorovitch. I have been shamefully robbed, positively
                ruined.”</p>

            <p>A rattling laugh, which seemed beyond her control, interrupted her for a moment.</p>

            <p>“A slavish nature would find consolation in the fact that the principal robber was an
                exalted and almost a sacrosanct person — a Grand Duke, in fact. Do you understand,
                Mr. Razumov? A Grand Duke — No! You have no idea what thieves those people are!
                Downright thieves!”</p>

            <p>Her bosom heaved, but her left arm remained rigidly extended along the back of the
                couch.</p>

            <p>“You will only upset yourself,” breathed out a deep voice, which, to Razumov’s
                startled glance, seemed to proceed from under the steady spectacles of Peter
                Ivanovitch, rather than from his lips, which had hardly moved.</p>

            <p>“What of hat? I say thieves! <hi>Voleurs! Voleurs!</hi>”</p>

            <p>Razumov was quite confounded by this unexpected clamour, which had in it something of
                wailing and croaking, and more than a suspicion of hysteria.</p>

            <p>“<hi>Voleurs! Voleurs! Vol</hi> . . . .”</p>

            <p>“No power on earth can rob you of your genius,” shouted Peter Ivanovitch in an
                overpowering bass, but without stirring, without a gesture of any kind. A profound
                silence fell.</p>

            <p>Razumov remained outwardly impassive. “What is the meaning of this performance?” he
                was asking himself. But with a preliminary sound of bumping outside some door behind
                him, the lady companion, in a threadbare black skirt and frayed blouse, came in
                rapidly, walking on her heels, and carrying in both hands a big Russian samovar,
                obviously too heavy for her. Razumov made an instinctive movement to help, which
                startled her so much that she nearly dropped her hissing burden. She managed,
                however, to land it on the table, and looked so frightened that Razumov hastened to
                sit down. She produced then, from an adjacent room, four glass tumblers, a teapot,
                and a sugar-basin, on a black iron tray.</p>

            <p>The rasping voice asked from the sofa abruptly —</p>

            <p>“<hi>Les gateaux</hi>? Have you remembered to bring the cakes?”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch, without a word, marched out on to the landing, and returned
                instantly with a parcel wrapped up in white glazed paper, which he must have
                extracted from the interior of his hat. With imperturbable gravity he undid the
                string and smoothed the paper open on a part of the table within reach of Madame de
                S——‘s hand. The lady companion poured out the tea, then retired into a distant
                corner out of everybody’s sight. From time to time Madame de S—— extended a
                claw-like hand, glittering with costly rings, towards the paper of cakes, took up
                one and devoured it, displaying her big false teeth ghoulishly. Meantime she talked
                in a hoarse tone of the political situation in the Balkans. She built great hopes on
                some complication in the peninsula for arousing a great movement of national
                indignation in Russia against “these thieves — thieves thieves.”</p>

            <p>“You will only upset yourself,” Peter Ivanovitch interposed, raising his glassy gaze.
                He smoked cigarettes and drank tea in silence, continuously. When he had finished a
                glass, he flourished his hand above his shoulder. At that signal the lady companion,
                ensconced in her corner, with round eyes like a watchful animal, would dart out to
                the table and pour him out another tumblerful.</p>

            <p>Razumov looked at her once or twice. She was anxious, tremulous, though neither
                Madame de S—— nor Peter Ivanovitch paid the slightest attention to her. “What have
                they done between them to that forlorn creature?” Razumov asked himself. “Have they
                terrified her out of her senses with ghosts, or simply have they only been beating
                her?” When she gave him his second glass of tea, he noticed that her lips trembled
                in the manner of a scared person about to burst into speech. But of course she said
                nothing, and retired into her corner, as if hugging to herself the smile of thanks
                he gave her.</p>

            <p>“She may be worth cultivating,” thought Razumov suddenly.</p>

            <p>He was calming down, getting hold of the actuality into which he had been thrown —
                for the first time perhaps since Victor Haldin had entered his room. . .and had gone
                out again. He was distinctly aware of being the object of the famous — or notorious
                — Madame de S——‘s ghastly graciousness.</p>

            <p>Madame de S—— was pleased to discover that this young man was different from the
                other types of revolutionist members of committees, secret emissaries, vulgar and
                unmannerly fugitive professors, rough students, ex-cobblers with apostolic faces,
                consumptive and ragged enthusiasts, Hebrew youths, common fellows of all sorts that
                used to come and go around Peter Ivanovitch — fanatics, pedants, proletarians all.
                It was pleasant to talk to this young man of notably good appearance — for Madame de
                S—— was not always in a mystical state of mind. Razumov’s taciturnity only excited
                her to a quicker, more voluble utterance. It still dealt with the Balkans. She knew
                all the statesmen of that region, Turks, Bulgarians, Montenegrins, Roumanians,
                Greeks, Armenians, and nondescripts, young and old, the living and the dead. With
                some money an intrigue could be started which would set the Peninsula in a blaze and
                outrage the sentiment of the Russian people. A cry of abandoned brothers could be
                raised, and then, with the nation seething with indignation, a couple of regiments
                or so would be enough to begin a military revolution in St. Petersburg and make an
                end of these thieves . . . .</p>

            <p>“Apparently I’ve got only to sit still and listen,” the silent Razumov thought to
                himself. “As to that hairy and obscene brute” (in such terms did Mr. Razumov refer
                mentally to the popular expounder of a feministic conception of social state), “as
                to him, for all his cunning he too shall speak out some day.”</p>

            <p>Razumov ceased to think for a moment. Then a sombre-toned reflection formulated
                itself in his mind, ironical and bitter. “I have the gift of inspiring confidence.”
                He heard himself laughing aloud. It was like a goad to the painted, shiny-eyed
                harridan on the sofa.</p>

            <p>“You may well laugh!” she cried hoarsely. “What else can one do! Perfect swindlers —
                and what base swindlers at that! Cheap Germans — Holstein- Gottorps! Though, indeed,
                it’s hardly safe to say who and what they are. A family that counts a creature like
                Catherine the Great in its ancestry — you understand!”</p>

            <p>“You are only upsetting yourself,” said Peter Ivanovitch, patiently but in a firm
                tone. This admonition had its usual effect on the Egeria. She dropped her thick,
                discoloured eyelids and changed her position on the sofa. All her angular and
                lifeless movements seemed completely automatic now that her eyes were closed.
                Presently she opened them very full. Peter Ivanovitch drank tea steadily, without
                haste.</p>

            <p>“Well, I declare!” She addressed Razumov directly. “The people who have seen you on
                your way here are right. You are very reserved. You haven’t said twenty words
                altogether since you came in. You let nothing of your thoughts be seen in your face
                either.”</p>

            <p>“I have been listening, Madame,” said Razumov, using French for the first time,
                hesitatingly, not being certain of his accent. But it seemed to produce an excellent
                impression. Madame de S- — looked meaningly into Peter Ivanovitch’s spectacles, as
                if to convey her conviction of this young man’s merit. She even nodded the least bit
                in his direction, and Razumov heard her murmur under her breath the words, “ Later
                on in the diplomatic service,” which could not but refer to the favourable
                impression he had made. The fantastic absurdity of it revolted him because it seemed
                to outrage his ruined hopes with the vision of a mock-career. Peter Ivanovitch,
                impassive as though he were deaf, drank some more tea. Razumov felt that he must say
                something.</p>

            <p>“Yes,” he began deliberately, as if uttering a meditated opinion. “Clearly. Even in
                planning a purely military revolution the temper of the people should be taken into
                account.”</p>

            <p>“You have understood me perfectly. The discontent should be spiritualized. That is
                what the ordinary heads of revolutionary committees will not understand. They aren’t
                capable of it. For instance, Mordatiev was in Geneva last month. Peter Ivanovitch
                brought him here. You know Mordatiev? Well, yes — you have heard of him. They call
                him an eagle — a hero! He has never done half as much as you have. Never attempted —
                not half . . . .”</p>

            <p>Madame de S—— agitated herself angularly on the sofa.</p>

            <p>“We, of course, talked to him. And do you know what he said to me? ‘What have we to
                do with Balkan intrigues? We must simply extirpate the scoundrels.’ Extirpate is all
                very well — but what then? The imbecile! I screamed at him, ‘But you must
                spiritualize — don’t you understand? — spiritualize the discontent.’. . .”</p>

            <p>She felt nervously in her pocket for a handkerchief; she pressed it to her lips.</p>

            <p>“Spiritualize?” said Razumov interrogatively, watching her heaving breast. The long
                ends of an old black lace scarf she wore over her head slipped off her shoulders and
                hung down on each side of her ghastly rosy cheeks.</p>

            <p>“An odious creature,” she burst out again. “Imagine a man who takes five lumps of
                sugar in his tea. . . . Yes, I said spiritualize! How else can you make discontent
                effective and universal?”</p>

            <p>“Listen to this, young man.” Peter Ivanovitch made himself heard solemnly. “Effective
                and universal.”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked at him suspiciously.</p>

            <p>“Some say hunger will do that,” he remarked.</p>

            <p>“Yes. I know. Our people are starving in heaps. But you can’t make famine universal.
                And it is not despair that we want to create. There is no moral support to be got
                out of that. It is indignation . . . .”</p>

            <p>Madame de S—— let her thin, extended arm sink on her knees.</p>

            <p>“I am not a Mordatiev,” began Razumov.</p>

            <p>“Bien sur!” murmured Madame de S——.</p>

            <p>“Though I too am ready to say extirpate, extirpate! But in my ignorance of political
                work, permit me to ask: A Balkan — well — intrigue, wouldn’t that take a very long
                time?”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch got up and moved off quietly, to stand with his face to the window.
                Razumov heard a door close; he turned his head and perceived that the lady companion
                had scuttled out of the room.</p>

            <p>“In matters of politics I am a supernaturalist.” Madame de S—— broke the silence
                harshly.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch moved away from the window and struck Razumov lightly on the
                shoulder. This was a signal for leaving, but at the same time he addressed Madame de
                S—— in a peculiar reminding tone —</p>

            <p>“Eleanor!”</p>

            <p>Whatever it meant, she did not seem to hear him. She leaned back in the corner of the
                sofa like a wooden figure. The immovable peevishness of the face, framed in the
                limp, rusty lace, had a character of cruelty.</p>

            <p>“As to extirpating,” she croaked at the attentive Razumov, “there is only one class
                in Russia which must be extirpated. Only one. And that class consists of only one
                family. You understand me? That one family must be extirpated.”</p>

            <p>Her rigidity was frightful, like the rigor of a corpse galvanized into harsh speech
                and glittering stare by the force of murderous hate. The sight fascinated Razumov —
                yet he felt more self-possessed than at any other time since he had entered this
                weirdly bare room. He was interested. But the great feminist by his side again
                uttered his appeal —</p>

            <p>“Eleanor!”</p>

            <p>She disregarded it. Her carmine lips vaticinated with an extraordinary rapidity. The
                liberating spirit would use arms before which rivers would part like Jordan, and
                ramparts fall down like the walls of Jericho. The deliverance from bondage would be
                effected by plagues and by signs, by wonders and by war. The women . . . .</p>

            <p>“Eleanor!”</p>

            <p>She ceased; she had heard him at last. She pressed her hand to her forehead.</p>

            <p>“What is it? Ah yes! That girl — the sister of . . . .”</p>

            <p>It was Miss Haldin that she meant. That young girl and her mother had been leading a
                very retired life. They were provincial ladies — were they not? The mother had been
                very beautiful — traces were left yet. Peter Ivanovitch, when he called there for
                the first time, was greatly struck. . . . But the cold way they received him was
                really surprising.</p>

            <p>“He is one of our national glories,” Madams de S- — cried out, with sudden vehemence.
                “All the world listens to him.”</p>

            <p>“I don’t know these ladies,” said Razumov loudly rising from his chair.</p>

            <p>“What are you saying, Kirylo Sidorovitch? I understand that she was talking to you
                here, in the garden, the other day.”</p>

            <p>“Yes, in the garden,” said Razumov gloomily. Then, with an effort, “She made herself
                known to me.”</p>

            <p>“And then ran away from us all,” Madame de S—— continued, with ghastly vivacity.
                “After coming to the very door! What a peculiar proceeding! Well, I have been a shy
                little provincial girl at one time. Yes, Razumov” (she fell into this familiarity
                intentionally, with an appalling grimace of graciousness. Razumov gave a perceptible
                start), “yes, that’s my origin. A simple provincial family.”</p>

            <p>“You are a marvel,” Peter Ivanovich uttered.</p>

            <p>But it was to Razumov that she gave her death’s-head smile. Her tone was quite
                imperious.</p>

            <p>“You must bring the wild young thing here. She is wanted. I reckon upon your success
                — mind!”</p>

            <p>“She is not a wild young thing,” muttered Razumov, in a surly voice.</p>

            <p>“Well, then — that’s all the same. She may be one of these young conceited democrats.
                Do you know what I think? I think she is very much like you in character. There is a
                smouldering fire of scorn in you. You are darkly self- sufficient, but I can see
                your very soul.”</p>

            <p>Her shiny eyes had a dry, intense stare, which, missing Razumov, gave him an absurd
                notion that she was looking at something which was visible to her behind him. He
                cursed himself for an impressionable fool, and asked with forced calmness —</p>

            <p>“What is it you see? Anything resembling me?”</p>

            <p>She moved her rigidly set face from left to right, negatively.</p>

            <p>“Some sort of phantom in my image?” pursued Razumov slowly. “For, I suppose, a soul
                when it is seen is just that. A vain thing. There are phantoms of the living as well
                as of the dead.”</p>

            <p>The tenseness of Madame de S——‘s stare had relaxed, and now she looked at Razumov in
                a silence that became disconcerting.</p>

            <p>“I myself have had an experience,” he stammered out, as if compelled. “ I’ve seen a
                phantom once.” The unnaturally red lips moved to frame a question harshly.</p>

            <p>“Of a dead person?”</p>

            <p>“No. Living.”</p>

            <p>“A friend?”</p>

            <p>“No.”</p>

            <p>“An enemy?”</p>

            <p>“I hated him.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! It was not a woman, then?”</p>

            <p>“A woman!” repeated Razumov, his eyes looking straight into the eyes of Madame de
                S——. “Why should it have been a woman? And why this conclusion? Why should I not
                have been able to hate a woman?”</p>

            <p>As a matter of fact, the idea of hating a woman was new to him. At that moment he
                hated Madame de S——. But it was not exactly hate. It was more like the abhorrence
                that may be caused by a wooden or plaster figure of a repulsive kind. She moved no
                more than if she were such a figure; even her eyes, whose unwinking stare plunged
                into his own, though shining, were lifeless, as though they were as artificial as
                her teeth. For the first time Razumov became aware of a faint perfume, but faint as
                it was it nauseated him exceedingly. Again Peter Ivanovitch tapped him slightly on
                the shoulder. Thereupon he bowed, and was about to turn away when he received the
                unexpected favour of a bony, inanimate hand extended to him, with the two words in
                hoarse French —</p>

            <p>“<hi>Au revoir!</hi>”</p>

            <p>He bowed over the skeleton hand and left the room, escorted by the great man, who
                made him go out first. The voice from the sofa cried after them-</p>

            <p>“You remain here, <hi>Pierre</hi>.”</p>

            <p>“Certainly, <hi>ma chere amie</hi>.”</p>

            <p>But he left the room with Razumov, shutting the door behind him. The landing was
                prolonged into a bare corridor, right and left, desolate perspectives of white and
                gold decoration without a strip of carpet. The very light, pouring through a large
                window at the end, seemed dusty; and a solitary speck reposing on the balustrade of
                white marble — the silk top-hat of the great feminist — asserted itself extremely,
                black and glossy in all that crude whiteness.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch escorted the visitor without opening his lips. Even when they had
                reached the head of the stairs Peter Ivanovitch did not break the silence. Razumov’s
                impulse to continue down the flight and out of the house without as much as a nod
                abandoned him suddenly. He stopped on the first step and leaned his back against the
                wall. Below him the great hall with its chequered floor of black and white seemed
                absurdly large and like some public place where a great power of resonance awaits
                the provocation of footfalls and voices. As if afraid of awakening the loud echoes
                of that empty house, Razumov adopted a low tone.</p>

            <p>“I really have no mind to turn into a dilettante spiritualist.”</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch shook his head slightly, very serious.</p>

            <p>“Or spend my time in spiritual ecstasies or sublime meditations upon the gospel of
                feminism,” continued Razumov. “I made my way here for my share of action — action,
                most respected Peter Ivanovitch! It was not the great European writer who attracted
                me, here, to this odious town of liberty. It was somebody much greater. It was the
                idea of the chief which attracted me. There are starving young men in Russia who
                believe in you so much that it seems the only thing that keeps them alive in their
                misery. Think of that, Peter Ivanovitch! No! But only think of that!”</p>

            <p>The great man, thus entreated, perfectly motionless and silent, was the very image of
                patient, placid respectability.</p>

            <p>“Of course I don’t speak of the people. They are brutes,” added Razumov, in the same
                subdued but forcible tone. At this, a protesting murmur issued from the “heroic
                fugitive’s” beard. A murmur of authority.</p>

            <p>“Say — children.”</p>

            <p>“No! Brutes!” Razumov insisted bluntly.</p>

            <p>“But they are sound, they are innocent,” the great man pleaded in a whisper.</p>

            <p>“As far as that goes, a brute is sound enough.” Razumov raised his voice at last.
                “And you can’t deny the natural innocence of a brute. But what’s the use of
                disputing about names? You just try to give these children the power and stature of
                men and see what they will be like. You just give it to them and see. . . . But
                never mind. I tell you, Peter Ivanovitch, that half a dozen young men do not come
                together nowadays in a shabby student’s room without your name being whispered, not
                as a leader of thought, but as a centre of revolutionary energies — the centre of
                action. What else has drawn me near you, do you think? It is not what all the world
                knows of you, surely. It’s precisely what the world at large does not know. I was
                irresistibly drawn-let us say impelled, yes, impelled; or, rather, compelled, driven
                — driven,’’ repented Razumov loudly, and ceased, as if startled by the hollow
                reverberation of the word “driven” along two bare corridors and in the great empty
                hall.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch did not seem startled in the least. The young man could not control
                a dry, uneasy laugh. The great revolutionist remained unmoved with an effect of
                commonplace, homely superiority.</p>

            <p>“Curse him,” said Razumov to himself, “he is waiting behind his spectacles for me to
                give myself away.” Then aloud, with a satanic enjoyment of the scorn prompting him
                to play with the greatness of the great man —</p>

            <p>“Ah, Peter Ivanovitch, if you only knew the force which drew — no, which
                    <hi>drove</hi> me towards you! The irresistible force.”</p>

            <p>He did not feel any desire to laugh now. This time Peter Ivanovitch moved his head
                sideways, knowingly, as much as to say, “Don’t I?” This expressive movement was
                almost imperceptible. Razumov went on in secret derision —</p>

            <p>“All these days you have been trying to read me, Peter Ivanovitch. That is natural. I
                have perceived it and I have been frank. Perhaps you may think I have not been very
                expansive? But with a man like you it was not needed; it would have looked like an
                impertinence, perhaps. And besides, we Russians are prone to talk too much as a
                rule. I have always felt that. And yet, as a nation, we are dumb. I assure you that
                I am not likely to talk to you so much again — ha! ha! —”</p>

            <p>Razumov, still keeping on the lower step, came a little nearer to the great man.</p>

            <p>“You have been condescending enough. I quite understood it was to lead me on. You
                must render me the justice that I have not tried to please. I have been impelled,
                compelled, or rather sent — let us say sent — towards you for a work that no one but
                myself can do. You would call it a harmless delusion: a ridiculous delusion at which
                you don’t even smile. It is absurd of me to talk like this, yet some day you shall
                remember these words, I hope. Enough of this. Here I stand before you-confessed! But
                one thing more I must add to complete it: a mere blind tool I can never consent to
                be.”</p>

            <p>Whatever acknowledgment Razumov was prepared for, he was not prepared to have both
                his hands seized in the great man’s grasp. The swiftness of the movement was
                aggressive enough to startle. The burly feminist could not have been quicker had his
                purpose been to jerk Razumov treacherously up on the landing and bundle him behind
                one of the numerous closed doors near by. This idea actually occurred to Razumov;
                his hands being released after a darkly eloquent squeeze, he smiled, with a beating
                heart, straight at the beard and the spectacles hiding that impenetrable man.</p>

            <p>He thought to himself (it stands confessed in his handwriting), “I won’t move from
                here till he either speaks or turns away. This is a duel.” Many seconds passed
                without a sign or sound.</p>

            <p>“Yes, yes,” the great man said hurriedly, in subdued tones, as if the whole thing had
                been a stolen, breathless interview. “Exactly. Come to see us here in a few days.
                This must be gone into deeply — deeply, between you and me. Quite to the bottom. To
                the. . . . And, by the by, you must bring along Natalia Victorovna — you know, the
                Haldin girl . . . .</p>

            <p>“Am I to take this as my first instruction from you?” inquired Razumov stiffly.</p>

            <p>Peter Ivanovitch seemed perplexed by this new attitude.</p>

            <p>“Ah! h’m! You are naturally the proper person — <hi>la personne indiquee</hi>. Every
                one shall be wanted presently. Every one.”</p>

            <p>He bent down from the landing over Razumov, who had lowered his eyes.</p>

            <p>“The moment of action approaches,’’ he murmured.</p>

            <p>Razumov did not look up. He did not move till he heard the door of the drawing-room
                close behind the greatest of feminists returning to his painted Egeria. Then he
                walked down slowly into the hall. The door stood open, and the shadow of the house
                was lying aslant over the greatest part of the terrace. While crossing it slowly, he
                lifted his hat and wiped his damp forehead, expelling his breath with force to get
                rid of the last vestiges of the air he had been breathing inside. He looked at the
                palms of his hands, and rubbed them gently against his thighs.</p>

            <p>He felt, bizarre as it may seem, as though another self, an independent sharer of his
                mind, had been able to view his whole person very distinctly indeed. “This is
                curious,” he thought. After a while he formulated his opinion of it in the mental
                ejaculation: “Beastly!” This disgust vanished before a marked uneasiness. “This is
                an effect of nervous exhaustion,” he reflected with weary sagacity. “How am I to go
                on day after day if I have no more power of resistance — moral resistance?”</p>

            <p>He followed the path at the foot of the terrace. “Moral resistance, moral
                resistance;” he kept on repeating these words mentally. Moral endurance. Yes, that
                was the necessity of the situation. An immense longing to make his way out of these
                grounds and to the other end of the town, of throwing himself on his bed and going
                to sleep for hours, swept everything clean out of his mind for a moment. “Is it
                possible that I am but a weak creature after all?” he asked himself, in sudden
                alarm. “Eh! What’s that?”</p>

            <p>He gave a start as if awakened from a dream. He even swayed a little before
                recovering himself.</p>

            <p>“Ah! You stole away from us quietly to walk about here,” he said.</p>

            <p>The lady companion stood before him, but how she came there he had not the slightest
                idea. Her folded arms were closely cherishing the cat.</p>

            <p>“I have been unconscious as I walked, it’s a positive fact,” said Razumov to himself
                in wonder. He raised his hat with marked civility.</p>

            <p>The sallow woman blushed duskily. She had her invariably scared expression, as if
                somebody had just disclosed to her some terrible news. But she held her ground,
                Razumov noticed, without timidity. “She is incredibly shabby,” he thought. In the
                sunlight her black costume looked greenish, with here and there threadbare patches
                where the stuff seemed decomposed by age into a velvety, black, furry state. Her
                very hair and eyebrows looked shabby. Razumov wondered whether she were sixty years
                old. Her figure, though, was young enough. He observed that she did not appear
                starved, but rather as if she had been fed on unwholesome scraps and leavings of
                plates.</p>

            <p>Razumov smiled amiably and moved out of her way. She turned her head to keep her
                scared eyes on him.</p>

            <p>“I know what you have been told in there,” she affirmed, without preliminaries. Her
                tone, in contrast with her manner, had an unexpectedly assured character which put
                Razumov at his ease.</p>

            <p>“Do you? You must have heard all sorts of talk on many occasions in there.”</p>

            <p>She varied her phrase, with the same incongruous effect of positiveness.</p>

            <p>“I know to a certainty what you have been told to do.”</p>

            <p>“Really?” Razumov shrugged his shoulders a little. He was about to pass on with a
                bow, when a sudden thought struck him. “Yes. To be sure! In your confidential
                position you are aware of many things,” he murmured, looking at the cat.</p>

            <p>That animal got a momentary convulsive hug from the lady companion.</p>

            <p>“Everything was disclosed to me a long time ago,” she said.</p>

            <p>“Everything,” Razumov repeated absently.</p>

            <p>“Peter Ivanovitch is an awful despot,” she jerked out.</p>

            <p>Razumov went on studying the stripes on the grey fur of the cat.</p>

            <p>“An iron will is an integral part of such a temperament. How else could he be a
                leader? And I think that you are mistaken in —”</p>

            <p>“There!” she cried. “ You tell me that I am mistaken. But I tell you all the same
                that he cares for no one.” She jerked her head up. “Don’t you bring that girl here.
                That’s what you have been told to do — to bring that girl here. Listen to me; you
                had better tie a stone round her neck and throw her into the lake.”</p>

            <p>Razumov had a sensation of chill and gloom, as if a heavy cloud had passed over the
                sun.</p>

            <p>“The girl?” he said. “What have I to do with her?”</p>

            <p>“But you have been told to bring Nathalie Haldin here. Am I not right? Of course I am
                right. I was not in the room, but I know. I know Peter Ivanovitch sufficiently well.
                He is a great man. Great men are horrible. Well, that’s it. Have nothing to do with
                her. That’s the best you can do, unless you want her to become like me —
                disillusioned! Disillusioned!”</p>

            <p>“Like you,” repeated Razumov, glaring at her face, as devoid of all comeliness of
                feature and complexion as the most miserable beggar is of money. He smiled, still
                feeling chilly: a peculiar sensation which annoyed him.” Disillusioned as to Peter
                Ivanovitch! Is that all you have lost?”</p>

            <p>She declared, looking frightened, but with immense conviction, “Peter Ivanovitch
                stands for everything.” Then she added, in another tone, “Keep the girl away from
                this house.”</p>

            <p>“And are you absolutely inciting me to disobey Peter Ivanovitch just because —
                because you are disillusioned?”</p>

            <p>She began to blink.</p>

            <p>“Directly I saw you for the first time I was comforted. You took your hat off to me.
                You looked as if one could trust you. Oh!”</p>

            <p>She shrank before Razumov’s savage snarl of, “I have heard something like this
                before.”</p>

            <p>She was so confounded that she could do nothing but blink for a long time.</p>

            <p>“It was your humane manner,” she explained plaintively. “I have been starving for, I
                won’t say kindness, but just for a little civility, for I don’t know how long. And
                now you are angry . . . .”</p>

            <p>“But no, on the contrary,” he protested. “ I am very glad you trust me. It’s possible
                that later on I may . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes, if you were to get ill,” she interrupted eagerly, “ or meet some bitter
                trouble, you would find I am not a useless fool. You have only to let me know. I
                will come to you. I will indeed. And I will stick to you. Misery and I are old
                acquaintances — but this life here is worse than starving.”</p>

            <p>She paused anxiously, then in a voice for the first time sounding really timid, she
                added —</p>

            <p>“Or if you were engaged in some dangerous work. Sometimes a humble companion — I
                would not want to know anything. I would follow you with joy. I could carry out
                orders. I have the courage.”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked attentively at the scared round eyes, at the withered, sallow, round
                cheeks. They were quivering about the corners of the mouth.</p>

            <p>“She wants to escape from here,” he thought.</p>

            <p>“Suppose I were to tell you that I am engaged in dangerous work?” he uttered
                slowly.</p>

            <p>She pressed the cat to her threadbare bosom with a breathless exclamation. “Ah!” Then
                not much above a whisper: “Under Peter Ivanovitch?”</p>

            <p>“No, not under Peter Ivanovitch.”</p>

            <p>He read admiration in her eyes, and made an effort to smile.</p>

            <p>“Then — alone?”</p>

            <p>He held up his closed hand with the index raised. “Like this finger,” he said.</p>

            <p>She was trembling slightly. But it occurred to Razumov that they might have been
                observed from the house, and he became anxious to be gone. She blinked, raising up
                to him her puckered face, and seemed to beg mutely to be told something more, to be
                given a word of encouragement for her starving, grotesque, and pathetic
                devotion.</p>

            <p>“Can we be seen from the house?” asked Razumov confidentially.</p>

            <p>She answered, without showing the slightest surprise at the question —</p>

            <p>“No, we can’t, on account of this end of the stables.” And she added, with an
                acuteness which surprised Razumov,” But anybody looking out of an upstairs window
                would know that you have not passed through the gates yet.”</p>

            <p>“Who’s likely to spy out of the window?” queried Razumov. “Peter Ivanovitch?”</p>

            <p>She nodded.</p>

            <p>“Why should he trouble his head?”</p>

            <p>“He expects somebody this afternoon.”</p>

            <p>“You know the person?”</p>

            <p>“There’s more than one.”</p>

            <p>She had lowered her eyelids. Razumov looked at her curiously.</p>

            <p>“Of course. You hear everything they say.”</p>

            <p>She murmured without any animosity —</p>

            <p>“So do the tables and chairs.”</p>

            <p>He understood that the bitterness accumulated in the heart of that helpless creature
                had got into her veins, and, like some subtle poison, had decomposed her fidelity to
                that hateful pair. It was a great piece of luck for him, he reflected; because women
                are seldom venal after the manner of men, who can be bought for material
                considerations. She would be a good ally, though it was not likely that she was
                allowed to hear as much as the tables and chairs of the Chateau Borel. That could
                not be expected. But still. . . . And, at any rate, she could be made to talk.</p>

            <p>When she looked up her eyes met the fixed stare of Razumov, who began to speak at
                once.</p>

            <p>“Well, well, dear. . .but upon my word, I haven’t the pleasure of knowing your name
                yet. Isn’t it strange?”</p>

            <p>For the first time she made a movement of the shoulders.</p>

            <p>“Is it strange? No one is told my name. No one cares. No one talks to me, no one
                writes to me. My parents don’t even know if I’m alive. I have no use for a name, and
                I have almost forgotten it myself.”</p>

            <p>Razumov murmured gravely, “Yes, but still. . .”</p>

            <p>She went on much slower, with indifference —</p>

            <p>“You may call me Tekla, then. My poor Andrei called me so. I was devoted to him. He
                lived in wretchedness and suffering, and died in misery. That is the lot of all us
                Russians, nameless Russians. There is nothing else for us, and no hope anywhere,
                unless. . .”</p>

            <p>“Unless what?”</p>

            <p>“Unless all these people with names are done away with,” she finished, blinking and
                pursing up her lips.</p>

            <p>“It will be easier to call you Tekla, as you direct me,” said Razumov, “if you
                consent to call me Kirylo, when we are talking like this — quietly — only you and
                me.”</p>

            <p>And he said to himself, “Here’s a being who must be terribly afraid of the world,
                else she would have run away from this situation before.” Then he reflected that the
                mere fact of leaving the great man abruptly would make her a suspect. She could
                expect no support or countenance from anyone. This revolutionist was not fit for an
                independent existence.</p>

            <p>She moved with him a few steps, blinking and nursing the cat with a small balancing
                movement of her arms.</p>

            <p>“Yes — only you and I. That’s how I was with my poor Andrei, only he was dying,
                killed by these official brutes — while you! You are strong. You kill the monsters.
                You have done a great deed. Peter Ivanovitch himself must consider you. Well — don’t
                forget me — especially if you are going back to work in Russia. I could follow you,
                carrying anything that was wanted — at a distance, you know. Or I could watch for
                hours at the corner of a street if necessary — in wet or snow — yes, I could — all
                day long. Or I could write for you dangerous documents, lists of names or
                instructions, so that in case of mischance the handwriting could not compromise you.
                And you need not be afraid if they were to catch me. I would know how to keep dumb.
                We women are not so easily daunted by pain. I heard Peter Ivanovitch say it is our
                blunt nerves or something. We can stand it better. And it’s true; I would just as
                soon bite my tongue out and throw it at them as not. What’s the good of speech to
                me? Who would ever want to hear what I could say? Ever since I closed the eyes of my
                poor Andrei I haven’t met a man who seemed to care for the sound of my voice. I
                should never have spoken to you if the very first time you appeared here you had not
                taken notice of me so nicely. I could not help speaking of you to that charming dear
                girl. Oh, the sweet creature! And strong! One can see that at once. If you have a
                heart don’t let her set her foot in here. Good-bye!”</p>

            <p>Razumov caught her by the arm. Her emotion at being thus seized manifested itself by
                a short struggle, after which she stood still, not looking at him.</p>

            <p>“But you can tell me,” he spoke in her ear, “why they — these people in that house
                there — are so anxious to get hold of her?”</p>

            <p>She freed herself to turn upon him, as if made angry by the question.</p>

            <p>“Don’t you understand that Peter Ivanovitch must direct, inspire, influence? It is
                the breath of his life. There can never be too many disciples. He can’t bear
                thinking of anyone escaping him. And a woman, too! There is nothing to be done
                without women, he says. He has written it. He —”</p>

            <p>The young man was staring at her passion when she broke off suddenly and ran away
                behind the stable.</p>

            <head>3</head>


            <p>Razumov, thus left to himself, took the direction of the gate. But on this day of
                many conversations, he discovered that very probably he could not leave the grounds
                without having to hold another one.</p>

            <p>Stepping in view from beyond the lodge appeared the expected visitors of Peter
                Ivanovitch: a small party composed of two men and a woman. They noticed him too,
                immediately, and stopped short as if to consult. But in a moment the woman, moving
                aside, motioned with her arm to the two men, who, leaving the drive at once, struck
                across the large neglected lawn, or rather grass-plot, and made directly for the
                house. The woman remained on the path waiting for Razumov’s approach. She had
                recognized him. He, too, had recognized her at the first glance. He had been made
                known to her at Zurich, where he had broken his journey while on his way from
                Dresden. They had been much together for the three days of his stay.</p>

            <p>She was wearing the very same costume in which he had seen her first. A blouse of
                crimson silk made her noticeable at a distance. With that she wore a short brown
                skirt and a leather belt. Her complexion was the colour of coffee and milk, but very
                clear; her eyes black and glittering, her figure erect. A lot of thick hair, nearly
                white, was done up loosely under a dusty Tyrolese hat of dark cloth, which seemed to
                have lost some of its trimmings.</p>

            <p>The expression of her face was grave, intent; so grave that Razumov, after
                approaching her close, felt obliged to smile. She greeted him with a manly
                hand-grasp.</p>

            <p>“What! Are you going away?” she exclaimed. “How is that, Razumov?”</p>

            <p>“I am going away because I haven’t been asked to stay,” Razumov answered, returning
                the pressure of her hand with much less force than she had put into it.</p>

            <p>She jerked her head sideways like one who understands. Meantime Razumov’s eyes had
                strayed after the two men. They were crossing the grass-plot obliquely, without
                haste. The shorter of the two was buttoned up in a narrow overcoat of some thin grey
                material, which came nearly to his heels. His companion, much taller and broader,
                wore a short, close-fitting jacket and tight trousers tucked into shabby
                top-boots.</p>

            <p>The woman, who had sent them out of Razumov’s way apparently, spoke in a businesslike
                voice.</p>

            <p>“I had to come rushing from Zurich on purpose to meet the train and take these two
                along here to see Peter Ivanovitch. I’ve just managed it.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! indeed,” Razumov said perfunctorily, and very vexed at her staying behind to
                talk to him “From Zurich — yes, of course. And these two, they come from . . .
                .”</p>

            <p>She interrupted, without emphasis —</p>

            <p>“From quite another direction. From a distance, too. A considerable distance.”</p>

            <p>Razumov shrugged his shoulders. The two men from a distance, after having reached the
                wall of the terrace, disappeared suddenly at its foot as if the earth had opened to
                swallow them up.</p>

            <p>“Oh, well, they have just come from America.” The woman in the crimson blouse
                shrugged her shoulders too a little before making that statement. “The time is
                drawing near,” she interjected, as if speaking to herself. “I did not tell them who
                you were. Yakovlitch would have wanted to embrace you.”</p>

            <p>“Is that he with the wisp of hair hanging from his chin, in the long coat?”</p>

            <p>“You’ve guessed aright. That’s Yakovlitch.”</p>

            <p>“And they could not find their way here from the station without you coming on
                purpose from Zurich to show it to them? Verily, without women we can do nothing. So
                it stands written, and apparently so it is.”</p>

            <p>He was conscious of an immense lassitude under his effort to be sarcastic. And he
                could see that she had detected it with those steady, brilliant black eyes.</p>

            <p>“What is the matter with you?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t know. Nothing. I’ve had a devil of a day.”</p>

            <p>She waited, with her black eyes fixed on his face. Then —</p>

            <p>“What of that? You men are so impressionable and self-conscious. One day is like
                another, hard, hard — and there’s an end of it, till the great day comes. I came
                over for a very good reason. They wrote to warn Peter Ivanovitch of their arrival.
                But where from? Only from Cherbourg on a bit of ship’s notepaper. Anybody could have
                done that. Yakovlitch has lived for years and years in America. I am the only one at
                hand who had known him well in the old days. I knew him very well indeed. So Peter
                Ivanovitch telegraphed, asking me to come. It’s natural enough, is it not?”</p>

            <p>“You came to vouch for his identity?” inquired Razumov.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Something of the kind. Fifteen years of a life like his make changes in a man.
                Lonely, like a crow in a strange country. When I think of Yakovlitch before he went
                to America —”</p>

            <p>The softness of the low tone caused Razumov to glance at her sideways. She sighed;
                her black eyes were looking away; she had plunged the fingers of her right hand deep
                into the mass of nearly white hair, and stirred them there absently. When she
                withdrew her hand the little hat perched on the top of her head remained slightly
                tilted, with a queer inquisitive effect, contrasting strongly with the reminiscent
                murmur that escaped her.</p>

            <p>“We were not in our first youth even then. But a man is a child always.”</p>

            <p>Razumov thought suddenly, “They have been living together.” Then aloud —</p>

            <p>“Why didn’t you follow him to America?” he asked point-blank.</p>

            <p>She looked up at him with a perturbed air.</p>

            <p>“Don’t you remember what was going on fifteen years ago? It was a time of activity.
                The Revolution has its history by this time. You are in it and yet you don’t seem to
                know it. Yakovlitch went away then on a mission; I went back to Russia. It had to be
                so. Afterwards there was nothing for him to come back to.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! indeed,” muttered Razumov, with affected surprise. “ Nothing!”</p>

            <p>“What are you trying to insinuate “ she exclaimed quickly. “ Well, and what then if
                he did get discouraged a little . . . .”</p>

            <p>“He looks like a Yankee, with that goatee hanging from his chin. A regular Uncle
                Sam,” growled Razumov. “Well, and you? You who went to Russia? You did not get
                discouraged.”</p>

            <p>“Never mind. Yakovlitch is a man who cannot be doubted. He, at any rate, is the right
                sort.”</p>

            <p>Her black, penetrating gaze remained fixed upon Razumov while she spoke, and for a
                moment afterwards.</p>

            <p>“Pardon me, “Razumov inquired coldly, “but does it mean that you, for instance, think
                that I am not the right sort?”</p>

            <p>She made no protest, gave no sign of having heard the question; she continued looking
                at him in a manner which he judged not to be absolutely unfriendly. In Zurich when
                he passed through she had taken him under her charge, in a way, and was with him
                from morning till night during his stay of two days. She took him round to see
                several people. At first she talked to him a great deal and rather unreservedly, but
                always avoiding all reference to herself; towards the middle of the second day she
                fell silent, attending him zealously as before, and even seeing him off at the
                railway station, where she pressed his hand firmly through the lowered carriage
                window, and, stepping back without a word, waited till the train moved. He had
                noticed that she was treated with quiet regard. He knew nothing of her parentage,
                nothing of her private history or political record; he judged her from his own
                private point of view, as being a distinct danger in his path. “Judged “ is not
                perhaps the right word. It was more of a feeling, the summing up of slight
                impressions aided by the discovery that he could not despise her as he despised all
                the others. He had not expected to see her again so soon.</p>

            <p>No, decidedly; her expression was not unfriendly. Yet he perceived an acceleration in
                the beat of his heart. The conversation could not be abandoned at that point. He
                went on in accents of scrupulous inquiry —</p>

            <p>“Is it perhaps because I don’t seem to accept blindly every development of the
                general doctrine — such for instance as the feminism of our great Peter Ivanovitch?
                If that is what makes me suspect, then I can only say I would scorn to be a slave
                even to an idea.”</p>

            <p>She had been looking at him all the time, not as a listener looks at one, but as if
                the words he chose to say were only of secondary interest. When he finished she
                slipped her hand, by a sudden and decided movement, under his arm and impelled him
                gently towards the gate of the grounds. He felt her firmness and obeyed the
                impulsion at once, just as the other two men had, a moment before, obeyed
                unquestioningly the wave of her hand.</p>

            <p>They made a few steps like this.</p>

            <p>“No, Razumov, your ideas are probably all right,” she said. “You may be valuable —
                very valuable. What’s the matter with you is that you don’t like us.”</p>

            <p>She released him. He met her with a frosty smile.</p>

            <p>“Am I expected then to have love as well as convictions?”</p>

            <p>She shrugged her shoulders.</p>

            <p>“You know very well what I mean. People have been thinking you not quite
                whole-hearted. I have heard that opinion from one side and another. But I have
                understood you at the end of the first day . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov interrupted her, speaking steadily.</p>

            <p>“I assure you that your perspicacity is at fault here.”</p>

            <p>“What phrases he uses!” she exclaimed parenthetically. “Ah! Kirylo Sidorovitch, you
                like other men are fastidious, full of self-love and afraid of trifles. Moreover,
                you had no training. What you want is to be taken in hand by some woman. I am sorry
                I am not staying here a few days. I am going back to Zurich to- morrow, and shall
                take Yakovlitch with me most likely.”</p>

            <p>This information relieved Razumov.</p>

            <p>“I am sorry too,” he said. “But, all the same, I don’t think you understand me.”</p>

            <p>He breathed more freely; she did not protest, but asked, “And how did you get on with
                Peter Ivanovitch? You have seen a good deal of each other. How is it between you
                two?”</p>

            <p>Not knowing what answer to make, the young man inclined his head slowly.</p>

            <p>Her lips had been parted in expectation. She pressed them together, and seemed to
                reflect.</p>

            <p>“That’s all right.”</p>

            <p>This had a sound of finality, but she did not leave him. It was impossible to guess
                what she had in her mind. Razumov muttered —</p>

            <p>“It is not of me that you should have asked that question. In a moment you shall see
                Peter Ivanovitch himself, and the subject will come up naturally. He will be curious
                to know what has delayed you so long in this garden.”</p>

            <p>“No doubt Peter Ivanovitch will have something to say to me. Several things. He may
                even speak of you — question me. Peter Ivanovitch is inclined to trust me
                generally.”</p>

            <p>“Question you? That’s very likely.”</p>

            <p>She smiled, half serious.</p>

            <p>“Well — and what shall I say to him?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t know. You may tell him of your discovery.”</p>

            <p>“What’s that?”</p>

            <p>“Why — my lack of love for . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Oh! That’s between ourselves,” she interrupted, it was hard to say whether in jest
                or earnest.</p>

            <p>“I see that you want to tell Peter Ivanovitch something in my favour,” said Razumov,
                with grim playfulness. “Well, then, you can tell him that I am very much in earnest
                about my mission. I mean to succeed.”</p>

            <p>“You have been given a mission!” she exclaimed quickly.</p>

            <p>“It amounts to that. I have been told to bring about a certain event.”</p>

            <p>She looked at him searchingly.</p>

            <p>“A mission,” she repeated, very grave and interested all at once. “What sort of
                mission?”</p>

            <p>“Something in the nature of propaganda work.”</p>

            <p>“Ah! Far away from here?”</p>

            <p>“No. Not very far,” said Razumov, restraining a sudden desire to laugh, although he
                did not feel joyous in the least.</p>

            <p>“So!” she said thoughtfully. “Well, I am not asking questions. It’s sufficient that
                Peter Ivanovitch should know what each of us is doing. Everything is bound to come
                right in the end.”</p>

            <p>“You think so?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t think, young man. I just simply believe it.”</p>

            <p>“And is it to Peter Ivanovitch that you owe that faith?”</p>

            <p>She did not answer the question, and they stood idle, silent, as if reluctant to part
                with each other.</p>

            <p>“That’s just like a man,” she murmured at last. “As if it were possible to tell how a
                belief comes to one.” Her thin Mephistophelian eyebrows moved a little. “Truly there
                are millions of people in Russia who would envy the life of dogs in this country. It
                is a horror and a shame to confess this even between ourselves. One must believe for
                very pity. This can’t go on. No! It can’t go on. For twenty years I have been coming
                and going, looking neither to the left nor to the right. . . . What are you smiling
                to yourself for? You are only at the beginning. You have begun well, but you just
                wait till you have trodden every particle of yourself under your feet in your
                comings and goings. For that is what it comes to. You’ve got to trample down every
                particle of your own feelings; for stop you cannot, you must not. I have been young,
                too — but perhaps you think that I am complaining-eh?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t think anything of the sort,” protested Razumov indifferently.</p>

            <p>“I dare say you don’t, you dear superior creature. You don’t care.”</p>

            <p>She plunged her fingers into the bunch of hair on the left side, and that brusque
                movement had the effect of setting the Tyrolese hat straight on her head. She
                frowned under it without animosity, in the manner of an investigator. Razumov
                averted his face carelessly.</p>

            <p>“You men are all alike. You mistake luck for merit. You do it in good faith too! I
                would not be too hard on you. It’s masculine nature. You men are ridiculously
                pitiful in your aptitude to cherish childish illusions down to the very grave. There
                are a lot of us who have been at work for fifteen years — I mean constantly — trying
                one way after another, underground and above ground, looking neither to the right
                nor to the left! I can talk about it. I have been one of these that never rested.
                . . . There! What’s the use of talking. . . . Look at my grey hairs! And here two
                babies come along — I mean you and Haldin — you come along and manage to strike a
                blow at the very first try.”</p>

            <p>At the name of Haldin falling from the rapid and energetic lips of the woman
                revolutionist, Razumov had the usual brusque consciousness of the irrevocable. But
                in all the months which had passed over his head he had become hardened to the
                experience. The consciousness was no longer accompanied by the blank dismay and the
                blind anger of the early days. He had argued himself into new beliefs; and he had
                made for himself a mental atmosphere of gloomy and sardonic reverie, a sort of murky
                medium through which the event appeared like a featureless shadow having vaguely the
                shape of a man; a shape extremely familiar, yet utterly inexpressive, except for its
                air of discreet waiting in the dusk. It was not alarming.</p>

            <p>“What was he like?” the woman revolutionist asked unexpectedly.</p>

            <p>“What was he like?” echoed Razumov, making a painful effort not to turn upon her
                savagely. But he relieved himself by laughing a little while he stole a glance at
                her out of the corners of his eyes. This reception of her inquiry disturbed her.</p>

            <p>“How like a woman,” he went on. “What is the good of concerning yourself with his
                appearance? Whatever it was, he is removed beyond all feminine influences now.”</p>

            <p>A frown, making three folds at the root of her nose, accentuated the Mephistophelian
                slant of her eyebrows.</p>

            <p>“You suffer, Razumov,” she suggested, in her low, confident voice.</p>

            <p>“What nonsense!” Razumov faced the woman fairly. “But now I think of it, I am not
                sure that he is beyond the influence of one woman at least; the one over there —
                Madame de S— — you know. Formerly the dead were allowed to rest, but now it seems
                they are at the beck and call of a crazy old harridan. We revolutionists make
                wonderful discoveries. It is true that they are not exactly our own. We have nothing
                of our own. But couldn’t the friend of Peter Ivanovitch satisfy your feminine
                curiosity? Couldn’t she conjure him up for you?”— he jested like a man in pain.</p>

            <p>Her concentrated frowning expression relaxed, and she said, a little wearily, “Let us
                hope she will make an effort and conjure up some tea for us. But that is by no means
                certain. I am tired, Razumov.”</p>

            <p>“You tired! What a confession! Well, there has been tea up there. I had some. If you
                hurry on after Yakovlitch, instead of wasting your time with such an unsatisfactory
                sceptical person as myself, you may find the ghost of it — the cold ghost of it —
                still lingering in the temple. But as to you being tired I can hardly believe it. We
                are not supposed to be. We mustn’t, We can’t. The other day I read in some paper or
                other an alarmist article on the tireless activity of the revolutionary parties. It
                impresses the world. It’s our prestige.”</p>

            <p>“He flings out continually these flouts and sneers;” the woman in the crimson blouse
                spoke as if appealing quietly to a third person, but her black eyes never left
                Razumov’s face. “And what for, pray? Simply because some of his conventional notions
                are shocked, some of his petty masculine standards. You might think he was one of
                these nervous sensitives that come to a bad end. And yet,” she went on, after a
                short, reflective pause and changing the mode of her address, “and yet I have just
                learned something which makes me think that you are a man of character, Kirylo
                Sidorovitch. Yes! indeed — you are.”</p>

            <p>The mysterious positiveness of this assertion startled Razumov. Their eyes met. He
                looked away and, through the bars of the rusty gate, stared at the clean, wide road
                shaded by the leafy trees. An electric tramcar, quite empty, ran along the avenue
                with a metallic rustle. It seemed to him he would have given anything to be sitting
                inside all alone. He was inexpressibly weary, weary in every fibre of his body, but
                he had a reason for not being the first to break off the conversation. At any
                instant, in the visionary and criminal babble of revolutionists, some momentous
                words might fall on his ear; from her lips, from anybody’s lips. As long as he
                managed to preserve a clear mind and to keep down his irritability there was nothing
                to fear. The only condition of success and safety was indomitable will-power, he
                reminded himself.</p>

            <p>He longed to be on the other side of the bars, as though he were actually a prisoner
                within the grounds of this centre of revolutionary plots, of this house of folly, of
                blindness, of villainy and crime. Silently he indulged his wounded spirit in a
                feeling of immense moral and mental remoteness. He did not even smile when he heard
                her repeat the words —</p>

            <p>“Yes! A strong character.”</p>

            <p>He continued to gaze through the bars like a moody prisoner, not thinking of escape,
                but merely pondering upon the faded memories of freedom.</p>

            <p>“If you don’t look out,” he mumbled, still looking away, “you shall certainly miss
                seeing as much as the mere ghost of that tea.”</p>

            <p>She was not to be shaken off in such a way. As a matter of fact he had not expected
                to succeed.</p>

            <p>“Never mind, it will be no great loss. I mean the missing of her tea and only the
                ghost of it at that. As to the lady, you must understand that she has her positive
                uses. See <hi>that</hi>, Razumov.”</p>

            <p>He turned his head at this imperative appeal and saw the woman revolutionist making
                the motions of counting money into the palm of her hand.</p>

            <p>“That’s what it is. You see?”</p>

            <p>Razumov uttered a slow “I see,” and returned to his prisoner-like gazing upon the
                neat and shady road.</p>

            <p>“Material means must be obtained in some way, and this is easier than breaking into
                banks. More certain too. There! I am joking. . . . What is he muttering to himself
                now?” she cried under her breath.</p>

            <p>“My admiration of Peter Ivanovitch’s devoted self-sacrifice, that’s all. It’s enough
                to make one sick.”</p>

            <p>“Oh, you squeamish, masculine creature. Sick! Makes him sick! And what do you know of
                the truth of it? There’s no looking into the secrets of the heart. Peter Ivanovitch
                knew her years ago, in his worldly days, when he was a young officer in the Guards.
                It is not for us to judge an inspired person. That’s where you men have an
                advantage. You are inspired sometimes both in thought and action. I have always
                admitted that when you <hi>are</hi> inspired, when you manage to throw off your
                masculine cowardice and prudishness you are not to be equalled by us. Only, how
                seldom. . . . Whereas the silliest woman can always be made of use. And why? Because
                we have passion, unappeasable passion. . . . I should like to know what he is
                smiling at?”</p>

            <p>“I am not smiling,” protested Razumov gloomily.</p>

            <p>“Well! How is one to call it? You made some sort of face. Yes, I know! You men can
                love here and hate there and desire something or other — and you make a great to-do
                about it, and you call it passion! Yes! While it lasts. But we women are in love
                with love, and with hate, with these very things I tell you, and with desire itself.
                That’s why we can’t be bribed off so easily as you men. In life, you see, there is
                not much choice. You have either to rot or to burn. And there is not one of us,
                painted or unpainted, that would not rather burn than rot.”</p>

            <p>She spoke with energy, but in a matter-of-fact tone. Razumov’s attention had wandered
                away on a track of its own — outside the bars of the gate- -but not out of earshot.
                He stuck his hands into the pockets of his coat.</p>

            <p>“Rot or burn! Powerfully stated. Painted or unpainted. Very vigorous. Painted or.
                . . . Do tell me — she would be infernally jealous of him, wouldn’t she?”</p>

            <p>“Who? What? The Baroness? Eleanor Maximovna? Jealous of Peter Ivanovitch? Heavens!
                Are these the questions the man’s mind is running on? Such a thing is not to be
                thought of.”</p>

            <p>“Why? Can’t a wealthy old woman be jealous? Or, are they all pure spirits
                together?”</p>

            <p>“But what put it into your head to ask such a question?” she wondered.</p>

            <p>“Nothing. I just asked. Masculine frivolity, if you like.”</p>

            <p>“I don’t like,” she retorted at once. “It is not the time to be frivolous. What are
                you flinging your very heart against? Or, perhaps, you are only playing a part.”</p>

            <p>Razumov had felt that woman’s observation of him like a physical contact, like a hand
                resting lightly on his shoulder. At that moment he received the mysterious
                impression of her having made up her mind for a closer grip. He stiffened himself
                inwardly to bear it without betraying himself.</p>

            <p>“Playing a Part,” he repeated, presenting to her an unmoved profile. “It must be done
                very badly since you see through the assumption.”</p>

            <p>She watched him, her forehead drawn into perpendicular folds, the thin black eyebrows
                diverging upwards like the antennae of an insect. He added hardly audibly —</p>

            <p>“You are mistaken. I am doing it no more than the rest of us.”</p>

            <p>“Who is doing it?” she snapped out.</p>

            <p>“Who? Everybody,” he said impatiently. “You are a materialist, aren’t you?”</p>

            <p>“Eh! My dear soul, I have outlived all that nonsense.”</p>

            <p>“But you must remember the definition of Cabanis: ‘Man is a digestive tube.’ I
                imagine now . . . .”</p>

            <p>“I spit on him.”</p>

            <p>“What? On Cabanis? All right. But you can’t ignore the importance of a good
                digestion. The joy of life — you know the joy of life? — depends on a sound stomach,
                whereas a bad digestion inclines one to scepticism, breeds black fancies and
                thoughts of death. These are facts ascertained by physiologists. Well, I assure you
                that ever since I came over from Russia I have been stuffed with indigestible
                foreign concoctions of the most nauseating kind — pah!”</p>

            <p>“You are joking,” she murmured incredulously. He assented in a detached way.</p>

            <p>“Yes. It is all a joke. It’s hardly worth while talking to a man like me. Yet for
                that very reason men have been known to take their own life.”</p>

            <p>“On the contrary, I think it is worth while talking to you.”</p>

            <p>He kept her in the corner of his eye. She seemed to be thinking out some scathing
                retort, but ended by only shrugging her shoulders slightly.</p>

            <p>“Shallow talk! I suppose one must pardon this weakness in you,” she said, putting a
                special accent on the last word. There was something anxious in her indulgent
                conclusion.</p>

            <p>Razumov noted the slightest shades in this conversation, which he had not expected,
                for which he was not prepared. That was it. “I was not prepared,” he said to
                himself. “It has taken me unawares.” It seemed to him that if he only could allow
                himself to pant openly like a dog for a time this oppression would pass away. “I
                shall never be found prepared,” he thought, with despair. He laughed a little,
                saying as lightly as he could —</p>

            <p>“Thanks. I don’t ask for mercy.” Then affecting a playful uneasiness, “But aren’t you
                afraid Peter Ivanovitch might suspect us of plotting something unauthorized together
                by the gate here?”</p>

            <p>“No, I am not afraid. You are quite safe from suspicions while you are with me, my
                dear young man.” The humorous gleam in her black eyes went out. “Peter Ivanovitch
                trusts me,” she went on, quite austerely. “He takes my advice. I am his right hand,
                as it were, in certain most important things. . . . That amuses you what? Do you
                think I am boasting?”</p>

            <p>“God forbid. I was just only saying to myself that Peter Ivanovitch seems to have
                solved the woman question pretty completely.”</p>

            <p>Even as he spoke he reproached himself for his words, for his tone. All day long he
                had been saying the wrong things. It was folly, worse than folly. It was weakness;
                it was this disease of perversity overcoming his will. Was this the way to meet
                speeches which certainly contained the promise of future confidences from that woman
                who apparently had a great store of secret knowledge and so much influence? Why give
                her this puzzling impression? But she did not seem inimical. There was no anger in
                her voice. It was strangely speculative.</p>

            <p>“One does not know what to think, Razumov. You must have bitten something bitter in
                your cradle.” Razumov gave her a sidelong glance.</p>

            <p>“H’m! Something bitter? That’s an explanation,” he muttered. “Only it was much later.
                And don’t you think, Sophia Antonovna, that you and I come from the same
                cradle?”</p>

            <p>The woman, whose name he had forced himself at last to pronounce (he had experienced
                a strong repugnance in letting it pass his lips), the woman revolutionist murmured,
                after a pause —</p>

            <p>“You mean — Russia?”</p>

            <p>He disdained even to nod. She seemed softened, her black eyes very still, as though
                she were pursuing the simile in her thoughts to all its tender associations. But
                suddenly she knitted her brows in a Mephistophelian frown.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Perhaps no wonder, then. Yes. One lies there lapped up in evils, watched over
                by beings that are worse than ogres, ghouls, and vampires. They must be driven away,
                destroyed utterly. In regard of that task nothing else matters if men and women are
                determined and faithful. That’s how I came to feel in the end. The great thing is
                not to quarrel amongst ourselves about all sorts of conventional trifles. Remember
                that, Razumov.”</p>

            <p>Razumov was not listening. He had even lost the sense of being watched in a sort of
                heavy tranquillity. His uneasiness, his exasperation, his scorn were blunted at last
                by all these trying hours. It seemed to him that now they were blunted for ever. “I
                am a match for them all,” he thought, with a conviction too firm to be exulting. The
                woman revolutionist had ceased speaking; he was not looking at her; there was no one
                passing along the road. He almost forgot that he was not alone. He heard her voice
                again, curt, businesslike, and yet betraying the hesitation which had been the real
                reason of her prolonged silence.</p>

            <p>“I say, Razumov!”</p>

            <p>Razumov, whose face was turned away from her, made a grimace like a man who hears a
                false note.</p>

            <p>“Tell me: is it true that on the very morning of the deed you actually attended the
                lectures at the University?”</p>

            <p>An appreciable fraction of a second elapsed before the real import of the question
                reached him, like a bullet which strikes some time after the flash of the fired
                shot. Luckily his disengaged hand was ready to grip a bar of the gate. He held it
                with a terrible force, but his presence of mind was gone. He could make only a sort
                of gurgling, grumpy sound.</p>

            <p>“Come, Kirylo Sidorovitch!” she urged him. “I know you are not a boastful man.
                    <hi>That</hi> one must say for you. You are a silent man. Too silent, perhaps.
                You are feeding on some bitterness of your own. You are not an enthusiast. You are,
                perhaps, all the stronger for that. But you might tell me. One would like to
                understand you a little more. I was so immensely struck. . . . Have you really done
                it?”</p>

            <p>He got his voice back. The shot had missed him. It had been fired at random,
                altogether, more like a signal for coming to close quarters. It was to be a plain
                struggle for self- preservation. And she was a dangerous adversary too. But he was
                ready for battle; he was so ready that when he turned towards her not a muscle of
                his face moved.</p>

            <p>“Certainly,” he said, without animation, secretly strung up but perfectly sure of
                himself. “Lectures — certainly, But what makes you ask?”</p>

            <p>It was she who was animated.</p>

            <p>“I had it in a letter, written by a young man in Petersburg; one of us, of course.
                You were seen- -you were observed with your notebook, impassible, taking notes . . .
                .”</p>

            <p>He enveloped her with his fixed stare.</p>

            <p>“What of that?”</p>

            <p>“I call such coolness superb — that’s all. It is a proof of uncommon strength of
                character. The young man writes that nobody could have guessed from your face and
                manner the part you had played only some two hours before — the great, momentous,
                glorious part . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Oh no. Nobody could have guessed,” assented Razumov gravely, “because, don’t you
                see, nobody at that time . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes, yes. But all the same you are a man of exceptional fortitude, it seems. You
                looked exactly as usual. It was remembered afterwards with wonder . . . .”</p>

            <p>“It cost me no effort,” Razumov declared, with the same staring gravity.</p>

            <p>“Then it’s almost more wonderful still!” she exclaimed, and fell silent while Razumov
                asked himself whether he had not said there something utterly unnecessary — or even
                worse.</p>

            <p>She raised her head eagerly.</p>

            <p>“Your intention was to stay in Russia? You had planned . . . .”</p>

            <p>“No,” interrupted Razumov without haste. “I had made no plans of any sort.”</p>

            <p>“You just simply walked away?” she struck in.</p>

            <p>He bowed his head in slow assent. “Simply — yes.” He had gradually released his hold
                on the bar of the gate, as though he had acquired the conviction that no random shot
                could knock him over now. And suddenly he was inspired to add, “The snow was coming
                down very thick, you know.”</p>

            <p>She had a slight appreciative movement of the head, like an expert in such
                enterprises, very interested, capable of taking every point professionally. Razumov
                remembered something he had heard.</p>

            <p>“I turned into a narrow side street, you understand,” he went on negligently, and
                paused as if it were not worth talking about. Then he remembered another detail and
                dropped it before her, like a disdainful dole to her curiosity.</p>

            <p>“I felt inclined to lie down and go to sleep there.”</p>

            <p>She clicked her tongue at that symptom, very struck indeed. Then —</p>

            <p>“But the notebook! The amazing notebook, man. You don’t mean to say you had put it in
                your pocket beforehand!” she cried.</p>

            <p>Razumov gave a start. It might have been a sign of impatience.</p>

            <p>“I went home. Straight home to my rooms,” he said distinctly.</p>

            <p>“The coolness of the man! You dared?”</p>

            <p>“Why not? I assure you I was perfectly calm. Ha! Calmer than I am now perhaps.”</p>

            <p>“I like you much better as you are now than when you indulge that bitter vein of
                yours, Razumov. And nobody in the house saw you return — eh? That might have
                appeared queer.”</p>

            <p>“No one,” Razumov said firmly. “Dvornik, landlady, girl, all out of the way. I went
                up like a shadow. It was a murky morning. The stairs were dark. I glided up like a
                phantom. Fate? Luck? What do you think?”</p>

            <p>“I just see it!” The eyes of the woman revolutionist snapped darkly. “Well — and then
                you considered . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov had it all ready in his head.</p>

            <p>“No. I looked at my watch, since you want to know. There was just time. I took that
                notebook, and ran down the stairs on tiptoe. Have you ever listened to the pit-pat
                of a man running round and round the shaft of a deep staircase? They have a gaslight
                at the bottom burning night and day. I suppose it’s gleaming down there now. . . .
                The sound dies out — the flame winks . . . .”</p>

            <p>He noticed the vacillation of surprise passing over the steady curiosity of the black
                eyes fastened on his face as if the woman revolutionist received the sound of his
                voice into her pupils instead of her ears. He checked himself, passed his hand over
                his forehead, confused, like a man who has been dreaming aloud.</p>

            <p>“Where could a student be running if not to his lectures in the morning? At night
                it’s another matter. I did not care if all the house had been there to look at me.
                But I don’t suppose there was anyone. It’s best not to be seen or heard. Aha! The
                people that are neither seen nor heard are the lucky ones — in Russia. Don’t you
                admire my luck?”</p>

            <p>“Astonishing,” she said. “If you have luck as well as determination, then indeed you
                are likely to turn out an invaluable acquisition for the work in hand.”</p>

            <p>Her tone was earnest; and it seemed to Razumov that it was speculative, even as
                though she were already apportioning him, in her mind, his share of the work. Her
                eyes were cast down. He waited, not very alert now, but with the grip of the
                ever-present danger giving him an air of attentive gravity. Who could have written
                about him in that letter from Petersburg? A fellow student, surely — some imbecile
                victim of revolutionary propaganda, some foolish slave of foreign, subversive
                ideals. A long, famine- stricken, red-nosed figure presented itself to his mental
                search. That must have been the fellow!</p>

            <p>He smiled inwardly at the absolute wrong- headedness of the whole thing, the self-
                deception of a criminal idealist shattering his existence like a thunder-clap out of
                a clear sky, and re-echoing amongst the wreckage in the false assumptions of those
                other fools. Fancy that hungry and piteous imbecile furnishing to the curiosity of
                the revolutionist refugees this utterly fantastic detail! He appreciated it as by no
                means constituting a danger. On the contrary. As things stood it was for his
                advantage rather, a piece of sinister luck which had only to be accepted with proper
                caution.</p>

            <p>“And yet, Razumov,” he heard the musing voice of the woman, “you have not the face of
                a lucky man.” She raised her eyes with renewed interest. “And so that was the way of
                it. After doing your work you simply walked off and made for your rooms. That sort
                of thing succeeds sometimes. I suppose it was agreed beforehand that, once the
                business over, each of you would go his own way?”</p>

            <p>Razumov preserved the seriousness of his expression and the deliberate, if cautious,
                manner of speaking.</p>

            <p>“Was not that the best thing to do?” he asked, in a dispassionate tone. “And anyway,”
                he added, after waiting a moment, “ we did not give much thought to what would come
                after. We never discussed formally any line of conduct. It was understood, I
                think.”</p>

            <p>She approved his statement with slight nods.</p>

            <p>“You, of course, wished to remain in Russia?”</p>

            <p>“In St. Petersburg itself,” emphasized Razumov. “It was the only safe course for me.
                And, moreover, I had nowhere else to go.”</p>

            <p>“Yes! Yes! I know. Clearly. And the other — this wonderful Haldin appearing only to
                be regretted — you don’t know what he intended?”</p>

            <p>Razumov had foreseen that such a question would certainly come to meet him sooner or
                later. He raised his hands a little and let them fall helplessly by his side —
                nothing more.</p>

            <p>It was the white-haired woman conspirator who was the first to break the silence.</p>

            <p>“Very curious,” she pronounced slowly. “And you did not think, Kirylo Sidorovitch,
                that he might perhaps wish to get in touch with you again?”</p>

            <p>Razumov discovered that he could not suppress the trembling of his lips. But he
                thought that he owed it to himself to speak. A negative sign would not do again.
                Speak he must, if only to get at the bottom of what that St. Petersburg letter might
                have contained.</p>

            <p>“I stayed at home next day,” he said, bending down a little and plunging his glance
                into the black eyes of the woman so that she should not observe the trembling of his
                lips. “Yes, I stayed at home. As my actions are remembered and written about, then
                perhaps you are aware that I was <hi>not</hi> seen at the lectures next day. Eh? You
                didn’t know? Well, I stopped at home-the live-long day.”</p>

            <p>As if moved by his agitated tone, she murmured a sympathetic “I see! It must have
                been trying enough.”</p>

            <p>“You seem to understand one’s feelings,” said Razumov steadily. “It was trying. It
                was horrible; it was an atrocious day. It was not the last.”</p>

            <p>“Yes, I understand. Afterwards, when you heard they had got him. Don’t I know how one
                feels after losing a comrade in the good fight? One’s ashamed of being left. And I
                can remember so many. Never mind. They shall be avenged before long. And what is
                death? At any rate, it is not a shameful thing like some kinds of life.”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt something stir in his breast, a sort of feeble and unpleasant
                tremor.</p>

            <p>“Some kinds of life?” he repeated, looking at her searchingly.</p>

            <p>“The subservient, submissive life. Life? No! Vegetation on the filthy heap of
                iniquity which the world is. Life, Razumov, not to be vile must be a revolt — a
                pitiless protest — all the time.”</p>

            <p>She calmed down, the gleam of suffused tears in her eyes dried out instantly by the
                heat of her passion, and it was in her capable, businesslike manner that she went
                on —</p>

            <p>“You understand me, Razumov. You are not an enthusiast, but there is an immense force
                of revolt in you. I felt it from the first, directly I set my eyes on you — you
                remember — in Zurich. Oh! You are full of bitter revolt. That is good. Indignation
                flags sometimes, revenge itself may become a weariness, but that uncompromising
                sense of necessity and justice which armed your and Haldin’s hands to strike down
                that fanatical brute . . . for it was that — nothing but that! I have been thinking
                it out. It could have been nothing else but that.”</p>

            <p>Razumov made a slight bow, the irony of which was concealed by an almost sinister
                immobility of feature.</p>

            <p>“I can’t speak for the dead. As for myself, I can assure you that my conduct was
                dictated by necessity and by the sense of — well — retributive justice.”</p>

            <p>“Good, that,” he said to himself, while her eyes rested upon him, black and
                impenetrable like the mental caverns where revolutionary thought should sit plotting
                the violent way of its dream of changes. As if anything could be changed! In this
                world of men nothing can be changed — neither happiness nor misery. They can only be
                displaced at the cost of corrupted consciences and broken lives — a futile game for
                arrogant philosophers and sanguinary triflers. Those thoughts darted through
                Razumov’s head while he stood facing the old revolutionary hand, the respected,
                trusted, and influential Sophia Antonovna, whose word had such a weight in the
                “active” section of every party. She was much more representative than the great
                Peter Ivanovitch. Stripped of rhetoric, mysticism, and theories, she was the true
                spirit of destructive revolution. And she was the personal adversary he had to meet.
                It gave him a feeling of triumphant pleasure to deceive her out of her own mouth.
                The epigrammatic saying that speech has been given to us for the purpose of
                concealing our thoughts came into his mind. Of that cynical theory this was a very
                subtle and a very scornful application, flouting in its own words the very spirit of
                ruthless revolution, embodied in that woman with her white hair and black eyebrows,
                like slightly sinuous lines of Indian ink, drawn together by the perpendicular folds
                of a thoughtful frown.</p>

            <p>“That’s it. Retributive. No pity!” was the conclusion of her silence. And this once
                broken, she went on impulsively in short, vibrating sentences —</p>

            <p>“Listen to my story, Razumov! . . .” Her father was a clever but unlucky artisan. No
                joy had lighted up his laborious days. He died at fifty; all the years of his life
                he had panted under the thumb of masters whose rapacity exacted from him the price
                of the water, of the salt, of the very air he breathed; taxed the sweat of his brow
                and claimed the blood of his sons. No protection, no guidance! What had society to
                say to him? Be submissive and be honest. If you rebel I shall kill you. If you steal
                I shall imprison you. But if you suffer I have nothing for you — nothing except
                perhaps a beggarly dole of bread — but no consolation for your trouble, no respect
                for your manhood, no pity for the sorrows of your miserable life.</p>

            <p>And so he laboured, he suffered, and he died. He died in the hospital. Standing by
                the common grave she thought of his tormented existence — she saw it whole. She
                reckoned the simple joys of life, the birthright of the humblest, of which his
                gentle heart had been robbed by the crime of a society which nothing can
                absolve.</p>

            <p>“Yes, Razumov,” she continued, in an impressive, lowered voice, “it was like a lurid
                light in which I stood, still almost a child, and cursed not the toil, not the
                misery which had been his lot, but the great social iniquity of the system resting
                on unrequited toil and unpitied sufferings. From that moment I was a
                revolutionist.”</p>

            <p>Razumov, trying to raise himself above the dangerous weaknesses of contempt or
                compassion, had preserved an impassive countenance. She, with an unaffected touch of
                mere bitterness, the first he could notice since he had come in contact with the
                woman, went on —</p>

            <p>“As I could not go to the Church where the priests of the system exhorted such
                unconsidered vermin as I to resignation, I went to the secret societies as soon as I
                knew how to find my way. I was sixteen years old — no more, Razumov! And — look at
                my white hair.”</p>

            <p>In these last words there was neither pride nor sadness. The bitterness too was
                gone.</p>

            <p>“There is a lot of it. I had always magnificent hair, even as a chit of a girl. Only,
                at that time we were cutting it short and thinking that there was the first step
                towards crushing the social infamy. Crush the Infamy! A fine watchword! I would
                placard it on the walls of prisons and palaces, carve it on hard rocks, hang it out
                in letters of fire on that empty sky for a sign of hope and terror — a portent of
                the end . . . .”</p>

            <p>“You are eloquent, Sophia Antonovna,” Razumov interrupted suddenly. “Only, so far you
                seem to have been writing it in water . . . .”</p>

            <p>She was checked but not offended. “Who knows? Very soon it may become a fact written
                all over that great land of ours,” she hinted meaningly. “And then one would have
                lived long enough. White hair won’t matter.”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked at her white hair: and this mark of so many uneasy years seemed
                nothing but a testimony to the invincible vigour of revolt. It threw out into an
                astonishing relief the unwrinkled face, the brilliant black glance, the upright
                compact figure, the simple, brisk self-possession of the mature personality — as
                though in her revolutionary pilgrimage she had discovered the secret, not of
                everlasting youth, but of everlasting endurance.</p>

            <p>How un-Russian she looked, thought Razumov. Her mother might have been a Jewess or an
                Armenian or devil knew what. He reflected that a revolutionist is seldom true to the
                settled type. All revolt is the expression of strong individualism — ran his thought
                vaguely. One can tell them a mile off in any society, in any surroundings. It was
                astonishing that the police . . . .</p>

            <p>“We shall not meet again very soon, I think,” she was saying. “I am leaving
                to-morrow.”</p>

            <p>“For Zurich?” Razumov asked casually, but feeling relieved, not from any distinct
                apprehension, but from a feeling of stress as if after a wrestling match.</p>

            <p>“Yes, Zurich — and farther on, perhaps, much farther. Another journey. When I think
                of all my journeys! The last must come some day. Never mind, Razumov. We had to have
                a good long talk. I would have certainly tried to see you if we had not met. Peter
                Ivanovitch knows where you live? Yes. I meant to have asked him — but it’s better
                like this. You see, we expect two more men; and I had much rather wait here talking
                with you than up there at the house with . . . .”</p>

            <p>Having cast a glance beyond the gate, she interrupted herself. “Here they are,” she
                said rapidly. “Well, Kirylo Sidorovitch, we shall have to say good-bye,
                presently.”</p>

        <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="chapter">

            <head>4</head>


            <p>In his incertitude of the ground on which he stood Razumov felt perturbed. Turning
                his head quickly, he saw two men on the opposite side of the road. Seeing themselves
                noticed by Sophia Antonovna, they crossed over at once, and passed one after another
                through the little gate by the side of the empty lodge. They looked hard at the
                stranger, but without mistrust, the crimson blouse being a flaring safety signal.
                The first, great white hairless face, double chin, prominent stomach, which he
                seemed to carry forward consciously within a strongly distended overcoat, only
                nodded and averted his eyes peevishly; his companion — lean, flushed cheekbones, a
                military red moustache below a sharp, salient nose — approached at once Sophia
                Antonovna, greeting her warmly. His voice was very strong but inarticulate. It
                sounded like a deep buzzing. The woman revolutionist was quietly cordial.</p>

            <p>“This is Razumov,” she announced in a clear voice.</p>

            <p>The lean new-comer made an eager half-turn. “He will want to embrace me,” thought our
                young man with a deep recoil of all his being, while his limbs seemed too heavy to
                move. But it was a groundless alarm. He had to do now with a generation of
                conspirators who did not kiss each other on both cheeks; and raising an arm that
                felt like lead he dropped his hand into a largely-outstretched palm, fleshless and
                hot as if dried up by fever, giving a bony pressure, expressive, seeming to say,
                “Between us there’s no need of words.” The man had big, wide-open eyes. Razumov
                fancied he could see a smile behind their sadness.</p>

            <p>“This is Razumov,” Sophia Antonovna repeated loudly for the benefit of the fat man,
                who at some distance displayed the profile of his stomach.</p>

            <p>No one moved. Everything, sounds, attitudes, movements, and immobility seemed to be
                part of an experiment, the result of which was a thin voice piping with comic
                peevishness —</p>

            <p>“Oh yes! Razumov. We have been hearing of nothing but Mr. Razumov for months. For my
                part, I confess I would rather have seen Haldin on this spot instead of Mr.
                Razumov.”</p>

            <p>The squeaky stress put on the name “Razumov — Mr. Razumov” pierced the ear
                ridiculously, like the falsetto of a circus clown beginning an elaborate joke.
                Astonishment was Razumov’s first response, followed by sudden indignation.</p>

            <p>“What’s the meaning of this?” he asked in a stern tone.</p>

            <p>“Tut! Silliness. He’s always like that.” Sophia Antonovna was obviously vexed. But
                she dropped the information, “Necator,” from her lips just loud enough to be heard
                by Razumov. The abrupt squeaks of the fat man seemed to proceed from that thing like
                a balloon he carried under his overcoat. The stolidity of his attitude, the big
                feet, the lifeless, hanging hands, the enormous bloodless cheek, the thin wisps of
                hair straggling down the fat nape of the neck, fascinated Razumov into a stare on
                the verge of horror and laughter.</p>

            <p>Nikita, surnamed Necator, with a sinister aptness of alliteration! Razumov had heard
                of him. He had heard so much since crossing the frontier of these celebrities of the
                militant revolution; the legends, the stories, the authentic chronicle, which now
                and then peeps out before a half-incredulous world. Razumov had heard of him. He was
                supposed to have killed more, gendarmes and police agents than any revolutionist
                living. He had been entrusted with executions.</p>

            <p>The paper with the letters N.N., the very pseudonym of murder, found pinned on the
                stabbed breast of a certain notorious spy (this picturesque detail of a sensational
                murder case had got into the newspapers), was the mark of his handiwork. “By order
                of the Committee. — N.N.” A corner of the curtain lifted to strike the imagination
                of the gaping world. He was said to have been innumerable times in and out of
                Russia, the Necator of bureaucrats, of provincial governors, of obscure informers.
                He lived between whiles, Razumov had heard, on the shores of the Lake of Como, with
                a charming wife, devoted to the cause, and two young children. But how could that
                creature, so grotesque as to set town dogs barking at its mere sight, go about on
                those deadly errands and slip through the meshes of the police?”</p>

            <p>“What now? what now?” the voice squeaked. “I am only sincere. It’s not denied that
                the other was the leading spirit. Well, it would have been better if he had been the
                one spared to us. More useful. I am not a sentimentalist. Say what I think . . .
                only natural.”</p>

            <p>Squeak, squeak, squeak, without a gesture, without a stir — the horrible squeaky
                burlesque of professional jealousy — this man of a sinister alliterative nickname,
                this executioner of revolutionary verdicts, the terrifying N.N. exasperated like a
                fashionable tenor by the attention attracted to the performance of an obscure
                amateur. Sophia Antonovna shrugged her shoulders. The comrade with the martial red
                moustache hurried towards Razumov full of conciliatory intentions in his strong
                buzzing voice.</p>

            <p>“Devil take it! And in this place, too, in the public street, so to speak. But you
                can see yourself how it is. One of his fantastic sallies. Absolutely of no
                consequence.”</p>

            <p>“Pray don’t concern yourself,” cried Razumov, going off into a long fit of laughter.
                “Don’t mention it.”</p>

            <p>The other, his hectic flush like a pair of burns on his cheek-bones, stared for a
                moment and burst out laughing too. Razumov, whose hilarity died out all at once,
                made a step forward.</p>

            <p>“Enough of this,” he began in a clear, incisive voice, though he could hardly control
                the trembling of his legs. “I will have no more of it. I shall not permit anyone.
                . . . I can see very well what you are at with those allusions . . . . Inquire,
                investigate! I defy you, but I will not be played with.”</p>

            <p>He had spoken such words before. He had been driven to cry them out in the face of
                other suspicions. It was an infernal cycle bringing round that protest like a fatal
                necessity of his existence. But it was no use. He would be always played with.
                Luckily life does not last for ever.</p>

            <p>“I won’t have it!” he shouted, striking his fist into the palm of his other hand.</p>

            <p>“Kirylo Sidorovitch — what has come to you?” The woman revolutionist interfered with
                authority. They were all looking at Razumov now; the slayer of spies and gendarmes
                had turned about, presenting his enormous stomach in full, like a shield.</p>

            <p>“Don’t shout. There are people passing.” Sophia Antonovna was apprehensive of another
                outburst. A steam-launch from Monrepos had come to the landing-stage opposite the
                gate, its hoarse whistle and the churning noise alongside all unnoticed, had landed
                a small bunch of local passengers who were dispersing their several ways. Only a
                specimen of early tourist in knickerbockers, conspicuous by a brand-new yellow
                leather glass-case, hung about for a moment, scenting something unusual about these
                four people within the rusty iron gates of what looked the grounds run wild of an
                unoccupied private house. Ah! If he had only known what the chance of commonplace
                travelling had suddenly put in his way! But he was a well-bred person; he averted
                his gaze and moved off with short steps along the avenue, on the watch for a
                tramcar.</p>

            <p>A gesture from Sophia Antonovna, “Leave him to me,” had sent the two men away — the
                buzzing of the inarticulate voice growing fainter and fainter, and the thin pipe of
                “What now? what’s the matter?” reduced to the proportions of a squeaking toy by the
                distance. They had left him to her. So many things could be left safely to the
                experience of Sophia Antonovna. And at once, her black eyes turned to Razumov, her
                mind tried to get at the heart of that outburst. It had some meaning. No one is born
                an active revolutionist. The change comes disturbingly, with the force of a sudden
                vocation, bringing in its train agonizing doubts, assertive violences, an unstable
                state of the soul, till the final appeasement of the convert in the perfect
                fierceness of conviction. She had seen — often had only divined — scores of these
                young men and young women going through an emotional crisis. This young man looked
                like a moody egotist. And besides, it was a special — a unique case. She had never
                met an individuality which interested and puzzled her so much.</p>

            <p>“Take care, Razumov, my good friend. If you carry on like this you will go mad. You
                are angry with everybody and bitter with yourself, and on the look out for something
                to torment yourself with.”</p>

            <p>“It’s intolerable!” Razumov could only speak in gasps. “ You must admit that I can
                have no illusions on the attitude which . . . it isn’t clear . . . or rather only
                too clear.”</p>

            <p>He made a gesture of despair. It was not his courage that failed him. The choking
                fumes of falsehood had taken him by the throat — the thought of being condemned to
                struggle on and on in that tainted atmosphere without the hope of ever renewing his
                strength by a breath of fresh air.</p>

            <p>“A glass of cold water is what you want.” Sophia Antonovna glanced up the grounds at
                the house and shook her head, then out of the gate at the brimful placidity of the
                lake. With a half-comical shrug of the shoulders, she gave the remedy up in the face
                of that abundance.</p>

            <p>“It is you, my dear soul, who are flinging yourself at something which does not
                exist. What is it? Self-reproach, or what? It’s absurd. You couldn’t have gone and
                given yourself up because your comrade was taken.”</p>

            <p>She remonstrated with him reasonably, at some length too. He had nothing to complain
                of in his reception. Every new-comer was discussed more or less. Everybody had to be
                thoroughly understood before being accepted. No one that she could remember had been
                shown from the first so much confidence. Soon, very soon, perhaps sooner than he
                expected, he would be given an opportunity of showing his devotion to the sacred
                task of crushing the Infamy.</p>

            <p>Razumov, listening quietly, thought: “It may be that she is trying to lull my
                suspicions to sleep. On the other hand, it is obvious that most of them are fools.”
                He moved aside a couple of paces and, folding his arms on his breast, leaned back
                against the stone pillar of the gate.</p>

            <p>“As to what remains obscure in the fate of that poor Haldin,” Sophia Antonovna
                dropped into a slowness of utterance which was to Razumov like the falling of molten
                lead drop by drop; “as to that — though no one ever hinted that either from fear or
                neglect your conduct has not been what it should have been — well, I have a bit of
                intelligence . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov could not prevent himself from raising his head, and Sophia Antonovna nodded
                slightly.</p>

            <p>“I have. You remember that letter from St. Petersburg I mentioned to you a moment
                ago?”</p>

            <p>“The letter? Perfectly. Some busybody has been reporting my conduct on a certain day.
                It’s rather sickening. I suppose our police are greatly edified when they open these
                interesting and — and — superfluous letters.”</p>

            <p>“Oh dear no! The police do not get hold of our letters as easily as you imagine. The
                letter in question did not leave St. Petersburg till the ice broke up. It went by
                the first English steamer which left the Neva this spring. They have a fireman on
                board — one of us, in fact. It has reached me from Hull . . . .”</p>

            <p>She paused as if she were surprised at the sullen fixity of Razumov’s gaze, but went
                on at once, and much faster.</p>

            <p>“We have some of our people there who . . . but never mind. The writer of the letter
                relates an incident which he thinks may possibly be connected with Haldin’s arrest.
                I was just going to tell you when those two men came along.”</p>

            <p>“That also was an incident,” muttered Razumov, “of a very charming kind — for
                me.”</p>

            <p>“Leave off that!” cried Sophia Antonovna.” Nobody cares for Nikita’s barking. There’s
                no malice in him. Listen to what I have to say. You may be able to throw a light.
                There was in St. Petersburg a sort of town peasant — a man who owned horses. He came
                to town years ago to work for some relation as a driver and ended by owning a cab or
                two.”</p>

            <p>She might well have spared herself the slight effort of the gesture: “Wait!” Razumov
                did not mean to speak; he could not have interrupted her now, not to save his life.
                The contraction of his facial muscles had been involuntary, a mere surface stir,
                leaving him sullenly attentive as before.</p>

            <p>“He was not a quite ordinary man of his class — it seems,” she went on. “ The people
                of the house — my informant talked with many of them — you know, one of those
                enormous houses of shame and misery . . . .”</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna need not have enlarged on the character of the house. Razumov saw
                clearly, towering at her back, a dark mass of masonry veiled in snowflakes, with the
                long row of windows of the eating-shop shining greasily very near the ground. The
                ghost of that night pursued him. He stood up to it with rage and with weariness.</p>

            <p>“Did the late Haldin ever by chance speak to you of that house?” Sophia Antonovna was
                anxious to know.</p>

            <p>“Yes.” Razumov, making that answer, wondered whether he were falling into a trap. It
                was so humiliating to lie to these people that he probably could not have said no.
                “He mentioned to me once,” he added, as if making an effort of memory, “ a house of
                that sort. He used to visit some workmen there.”</p>

            <p>“Exactly.”</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna triumphed. Her correspondent had discovered that fact quite
                accidentally from the talk of the people of the house, having made friends with a
                workman who occupied a room there. They described Haldin’s appearance perfectly. He
                brought comforting words of hope into their misery. He came irregularly, but he came
                very often, and — her correspondent wrote — sometimes he spent a night in the house,
                sleeping, they thought, in a stable which opened upon the inner yard.</p>

            <p>“Note that, Razumov! In a stable.”</p>

            <p>Razumov had listened with a sort of ferocious but amused acquiescence.</p>

            <p>“Yes. In the straw. It was probably the cleanest spot in the whole house.”</p>

            <p>“No doubt,” assented the woman with that deep frown which seemed to draw closer
                together her black eyes in a sinister fashion. No four-footed beast could stand the
                filth and wretchedness so many human beings were condemned to suffer from in Russia.
                The point of this discovery was that it proved Haldin to have been familiar with
                that horse-owning peasant — a reckless, independent, free-living fellow not much
                liked by the other inhabitants of the house. He was believed to have been the
                associate of a band of housebreakers. Some of these got captured. Not while he was
                driving them, however; but still there was a suspicion against the fellow of having
                given a hint to the police and . . . .</p>

            <p>The woman revolutionist checked herself suddenly.</p>

            <p>“And you? Have you ever heard your friend refer to a certain Ziemianitch?”</p>

            <p>Razumov was ready for the name. He had been looking out for the question. “When it
                comes I shall own up,” he had said to himself. But he took his time.</p>

            <p>“To be sure!” he began slowly. “Ziemianitch, a peasant owning a team of horses. Yes.
                On one occasion. Ziemianitch! Certainly! Ziemianitch of the horses. . . . How could
                it have slipped my memory like this? One of the last conversations we had
                together.”</p>

            <p>“That means,”— Sophia Antonovna looked very grave — “that means, Razumov, it was very
                shortly before — eh?”</p>

            <p>“Before what?” shouted Razumov, advancing at the woman, who looked astonished but
                stood her ground. “Before. . . . Oh! Of course, it was before! How could it have
                been after? Only a few hours before.”</p>

            <p>“And he spoke of him favourably?”</p>

            <p>“With enthusiasm! The horses of Ziemianitch! The free soul of Ziemianitch!”</p>

            <p>Razumov took a savage delight in the loud utterance of that name, which had never
                before crossed his lips audibly. He fixed his blazing eyes on the woman till at last
                her fascinated expression recalled him to himself.</p>

            <p>“The late Haldin,” he said, holding himself in, with downcast eyes, “was inclined to
                take sudden fancies to people, on — on — what shall I say — insufficient
                grounds.”</p>

            <p>“There!” Sophia Antonovna clapped her hands. “That, to my mind, settles it. The
                suspicions of my correspondent were aroused . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Aha! Your correspondent,” Razumov said in an almost openly mocking tone. ” What
                suspicions? How aroused? By this Ziemianitch? Probably some drunken, gabbling,
                plausible . . . .”</p>

            <p>“You talk as if you had known him.”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked up.</p>

            <p>“No. But I knew Haldin.”</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna nodded gravely.</p>

            <p>“I see. Every word you say confirms to my mind the suspicion communicated to me in
                that very interesting letter. This Ziemianitch was found one morning hanging from a
                hook in the stable — dead.”</p>

            <p>Razumov felt a profound trouble. It was visible, because Sophia Antonovna was moved
                to observe vivaciously —</p>

            <p>“Aha! You begin to see.”</p>

            <p>He saw it clearly enough — in the light of a lantern casting spokes of shadow in a
                cellar-like stable, the body in a sheepskin coat and long boots hanging against the
                wall. A pointed hood, with the ends wound about up to the eyes, hid the face. “But
                that does not concern me,” he reflected. “It does not affect my position at all. He
                never knew who had thrashed him. He could not have known.” Razumov felt sorry for
                the old lover of the bottle and women.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Some of them end like that,” he muttered. “What is your idea, Sophia
                Antonovna?”</p>

            <p>It was really the idea of her correspondent, but Sophia Antonovna had adopted it
                fully. She stated it in one word —“Remorse.” Razumov opened his eyes very wide at
                that. Sophia Antonovna’s informant, by listening to the talk of the house, by
                putting this and that together, had managed to come very near to the truth of
                Haldin’s relation to Ziemianitch.</p>

            <p>“It is I who can tell you what you were not certain of — that your friend had some
                plan for saving himself afterwards, for getting out of St. Petersburg, at any rate.
                Perhaps that and no more, trusting to luck for the rest. And that fellow’s horses
                were part of the plan.”</p>

            <p>“They have actually got at the truth,” Razumov marvelled to himself, while he nodded
                judicially. “Yes, that’s possible, very possible.” But the woman revolutionist was
                very positive that it was so. First of all, a conversation about horses between
                Haldin and Ziemianitch had been partly overheard. Then there were the suspicions of
                the people in the house when their “young gentleman” (they did not know Haldin by
                his name) ceased to call at the house. Some of them used to charge Ziemianitch with
                knowing something of this absence. He denied it with exasperation; but the fact was
                that ever since Haldin’s disappearance he was not himself, growing moody and thin.
                Finally, during a quarrel with some woman (to whom he was making up), in which most
                of the inmates of the house took part apparently, he was openly abused by his chief
                enemy, an athletic pedlar, for an informer, and for having driven ‘’ our young
                gentleman to Siberia, the same as you did those young fellows who broke into
                houses.” In consequence of this there was a fight, and Ziemianitch got flung down a
                flight of stairs. Thereupon he drank and moped for a week, and then hanged
                himself.</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna drew her conclusions from the tale. She charged Ziemianitch either
                with drunken indiscretion as to a driving job on a certain date, overheard by some
                spy in some low grog-shop — perhaps in the very eating-shop on the ground floor of
                the house — or, maybe, a downright denunciation, followed by remorse. A man like
                that would be capable of anything. People said he was a flighty old chap. And if he
                had been once before mixed up with the police — as seemed certain, though he always
                denied it — in connexion with these thieves, he would be sure to be acquainted with
                some police underlings, always on the look out for something to report. Possibly at
                first his tale was not made anything of till the day that scoundrel de P—— got his
                deserts. Ah! But then every bit and scrap of hint and information would be acted on,
                and fatally they were bound to get Haldin.</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna spread out her hands —” Fatally.”</p>

            <p>Fatality — chance! Razumov meditated in silent astonishment upon the queer
                verisimilitude of these inferences. They were obviously to his advantage.</p>

            <p>“It is right now to make this conclusive evidence known generally.” Sophia Antonovna
                was very calm and deliberate again. She had received the letter three days ago, but
                did not write at once to Peter Ivanovitch. She knew then that she would have the
                opportunity presently of meeting several men of action assembled for an important
                purpose.</p>

            <p>“I thought it would be more effective if I could show the letter itself at large. I
                have it in my pocket now. You understand how pleased I was to come upon you.”</p>

            <p>Razumov was saying to himself,” She won’t offer to show the letter to me. Not likely.
                Has she told me everything that correspondent of hers has found out?” He longed to
                see the letter, but he felt he must not ask.</p>

            <p>“Tell me, please, was this an investigation ordered, as it were?”</p>

            <p>“No, no,” she protested. “There you are again with your sensitiveness. It makes you
                stupid. Don’t you see, there was no starting-point for an investigation even if any
                one had thought of it. A perfect blank! That’s exactly what some people were
                pointing out as the reason for receiving you cautiously. It was all perfectly
                accidental, arising from my informant striking an acquaintance with an intelligent
                skindresser lodging in that particular slum-house. A wonderful coincidence!”</p>

            <p>“A pious person,” suggested Razumov, with a pale smile, “would say that the hand of
                God has done it all.”</p>

            <p>“My poor father would have said that.” Sophia Antonovna did not smile. She dropped
                her eyes.” Not that his God ever helped him. It’s a long time since God has done
                anything for the people. Anyway, it’s done.”</p>

            <p>“All this would be quite final,” said Razumov, with every appearance of reflective
                impartiality, “if there was any certitude that the ‘our young gentleman’ of these
                people was Victor Haldin. Have we got that?”</p>

            <p>“Yes. There’s no mistake. My correspondent was as familiar with Haldin’s personal
                appearance as with your own,” the woman affirmed decisively.</p>

            <p>“It’s the red-nosed fellow beyond a doubt,” Razumov said to himself, with reawakened
                uneasiness. Had his own visit to that accursed house passed unnoticed? It was barely
                possible. Yet it was hardly probable. It was just the right sort of food for the
                popular gossip that gaunt busybody had been picking up. But the letter did not seem
                to contain any allusion to that. Unless she had suppressed it. And, if so, why? If
                it had really escaped the prying of that hunger-stricken democrat with a confounded
                genius for recognizing people from description, it could only be for a time. He
                would come upon it presently and hasten to write another letter — and then!</p>

            <p>For all the envenomed recklessness of his temper, fed on hate and disdain, Razumov
                shuddered inwardly. It guarded him from common fear, but it could not defend him
                from disgust at being dealt with in any way by these people. It was a sort of
                superstitious dread. Now, since his position had been made more secure by their own
                folly at the cost of Ziemianitch, he felt the need of perfect safety, with its
                freedom from direct lying, with its power of moving amongst them silent,
                unquestioning, listening, impenetrable, like the very fate of their crimes and their
                folly. Was this advantage his already? Or not yet? Or never would be?</p>

            <p>“Well, Sophia Antonovna,” his air of reluctant concession was genuine in so far that
                he was really loath to part with her without testing her sincerity by a question it
                was impossible to bring about in any way; “well, Sophia Antonovna, if that is so,
                then —”</p>

            <p>“The creature has done justice to himself,” the woman observed, as if thinking
                aloud.</p>

            <p>“What? Ah yes! Remorse,” Razumov muttered, with equivocal contempt.</p>

            <p>“Don’t be harsh, Kirylo Sidorovitch, if you have lost a friend.” There was no hint of
                softness in her tone, only the black glitter of her eyes seemed detached for an
                instant from vengeful visions. “He was a man of the people. The simple Russian soul
                is never wholly impenitent. It’s something to know that.”</p>

            <p>“Consoling?” insinuated Razumov, in a tone of inquiry.</p>

            <p>“Leave off railing,” she checked him explosively. “Remember, Razumov, that women,
                children, and revolutionists hate irony, which is the negation of all saving
                instincts, of all faith, of all devotion, of all action. Don’t rail! Leave off.
                . . . I don’t know how it is, but there are moments when you are abhorrent to me
                . . . .”</p>

            <p>She averted her face. A languid silence, as if all the electricity of the situation
                had been discharged in this flash of passion, lasted for some time. Razumov had not
                flinched. Suddenly she laid the tips of her fingers on his sleeve.</p>

            <p>“Don’t mind.”</p>

            <p>“I don’t mind,” he said very quietly.</p>

            <p>He was proud to feel that she could read nothing on his face. He was really
                mollified, relieved, if only for a moment, from an obscure oppression. And suddenly
                he asked himself, “Why the devil did I go to that house? It was an imbecile thing to
                do.”</p>

            <p>A profound disgust came over him. Sophia Antonovna lingered, talking in a friendly
                manner with an evident conciliatory intention. And it was still about the famous
                letter, referring to various minute details given by her informant, who had never
                seen Ziemianitch. The “victim of remorse” had been buried several weeks before her
                correspondent began frequenting the house. It — the house — contained very good
                revolutionary material. The spirit of the heroic Haldin had passed through these
                dens of black wretchedness with a promise of universal redemption from all the
                miseries that oppress mankind. Razumov listened without hearing, gnawed by the
                newborn desire of safety with its independence from that degrading method of direct
                lying which at times he found it almost impossible to practice.</p>

            <p>No. The point he wanted to hear about could never come into this conversation. There
                was no way of bringing it forward. He regretted not having composed a perfect story
                for use abroad, in which his fatal connexion with the house might have been owned up
                to. But when he left Russia he did not know that Ziemianitch had hanged himself.
                And, anyway, who could have foreseen this woman’s “informant” stumbling upon that
                particular slum, of all the slums awaiting destruction in the purifying flame of
                social revolution? Who could have foreseen? Nobody! “It’s a perfect, diabolic
                surprise,” thought Razumov, calm-faced in his attitude of inscrutable superiority,
                nodding assent to Sophia Antonovna’s remarks upon the psychology of “the people,”
                “Oh yes — certainly,” rather coldly, but with a nervous longing in his fingers to
                tear some sort of confession out of her throat.</p>

            <p>Then, at the very last, on the point of separating, the feeling of relaxed tension
                already upon him, he heard Sophia Antonovna allude to the subject of his uneasiness.
                How it came about he could only guess, his mind being absent at the moment, but it
                must have sprung from Sophia Antonovna’s complaints of the illogical absurdity of
                the people. For instance — that Ziemianitch was notoriously irreligious, and yet, in
                the last weeks of his life, he suffered from the notion that he had been beaten by
                the devil.</p>

            <p>“The devil,” repeated Razumov, as though he had not heard aright.</p>

            <p>“The actual devil. The devil in person. You may well look astonished, Kirylo
                Sidorovitch. Early on the very night poor Haldin was taken, a complete stranger
                turned up and gave Ziemianitch a most fearful thrashing while he was lying
                dead-drunk in the stable. The wretched creature’s body was one mass of bruises. He
                showed them to the people in the house.”</p>

            <p>“But you, Sophia Antonovna, you don’t believe in the actual devil?”</p>

            <p>“Do you?” retorted the woman curtly. “Not but that there are plenty of men worse than
                devils to make a hell of this earth,” she muttered to herself.</p>

            <p>Razumov watched her, vigorous and white-haired, with the deep fold between her thin
                eyebrows, and her black glance turned idly away. It was obvious that she did not
                make much of the story — unless, indeed, this was the perfection of duplicity. “A
                dark young man,” she explained further. “Never seen there before, never seen
                afterwards. Why are you smiling, Razumov?”</p>

            <p>“At the devil being still young after all these ages,” he answered composedly. “But
                who was able to describe him, since the victim, you say, was dead-drunk at the
                time?”</p>

            <p>“Oh! The eating-house keeper has described him. An overbearing, swarthy young man in
                a student’s cloak, who came rushing in, demanded Ziemianitch, beat him furiously,
                and rushed away without a word, leaving the eating-house keeper paralysed with
                astonishment.”</p>

            <p>“Does he, too, believe it was the devil?”</p>

            <p>“That I can’t say. I am told he’s very reserved on the matter. Those sellers of
                spirits are great scoundrels generally. I should think he knows more of it than
                anybody.”</p>

            <p>“Well, and you, Sophia Antonovna, what’s your theory?” asked Razumov in a tone of
                great interest. “Yours and your informant’s, who is on the spot.”</p>

            <p>“I agree with him. Some police-hound in disguise. Who else could beat a helpless man
                so unmercifully? As for the rest, if they were out that day on every trail, old and
                new, it is probable enough that they might have thought it just as well to have
                Ziemianitch at hand for more information, or for identification, or what not. Some
                scoundrelly detective was sent to fetch him along, and being vexed at finding him so
                drunk broke a stable fork over his ribs. Later on, after they had the big game safe
                in the net, they troubled their heads no more about that peasant.”</p>

            <p>Such were the last words of the woman revolutionist in this conversation, keeping so
                close to the truth, departing from it so far in the verisimilitude of thoughts and
                conclusions as to give one the notion of the invincible nature of human error, a
                glimpse into the utmost depths of self-deception. Razumov, after shaking hands with
                Sophia Antonovna, left the grounds, crossed the road, and walking out on the little
                steamboat pier leaned over the rail.</p>

            <p>His mind was at ease; ease such as he had not known for many days, ever since that
                night . . . the night. The conversation with the woman revolutionist had given him
                the view of his danger at the very moment this danger vanished, characteristically
                enough. “I ought to have foreseen the doubts that would arise in those people’s
                minds,” he thought. Then his attention being attracted by a stone of peculiar shape,
                which he could see clearly lying at the bottom, he began to speculate as to the
                depth of water in that spot. But very soon, with a start of wonder at this
                extraordinary instance of ill-timed detachment, he returned to his train of thought.
                “I ought to have told very circumstantial lies from the first,” he said to himself,
                with a mortal distaste of the mere idea which silenced his mental utterance for
                quite a perceptible interval. “Luckily, that’s all right now,” he reflected, and
                after a time spoke to himself, half aloud, “Thanks to the devil,” and laughed a
                little.</p>

            <p>The end of Ziemianitch then arrested his wandering thoughts. He was not exactly
                amused at the interpretation, but he could not help detecting — in it a certain
                piquancy. He owned to himself that, had he known of that suicide before leaving
                Russia, he would have been incapable of making such excellent use of it for his own
                purposes. He ought to be infinitely obliged to the fellow with the red nose for his
                patience and ingenuity, “A wonderful psychologist apparently,” he said to himself
                sarcastically. Remorse, indeed! It was a striking example of your true conspirator’s
                blindness, of the stupid subtlety of people with one idea. This was a drama of love,
                not of conscience, Razumov continued to himself mockingly. A woman the old fellow
                was making up to! A robust pedlar, clearly a rival, throwing him down a flight of
                stairs. . . . And at sixty, for a lifelong lover, it was not an easy matter to get
                over. That was a feminist of a different stamp from Peter Ivanovitch. Even the
                comfort of the bottle might conceivably fail him in this supreme crisis. At such an
                age nothing but a halter could cure the pangs of an unquenchable passion. And,
                besides, there was the wild exasperation aroused by the unjust aspersions and the
                contumely of the house, with the maddening impossibility to account for that
                mysterious thrashing, added to these simple and bitter sorrows. “Devil, eh?” Razumov
                exclaimed, with mental excitement, as if he had made an interesting discovery.
                “Ziemianitch ended by falling into mysticism. So many of our true Russian souls end
                in that way! Very characteristic.” He felt pity for Ziemianitch, a large neutral
                pity, such as one may feel for an unconscious multitude, a great people seen from
                above — like a community of crawling ants working out its destiny. It was as if this
                Ziemianitch could not possibly have done anything else. And Sophia Antonovna’s
                cocksure and contemptuous “some police-hound” was characteristically Russian in
                another way. But there was no tragedy there. This was a comedy of errors. It was as
                if the devil himself were playing a game with all of them in turn. First with him,
                then with Ziemianitch, then with those revolutionists. The devil’s own game this.
                . . . He interrupted his earnest mental soliloquy with a jocular thought at his own
                expense. “Hallo! I am falling into mysticism too.”</p>

            <p>His mind was more at ease than ever. Turning about he put his back against the rail
                comfortably. “All this fits with marvellous aptness,” he continued to think. “The
                brilliance of my reputed exploit is no longer darkened by the fate of my supposed
                colleague. The mystic Ziemianitch accounts for that. An incredible chance has served
                me. No more need of lies. I shall have only to listen and to keep my scorn from
                getting the upper hand of my caution.”</p>

            <p>He sighed, folded his arms, his chin dropped on his breast, and it was a long time
                before he started forward from that pose, with the recollection that he had made up
                his mind to do something important that day. What it was he could not immediately
                recall, yet he made no effort of memory, for he was uneasily certain that he would
                remember presently.</p>

            <p>He had not gone more than a hundred yards towards the town when he slowed down,
                almost faltered in his walk, at the sight of a figure walking in the contrary
                direction, draped in a cloak, under a soft, broad-brimmed hat, picturesque but
                diminutive, as if seen through the big end of an opera-glass. It was impossible to
                avoid that tiny man, for there was no issue for retreat.</p>

            <p>“Another one going to that mysterious meeting,” thought Razumov. He was right in his
                surmise, only <hi>this</hi> one, unlike the others who came from a distance, was
                known to him personally. Still, he hoped to pass on with a mere bow, but it was
                impossible to ignore the little thin hand with hairy wrist and knuckles protruded in
                a friendly wave from under the folds of the cloak, worn Spanish-wise, in disregard
                of a fairly warm day, a corner flung over the shoulder.</p>

            <p>“And how is Herr Razumov?” sounded the greeting in German, by that alone made more
                odious to the object of the affable recognition. At closer quarters the diminutive
                personage looked like a reduction of an ordinary-sized man, with a lofty brow bared
                for a moment by the raising of the hat, the great pepper-and salt full beard spread
                over the proportionally broad chest. A fine bold nose jutted over a thin mouth
                hidden in the mass of fine hair. All this, accented features, strong limbs in their
                relative smallness, appeared delicate without the slightest sign of debility. The
                eyes alone, almond-shaped and brown, were too big, with the whites slightly
                bloodshot by much pen labour under a lamp. The obscure celebrity of the tiny man was
                well known to Razumov. Polyglot, of unknown parentage, of indefinite nationality,
                anarchist, with a pedantic and ferocious temperament, and an amazingly inflammatory
                capacity for invective, he was a power in the background, this violent pamphleteer
                clamouring for revolutionary justice, this Julius Laspara, editor of the <hi>Living
                    Word</hi>, confidant of conspirators, inditer of sanguinary menaces and
                manifestos, suspected of being in the secret of every plot. Laspara lived in the old
                town in a sombre, narrow house presented to him by a naive middle-class admirer of
                his humanitarian eloquence. With him lived his two daughters, who overtopped him
                head and shoulders, and a pasty-faced, lean boy of six, languishing in the dark
                rooms in blue cotton overalls and clumsy boots, who might have belonged to either
                one of them or to neither. No stranger could tell. Julius Laspara no doubt knew
                which of his girls it was who, after casually vanishing for a few years, had as
                casually returned to him possessed of that child; but, with admirable pedantry, he
                had refrained from asking her for details — no, not so much as the name of the
                father, because maternity should be an anarchist function. Razumov had been admitted
                twice to that suite of several small dark rooms on the top floor: dusty
                window-panes, litter of all sorts of sweepings all over the place, half-full glasses
                of tea forgotten on every table, the two Laspara daughters prowling about
                enigmatically silent, sleepy-eyed, corsetless, and generally, in their want of shape
                and the disorder of their rumpled attire, resembling old dolls; the great but
                obscure Julius, his feet twisted round his three-legged stool, always ready to
                receive the visitors, the pen instantly dropped, the body screwed round with a
                striking display of the lofty brow and of the great austere beard. When he got down
                from his stool it was as though he had descended from the heights of Olympus. He was
                dwarfed by his daughters, by the furniture, by any caller of ordinary stature. But
                he very seldom left it, and still more rarely was seen walking in broad
                daylight.</p>

            <p>It must have been some matter of serious importance which had driven him out in that
                direction that afternoon. Evidently he wished to be amiable to that young man whose
                arrival had made some sensation in the world of political refugees. In Russian now,
                which he spoke, as he spoke and wrote four or five other European languages, without
                distinction and without force (other than that of invective), he inquired if Razumov
                had taken his inscriptions at the University as yet. And the young man, shaking his
                head negatively —</p>

            <p>“There’s plenty of time for that. But, meantime, are you not going to write something
                for us?”</p>

            <p>He could not understand how any one could refrain from writing on anything, social,
                economic, historical — anything. Any subject could be treated in the right spirit,
                and for the ends of social revolution. And, as it happened, a friend of his in
                London had got in touch with a review of advanced ideas. “We must educate, educate
                everybody — develop the great thought of absolute liberty and of revolutionary
                justice.”</p>

            <p>Razumov muttered rather surlily that he did not even know English.</p>

            <p>“Write in Russian. We’ll have it translated There can be no difficulty. Why, without
                seeking further, there is Miss Haldin. My daughters go to see her sometimes.” He
                nodded significantly. “ She does nothing, has never done anything in her life. She
                would be quite competent, with a little assistance. Only write. You know you must.
                And so good-bye for the present.”</p>

            <p>He raised his arm and went on. Razumov backed against the low wall, looked after him,
                spat violently, and went on his way with an angry mutter —</p>

            <p>“Cursed Jew!”</p>

            <p>He did not know anything about it. Julius Laspara might have been a Transylvanian, a
                Turk, an Andalusian, or a citizen of one of the Hanse towns for anything he could
                tell to the contrary. But this is not a story of the West, and this exclamation must
                be recorded, accompanied by the comment that it was merely an expression of hate and
                contempt, best adapted to the nature of the feelings Razumov suffered from at the
                time. He was boiling with rage, as though he had been grossly insulted. He walked as
                if blind, following instinctively the shore of the diminutive harbour along the
                quay, through a pretty, dull garden, where dull people sat on chairs under the
                trees, till, his fury abandoning him, he discovered himself in the middle of a long,
                broad bridge. He slowed down at once. To his right, beyond the toy-like jetties, he
                saw the green slopes framing the Petit Lac in all the marvellous banality of the
                picturesque made of painted cardboard, with the more distant stretch of water
                inanimate and shining like a piece of tin.</p>

            <p>He turned his head away from that view for the tourists, and walked on slowly, his
                eyes fixed on the ground. One or two persons had to get out of his way, and then
                turned round to give a surprised stare to his profound absorption. The insistence of
                the celebrated subversive journalist rankled in his mind strangely. Write. Must
                write! He! Write! A sudden light flashed upon him. To write was the very thing he
                had made up his mind to do that day. He had made up his mind irrevocably to that
                step and then had forgotten all about it. That incorrigible tendency to escape from
                the grip of the situation was fraught with serious danger. He was ready to despise
                himself for it. What was it? Levity, or deep-seated weakness? Or an unconscious
                dread?”</p>

            <p>“Is it that I am shrinking? It can’t be! It’s impossible. To shrink now would be
                worse than moral suicide; it would be nothing less than moral damnation,” he
                thought. “Is it possible that I have a conventional conscience? “</p>

            <p>He rejected that hypothesis with scorn, and, checked on the edge of the pavement,
                made ready to cross the road and proceed up the wide street facing the head of the
                bridge; and that for no other reason except that it was there before him. But at the
                moment a couple of carriages and a slow-moving cart interposed, and suddenly he
                turned sharp to the left, following the quay again, but now away from the lake.</p>

            <p>“It may be just my health,” he thought, allowing himself a very unusual doubt of his
                soundness; for, with the exception of a childish ailment or two, he had never been
                ill in his life. But that was a danger, too. Only, it seemed as though he were being
                looked after in a specially remarkable way. “If I believed in an active Providence,”
                Razumov said to himself, amused grimly, “I would see here the working of an ironical
                finger. To have a Julius Laspara put in my way as if expressly to remind me of my
                purpose is — Write, he had said. I must write — I must, indeed! I shall write —
                never fear. Certainly. That’s why I am here. And for the future I shall have
                something to write about.”</p>

            <p>He was exciting himself by this mental soliloquy. But the idea of writing evoked the
                thought of a place to write in, of shelter, of privacy, and naturally of his
                lodgings, mingled with a distaste for the necessary exertion of getting there, with
                a mistrust as of some hostile influence awaiting him within those odious four
                walls.</p>

            <p>“Suppose one of these revolutionists,” he asked himself, “were to take a fancy to
                call on me while I am writing?” The mere prospect of such an interruption made him
                shudder. One could lock one’s door, or ask the tobacconist downstairs (some sort of
                a refugee himself) to tell inquirers that one was not in. Not very good precautions
                those. The manner of his life, he felt, must be kept clear of every cause for
                suspicion or even occasion for wonder, down to such trifling occurrences as a delay
                in opening a locked door. “I wish I were in the middle of some field miles away from
                everywhere,” he thought.</p>

            <p>He had unconsciously turned to the left once more and now was aware of being on a
                bridge again. This one was much narrower than the other, and instead of being
                straight, made a sort of elbow or angle. At the point of that angle a short arm
                joined it to a hexagonal islet with a soil of gravel and its shores faced with
                dressed stone, a perfection of puerile neatness. A couple of tall poplars and a few
                other trees stood grouped on the clean, dark gravel, and under them a few garden
                benches and a bronze effigy of Jean Jacques Rousseau seated on its pedestal.</p>

            <p>On setting his foot on it Razumov became aware that, except for the woman in charge
                of the refreshment chalet, he would be alone on the island. There was something of
                naive, odious, and inane simplicity about that unfrequented tiny crumb of earth
                named after Jean Jacques Rousseau. Something pretentious and shabby, too. He asked
                for a glass of milk, which he drank standing, at one draught (nothing but tea had
                passed his lips since the morning), and was going away with a weary, lagging step
                when a thought stopped him short. He had found precisely what he needed. If solitude
                could ever be secured in the open air in the middle of a town, he would have it
                there on this absurd island, together with the faculty of watching the only
                approach.</p>

            <p>He went back heavily to a garden seat, dropped into it. This was the place for making
                a beginning of that writing which had to be done. The materials he had on him. “I
                shall always come here,” he said to himself, and afterwards sat for quite a long
                time motionless, without thought and sight and hearing, almost without life. He sat
                long enough for the declining sun to dip behind the roofs of the town at his back,
                and throw the shadow of the houses on the lake front over the islet, before he
                pulled out of his pocket a fountain pen, opened a small notebook on his knee, and
                began to write quickly, raising his eyes now and then at the connecting arm of the
                bridge. These glances were needless; the people crossing over in the distance seemed
                unwilling even to look at the islet where the exiled effigy of the author of the
                    <hi>Social Contract</hi> sat enthroned above the bowed head of Razumov in the
                sombre immobility of bronze. After finishing his scribbling, Razumov, with a sort of
                feverish haste, put away the pen, then rammed the notebook into his pocket, first
                tearing out the written pages with an almost convulsive brusqueness. But the folding
                of the flimsy batch on his knee was executed with thoughtful nicety. That done, he
                leaned back in his seat and remained motionless, the papers holding in his left
                hand. The twilight had deepened. He got up and began to pace to and fro slowly under
                the trees.</p>

            <p>“There can be no doubt that now I am safe,” he thought. His fine ear could detect the
                faintly accentuated murmurs of the current breaking against the point of the island,
                and he forgot himself in listening to them with interest. But even to his acute
                sense of hearing the sound was too elusive.</p>

            <p>“Extraordinary occupation I am giving myself up to,” he murmured. And it occurred to
                him that this was about the only sound he could listen to innocently, and for his
                own pleasure, as it were. Yes, the sound of water, the voice of the wind —
                completely foreign to human passions. All the other sounds of this earth brought
                contamination to the solitude of a soul.</p>

            <p>This was Mr. Razumov’s feeling, the soul, of course, being his own, and the word
                being used not in the theological sense, but standing, as far as I can understand
                it, for that part of Mr. Razumov which was not his body, and more specially in
                danger from the fires of this earth. And it must be admitted that in Mr. Razumov’s
                case the bitterness of solitude from which he suffered was not an altogether morbid
                phenomenon.</p>

            <head>PART FOUR</head>

            <head>1</head>


            <p>That I should, at the beginning of this retrospect, mention again that Mr. Razumov’s
                youth had no one in the world, as literally no one as it can be honestly affirmed of
                any human being, is but a statement of fact from a man who believes in the
                psychological value of facts. There is also, perhaps, a desire of punctilious
                fairness. Unidentified with anyone in this narrative where the aspects of honour and
                shame are remote from the ideas of the Western world, and taking my stand on the
                ground of common humanity, it is for that very reason that I feel a strange
                reluctance to state baldly here what every reader has most likely already discovered
                himself. Such reluctance may appear absurd if it were not for the thought that
                because of the imperfection of language there is always something ungracious (and
                even disgraceful) in the exhibition of naked truth. But the time has come when
                Councillor of State Mikulin can no longer be ignored. His simple question “Where
                to?” on which we left Mr. Razumov in St. Petersburg, throws a light on the general
                meaning of this individual case.</p>

            <p>“Where to?” was the answer in the form of a gentle question to what we may call Mr.
                Razumov’s declaration of independence. The question was not menacing in the least
                and, indeed, had the ring of innocent inquiry. Had it been taken in a merely
                topographical sense, the only answer to it would have appeared sufficiently
                appalling to Mr Razumov. Where to? Back to his rooms, where the Revolution had
                sought him out to put to a sudden test his dormant instincts, his half-conscious
                thoughts and almost wholly unconscious ambitions, by the touch as of some furious
                and dogmatic religion, with its call to frantic sacrifices, its tender resignations,
                its dreams and hopes uplifting the soul by the side of the most sombre moods of
                despair. And Mr. Razumov had let go the door-handle and had come back to the middle
                of the room, asking Councillor Mikulin angrily, “What do you mean by it”</p>

            <p>As far as I can tell, Councillor Mikulin did not answer that question. He drew Mr.
                Razumov into familiar conversation. It is the peculiarity of Russian natures that,
                however strongly engaged in the drama of action, they are still turning their ear to
                the murmur of abstract ideas. This conversation (and others later on) need not be
                recorded. Suffice it to say that it brought Mr. Razumov as we know him to the test
                of another faith. There was nothing official in its expression, and Mr. Razumov was
                led to defend his attitude of detachment. But Councillor Mikulin would have none of
                his arguments. “For a man like you,” were his last weighty words in the discussion,
                “such a position is impossible. Don’t forget that I have seen that interesting piece
                of paper. I understand your liberalism. I have an intellect of that kind myself.
                Reform for me is mainly a question of method. But the principle of revolt is a
                physical intoxication, a sort of hysteria which must be kept away from the masses.
                You agree to this without reserve, don’t you? Because, you see, Kirylo Sidorovitch,
                abstention, reserve, in certain situations, come very near to political crime. The
                ancient Greeks understood that very well.”</p>

            <p>Mr. Razumov, listening with a faint smile, asked Councillor Mikulin point-blank if
                this meant that he was going to have him watched.</p>

            <p>The high official took no offence at the cynical inquiry.</p>

            <p>“No, Kirylo Sidorovitch,” he answered gravely. “I don’t mean to have you
                watched.”</p>

            <p>Razumov, suspecting a lie, affected yet the greatest liberty of mind during the short
                remainder of that interview. The older man expressed himself throughout in familiar
                terms, and with a sort of shrewd simplicity. Razumov concluded that to get to the
                bottom of that mind was an impossible feat. A great disquiet made his heart beat
                quicker. The high official, issuing from behind the desk, was actually offering to
                shake hands with him.</p>

            <p>“Good-bye, Mr Razumov. An understanding between intelligent men is always a
                satisfactory occurrence. Is it not? And, of course, these rebel gentlemen have not
                the monopoly of intelligence.”</p>

            <p>“I presume that I shall not be wanted any more?” Razumov brought out that question
                while his hand was still being grasped. Councillor Mikulin released it slowly.</p>

            <p>“That, Mr. Razumov,” he said with great earnestness, “is as it may be. God alone
                knows the future. But you may rest assured that I never thought of having you
                watched. You are a young man of great independence. Yes. You are going away free as
                air, but you shall end by coming back to us.”</p>

            <p>“I! I!” Razumov exclaimed in an appalled murmur of protest. “What for?” he added
                feebly.</p>

            <p>“Yes! You yourself, Kirylo Sidorovitch,” the high police functionary insisted in a
                low, severe tone of conviction. “You shall be coming back to us. Some of our
                greatest minds had to do that in the end.”</p>

            <p>You have no better friend than Prince K— — and as to myself it is a long time now
                since I’ve been honoured by his . . . .”</p>

            <p>He glanced down his beard.</p>

            <p>“I won’t detain you any longer. We live in difficult times, in times of monstrous
                chimeras and evil dreams and criminal follies. We shall certainly meet once more. It
                may be some little time, though, before we do. Till then may Heaven send you
                fruitful reflections!” Once in the street, Razumov started off rapidly, without
                caring for the direction. At first he thought of nothing; but in a little while the
                consciousness of his position presented itself to him as something so ugly,
                dangerous, and absurd, the difficulty of ever freeing himself from the toils of that
                complication so insoluble, that the idea of going back and, as he termed it to
                himself, confessing to Councillor Mikulin flashed through his mind.</p>

            <p>Go back! What for? Confess! To what? “I have been speaking to him with the greatest
                openness,” he said to himself with perfect truth. “What else could I tell him? That
                I have undertaken to carry a message to that brute Ziemianitch? Establish a false
                complicity and destroy what chance of safety I have won for nothing — what
                folly!”</p>

            <p>Yet he could not defend himself from fancying that Councillor Mikulin was, perhaps,
                the only man in the world able to understand his conduct. To be understood appeared
                extremely fascinating.</p>

            <p>On the way home he had to stop several times; all his strength seemed to run out of
                his limbs; and in the movement of the busy streets, isolated as if in a desert, he
                remained suddenly motionless for a minute or so before he could proceed on his way.
                He reached his rooms at last</p>

            <p>Then came an illness, something in the nature of a low fever, which all at once
                removed him to a great distance from the perplexing actualities, from his very room,
                even. He never lost consciousness; he only seemed to himself to be existing
                languidly somewhere very far away from everything that had ever happened to him. He
                came out of this state slowly, with an effect, that is to say, of extreme slowness,
                though the actual number of days was not very great. And when he had got back into
                the middle of things they were all changed, subtly and provokingly in their nature:
                inanimate objects, human faces, the landlady, the rustic servant-girl, the
                staircase, the streets, the very air. He tackled these changed conditions in a
                spirit of severity. He walked to and fro to the University, ascended stairs, paced
                the passages, listened to lectures, took notes, crossed courtyards in angry
                aloofness, his teeth set hard till his jaws ached.</p>

            <p>He was perfectly aware of madcap Kostia gazing like a young retriever from a
                distance, of the famished student with the red drooping nose, keeping scrupulously
                away as desired; of twenty others, perhaps, he knew well enough to speak to. And
                they all had an air of curiosity and concern as if they expected something to
                happen. “This can’t last much longer,” thought Razumov more than once. On certain
                days he was afraid that anyone addressing him suddenly in a certain way would make
                him scream out insanely a lot of filthy abuse. Often, after returning home, he would
                drop into a chair in his cap and cloak and remain still for hours holding some book
                he had got from the library in his hand; or he would pick up the little penknife and
                sit there scraping his nails endlessly and feeling furious all the time — simply
                furious. “This is impossible,” he would mutter suddenly to the empty room.</p>

            <p>Fact to be noted: this room might conceivably have become physically repugnant to
                him, emotionally intolerable, morally uninhabitable. But no. Nothing of the sort
                (and he had himself dreaded it at first), nothing of the sort happened. On the
                contrary, he liked his lodgings better than any other shelter he, who had never
                known a home, had ever hired before. He liked his lodgings so well that often, on
                that very account, he found a certain difficulty in making up his mind to go out. It
                resembled a physical seduction such as, for instance, makes a man reluctant to leave
                the neighbourhood of a fire on a cold day.</p>

            <p>For as, at that time, he seldom stirred except to go to the University (what else was
                there to do?) it followed that whenever he went abroad he felt himself at once
                closely involved in the moral consequences of his act. It was there that the dark
                prestige of the Haldin mystery fell on him, clung to him like a poisoned robe it was
                impossible to fling off. He suffered from it exceedingly, as well as from the
                conversational, commonplace, unavoidable intercourse with the other kind of
                students. “They must be wondering at the change in me,” he reflected anxiously. He
                had an uneasy recollection of having savagely told one or two innocent, nice enough
                fellows to go to the devil. Once a married professor he used to call upon formerly
                addressed him in passing: “How is it we never see you at our Wednesdays now, Kirylo
                Sidorovitch?” Razumov was conscious of meeting this advance with odious, muttering
                boorishness. The professor was obviously too astonished to be offended. All this was
                bad. And all this was Haldin, always Haldin — nothing but Haldin — everywhere
                Haldin: a moral spectre infinitely more effective than any visible apparition of the
                dead. It was only the room through which that man had blundered on his way from
                crime to death that his spectre did not seem to be able to haunt. Not, to be exact,
                that he was ever completely absent from it, but that there he had no sort of power.
                There it was Razumov who had the upper hand, in a composed sense of his own
                superiority. A vanquished phantom — nothing more. Often in the evening, his repaired
                watch faintly ticking on the table by the side of the lighted lamp, Razumov would
                look up from his writing and stare at the bed with an expectant, dispassionate
                attention. Nothing was to be seen there. He never really supposed that anything ever
                could be seen there. After a while he would shrug his shoulders slightly and bend
                again over his work. For he had gone to work and, at first, with some success. His
                unwillingness to leave that place where he was safe from Haldin grew so strong that
                at last he ceased to go out at all. From early morning till far into the night he
                wrote, he wrote for nearly a week; never looking at the time, and only throwing
                himself on the bed when he could keep his eyes open no longer. Then, one afternoon,
                quite casually, he happened to glance at his watch. He laid down his pen slowly.</p>

            <p>“At this very hour,” was his thought, “the fellow stole unseen into this room while I
                was out. And there he sat quiet as a mouse — perhaps in this very chair.” Razumov
                got up and began to pace the floor steadily, glancing at the watch now and then. “
                This is the time when I returned and found him standing against the stove,” he
                observed to himself. When it grew dark he lit his lamp. Later on he interrupted his
                tramping once more, only to wave away angrily the girl who attempted to enter the
                room with tea and something to eat on a tray. And presently he noted the watch
                pointing at the hour of his own going forth into the falling snow on that terrible
                errand.</p>

            <p>“Complicity,” he muttered faintly, and resumed his pacing, keeping his eye on the
                hands as they crept on slowly to the time of his return.</p>

            <p>“And, after all,” he thought suddenly, “I might have been the chosen instrument of
                Providence. This is a manner of speaking, but there may be truth in every manner of
                speaking. What if that absurd saying were true in its essence?”</p>

            <p>He meditated for a while, then sat down, his legs stretched out, with stony eyes, and
                with his arms hanging down on each side of the chair like a man totally abandoned by
                Providence — desolate.</p>

            <p>He noted the time of Haldin’s departure and continued to sit still for another
                half-hour; then muttering, “And now to work,” drew up to the table, seized the pen
                and instantly dropped it under the influence of a profoundly disquieting reflection:
                “There’s three weeks gone by and no word from Mikulin.”</p>

            <p>What did it mean! Was he forgotten? Possibly. Then why not remain forgotten — creep
                in somewhere? Hide. But where? How? With whom? In what hole? And was it to be for
                ever, or what?</p>

            <p>But a retreat was big with shadowy dangers. The eye of the social revolution was on
                him, and Razumov for a moment felt an unnamed and despairing dread, mingled with an
                odious sense of humiliation. Was it possible that he no longer belonged to himself?
                This was damnable. But why not simply keep on as before? Study. Advance. Work hard
                as if nothing had happened (and first of all win the Silver Medal), acquire
                distinction, become a great reforming servant of the greatest of States. Servant,
                too, of the mightiest homogeneous mass of mankind with a capability for logical,
                guided development in a brotherly solidarity of force and aim such as the world had
                never dreamt of . . . the Russian nation!</p>

            <p>Calm, resolved, steady in his great purpose, he was stretching his hand towards the
                pen when he happened to glance towards the bed. He rushed at it, enraged, with a
                mental scream: “it’s you, crazy fanatic, who stands in the way!” He flung the pillow
                on the floor violently, tore the blankets aside. . . . Nothing there. And, turning
                away, he caught for an instant in the air, like a vivid detail in a dissolving view
                of two heads, the eyes of General T—— and of Privy-Councillor Mikulin side by side
                fixed upon him, quite different in character, but with the same unflinching and
                weary and yet purposeful expression . . . servants of the nation!</p>

            <p>Razumov tottered to the washstand very alarmed about himself, drank some water and
                bathed his forehead. “This will pass and leave no trace,” he thought confidently. “I
                am all right.” But as to supposing that he had been forgotten it was perfect
                nonsense. He was a marked man on that side. And that was nothing. It was what that
                miserable phantom stood for which had to be got out of the way. . . . “If one only
                could go and spit it all out at some of them — and take the consequences.”</p>

            <p>He imagined himself accosting the red-nosed student and suddenly shaking his fist in
                his face. “From that one, though,” he reflected,” there’s nothing to be got, because
                he has no mind of his own. He’s living in a red democratic trance. Ah! you want to
                smash your way into universal happiness, my boy. I will give you universal
                happiness, you silly, hypnotized ghoul, you! And what about my own happiness, eh?
                Haven’t I got any right to it, just because I can think for myself?. . .”</p>

            <p>And again, but with a different mental accent, Razumov said to himself, “I am young.
                Everything can be lived down.” At that moment he was crossing the room slowly,
                intending to sit down on the sofa and try to compose his thoughts. But before he had
                got so far everything abandoned him — hope, courage, belief in himself trust in men.
                His heart had, as it were, suddenly emptied itself. It was no use struggling on.
                Rest, work, solitude, and the frankness of intercourse with his kind were alike
                forbidden to him. Everything was gone. His existence was a great cold blank,
                something like the enormous plain of the whole of Russia levelled with snow and
                fading gradually on all sides into shadows and mists.</p>

            <p>He sat down, with swimming head, closed his eyes, and remained like that, sitting
                bolt upright on the sofa and perfectly awake for the rest of the night; till the
                girl bustling into the outer room with the samovar thumped with her fist on the
                door, calling out,” Kirylo Sidorovitch, please! It is time for you to get up!”</p>

            <p>Then, pale like a corpse obeying the dread summons of judgement, Razumov opened his
                eyes and got up.</p>

            <p>Nobody will be surprised to hear, I suppose, that when the summons came he went to
                see Councillor Mikulin. It came that very morning, while, looking white and shaky,
                like an invalid just out of bed, he was trying to shave himself. The envelope was
                addressed in the little attorney’s handwriting. That envelope contained another,
                superscribed to Razumov, in Prince K——‘s hand, with the request “Please forward
                under cover at once” in a corner. The note inside was an autograph of Councillor
                Mikulin. The writer stated candidly that nothing had arisen which needed clearing
                up, but nevertheless appointed a meeting with Mr. Razumov at a certain address in
                town which seemed to be that of an oculist.</p>

            <p>Razumov read it, finished shaving, dressed, looked at the note again, and muttered
                gloomily, “Oculist.” He pondered over it for a time, lit a match, and burned the two
                envelopes and the enclosure carefully. Afterwards he waited, sitting perfectly idle
                and not even looking at anything in particular till the appointed hour drew near —
                and then went out.</p>

            <p>Whether, looking at the unofficial character of the summons, he might have refrained
                from attending to it is hard to say. Probably not. At any rate, he went; but, what’s
                more, he went with a certain eagerness, which may appear incredible till it is
                remembered that Councillor Mikulin was the only person on earth with whom Razumov
                could talk, taking the Haldin adventure for granted. And Haldin, when once taken for
                granted, was no longer a haunting, falsehood-breeding spectre. Whatever troubling
                power he exercised in all the other places of the earth, Razumov knew very well that
                at this oculist’s address he would be merely the hanged murderer of M. de P—— and
                nothing more. For the dead can live only with the exact intensity and quality of the
                life imparted to them by the living. So Mr. Razumov, certain of relief, went to meet
                Councillor Mikulin with he eagerness of a pursued person welcoming any sort of
                shelter.</p>

            <p>This much said, there is no need to tell anything more of that first interview and of
                the several others. To the morality of a Western reader an account of these meetings
                would wear perhaps the sinister character of old legendary tales where the Enemy of
                Mankind is represented holding subtly mendacious dialogues with some tempted soul.
                It is not my part to protest. Let me but remark that the Evil One, with his single
                passion of satanic pride for the only motive, is yet, on a larger, modern view,
                allowed to be not quite so black as he used to be painted. With what greater
                latitude, then, should we appraise the exact shade of mere mortal man, with his many
                passions and his miserable ingenuity in error, always dazzled by the base glitter of
                mixed motives, everlastingly betrayed by a short-sighted wisdom.</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin was one of those powerful officials who, in a position not
                obscure, not occult, but simply inconspicuous, exercise a great influence over the
                methods rather than over the conduct of affairs. A devotion to Church and Throne is
                not in itself a criminal sentiment; to prefer the will of one to the will of many
                does not argue the possession of a black heart or prove congenital idiocy.
                Councillor Mikulin was not only a clever but also a faithful official. Privately he
                was a bachelor with a love of comfort, living alone in an apartment of five rooms
                luxuriously furnished; and was known by his intimates to be an enlightened patron of
                the art of female dancing. Later on the larger world first heard of him in the very
                hour of his downfall, during one of those State trials which astonish and puzzle the
                average plain man who reads the newspapers, by a glimpse of unsuspected intrigues.
                And in the stir of vaguely seen monstrosities, in that momentary, mysterious
                disturbance of muddy waters, Councillor Mikulin went under, dignified, with only a
                calm, emphatic protest of his innocence — nothing more. No disclosures damaging to a
                harassed autocracy, complete fidelity to the secrets of the miserable <hi>arcana
                    imperii</hi> deposited in his patriotic breast, a display of bureaucratic
                stoicism in a Russian official’s ineradicable, almost sublime contempt for truth;
                stoicism of silence understood only by the very few of the initiated, and not
                without a certain cynical grandeur of self-sacrifice on the part of a sybarite. For
                the terribly heavy sentence turned Councillor Mikulin civilly into a corpse, and
                actually into something very much like a common convict.</p>

            <p>It seems that the savage autocracy, no more than the divine democracy, does not limit
                its diet exclusively to the bodies of its enemies. It devours its friends and
                servants as well. The downfall of His Excellency Gregory Gregorievitch Mikulin
                (which did not occur till some years later) completes all that is known of the man.
                But at the time of M. de P——‘s murder (or execution) Councillor Mikulin, under the
                modest style of Head of Department at the General Secretariat, exercised a wide
                influence as the confidant and right-hand man of his former schoolfellow and
                lifelong friend, General T——. One can imagine them talking over the case of Mr.
                Razumov, with the full sense of their unbounded power over all the lives in Russia,
                with cursory disdain, like two Olympians glancing at a worm. The relationship with
                Prince K—— was enough to save Razumov from some carelessly arbitrary proceeding, and
                it is also very probable that after the interview at the Secretariat he would have
                been left alone. Councillor Mikulin would not have forgotten him (he forgot no one
                who ever fell under his observation), but would have simply dropped him for ever.
                Councillor Mikulin was a good-natured man and wished no harm to anyone. Besides
                (with his own reforming tendencies) he was favourably impressed by that young
                student, the son of Prince K— — and apparently no fool.</p>

            <p>But as fate would have it, while Mr. Razumov was finding that no way of life was
                possible to him, Councillor Mikulin’s discreet abilities were rewarded by a very
                responsible post — nothing less than the direction of the general police supervision
                over Europe. And it was then, and then only, when taking in hand the perfecting of
                the service which watches the revolutionist activities abroad, that he thought again
                of Mr. Razumov. He saw great possibilities of special usefulness in that uncommon
                young man on whom he had a hold already, with his peculiar temperament, his
                unsettled mind and shaken conscience, a struggling in the toils of a false position.
                . . . It was as if the revolutionists themselves had put into his hand that tool so
                much finer than the common base instruments, so perfectly fitted, if only vested
                with sufficient credit, to penetrate into places inaccessible to common informers.
                Providential! Providential! And Prince K— — taken into the secret, was ready enough
                to adopt that mystical view too. “It will be necessary, though, to make a career for
                him afterwards,” he had stipulated anxiously. “Oh! absolutely. We shall make that
                our affair,” Mikulin had agreed. Prince K——‘s mysticism was of an artless kind; but
                Councillor Mikulin was astute enough for two.</p>

            <p>Things and men have always a certain sense, a certain side by which they must be got
                hold of if one wants to obtain a solid grasp and a perfect command. The power of
                Councillor Mikulin consisted in the ability to seize upon that sense, that side in
                the men he used. It did not matter to him what it was — vanity, despair, love, hate,
                greed, intelligent pride or stupid conceit, it was all one to him as long as the man
                could be made to serve. The obscure, unrelated young student Razumov, in the moment
                of great moral loneliness, was allowed to feel that he was an object of interest to
                a small group of people of high position. Prince K—— was persuaded to intervene
                personally, and on a certain occasion gave way to a manly emotion which, all
                unexpected as it was, quite upset Mr. Razumov. The sudden embrace of that man,
                agitated by his loyalty to a throne and by suppressed paternal affection, was a
                revelation to Mr. Razumov of something within his own breast.</p>

            <p>“So that was it!” he exclaimed to himself. A sort of contemptuous tenderness softened
                the young man’s grim view of his position as he reflected upon that agitated
                interview with Prince K——. This simpleminded, worldly ex-Guardsman and senator whose
                soft grey official whiskers had brushed against his cheek, his aristocratic and
                convinced father, was he a whit less estimable or more absurd than that
                famine-stricken, fanatical revolutionist, the red-nosed student?</p>

            <p>And there was some pressure, too, besides the persuasiveness. Mr. Razumov was always
                being made to feel that he had committed himself. There was no getting away from
                that feeling, from that soft, unanswerable, “Where to?” of Councillor Mikulin. But
                no susceptibilities were ever hurt. It was to be a dangerous mission to Geneva for
                obtaining, at a critical moment, absolutely reliable information from a very
                inaccessible quarter of the inner revolutionary circle. There were indications that
                a very serious plot was being matured. . . . The repose indispensable to a great
                country was at stake. . . . A great scheme of orderly reforms would be endangered.
                . . . The highest personages in the land were patriotically uneasy, and so on. In
                short, Councillor Mikulin knew what to say. This skill is to be inferred clearly
                from the mental and psychological self-confession, self-analysis of Mr. Razumov’s
                written journal — the pitiful resource of a young man who had near him no trusted
                intimacy, no natural affection to turn to.</p>

            <p>How all this preliminary work was concealed from observation need not be recorded.
                The expedient of the oculist gives a sufficient instance. Councillor Mikulin was
                resourceful, and the task not very difficult. Any fellow-student, even the red-nosed
                one, was perfectly welcome to see Mr. Razumov entering a private house to consult an
                oculist. Ultimate success depended solely on the revolutionary self-delusion which
                credited Razumov with a mysterious complicity in the Haldin affair. To be
                compromised in it was credit enough-and it was their own doing. It was precisely
                    <hi>that</hi> which stamped Mr. Razumov as a providential man, wide as poles
                apart from the usual type of agent for “European supervision.”</p>

            <p>And it was <hi>that</hi> which the Secretariat set itself the task to foster by a
                course of calculated and false indiscretions.</p>

            <p>It came at last to this, that one evening Mr. Razumov was unexpectedly called upon by
                one of the “thinking” students whom formerly, before the Haldin affair, he used to
                meet at various private gatherings; a big fellow with a quiet, unassuming manner and
                a pleasant voice.</p>

            <p>Recognizing his voice raised in the ante-room, “May one come in?” Razumov, lounging
                idly on his couch, jumped up. “Suppose he were coming to stab me?” he thought
                sardonically, and, assuming a green shade over his left eye, said in a severe tone,
                “Come in.”</p>

            <p>The other was embarrassed; hoped he was not intruding.</p>

            <p>“You haven’t been seen for several days, and I’ve wondered.” He coughed a little.
                “Eye better?”</p>

            <p>“Nearly well now.”</p>

            <p>“Good. I won’t stop a minute; but you see I, that is, we — anyway, I have undertaken
                the duty to warn you, Kirylo Sidorovitch, that you are living in false security
                maybe.”</p>

            <p>Razumov sat still with his head leaning on his hand, which nearly concealed the
                unshaded eye.</p>

            <p>“I have that idea, too.”</p>

            <p>“That’s all right, then. Everything seems quiet now, but those people are preparing
                some move of general repression. That’s of course. But it isn’t that I came to tell
                you.” He hitched his chair closer, dropped his voice. “You will be arrested before
                long — we fear.”</p>

            <p>An obscure scribe in the Secretariat had overheard a few words of a certain
                conversation, and had caught a glimpse of a certain report. This intelligence was
                not to be neglected.</p>

            <p>Razumov laughed a little, and his visitor became very anxious.</p>

            <p>“Ah! Kirylo Sidorovitch, this is no laughing matter. They have left you alone for a
                while, but . . .! Indeed, you had better try to leave the country, Kirylo
                Sidorovitch, while there’s yet time.”</p>

            <p>Razumov jumped up and began to thank him for the advice with mocking effusiveness, so
                that the other, colouring up, took himself off with the notion that this mysterious
                Razumov was not a person to be warned or advised by inferior mortals.</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin, informed the next day of the incident, expressed his
                satisfaction. “H’m. Ha! Exactly what was wanted to. . .” and glanced down his
                beard.</p>

            <p>“I conclude,” said Razumov,” that the moment has come for me to start on my
                mission.”</p>

            <p>“The psychological Moment,” Councillor Mikulin insisted softly — very gravely — as if
                awed.</p>

            <p>All the arrangements to give verisimilitude to the appearance of a difficult escape
                were made. Councillor Mikulin did not expect to see Mr. Razumov again before his
                departure. These meetings were a risk, and there was nothing more to settle.</p>

            <p>“We have said everything to each other by now, Kirylo Sidorovitch, “said the high
                official feelingly, pressing Razumov’s hand with that unreserved heartiness a
                Russian can convey in his manner. “There is nothing obscure between us. And I will
                tell you what! I consider myself fortunate in having — h’m — your . . . .”</p>

            <p>He glanced down his beard, and, after a moment of thoughtful silence, handed to
                Razumov a half-sheet of notepaper — an abbreviated note of matters already
                discussed, certain points of inquiry, the line of conduct agreed on, a few hints as
                to personalities, and so on. It was the only compromising document in the case, but,
                as Councillor Mikulin observed, it could be easily destroyed. Mr. Razumov had better
                not see any one now — till on the other side of the frontier, when, of course, it
                will be just that. . . . See and hear and . . . .”</p>

            <p>He glanced down his beard; but when Razumov declared his intention to see one person
                at least before leaving St. Petersburg, Councillor Mikulin failed to conceal a
                sudden uneasiness. The young man’s studious, solitary, and austere existence was
                well known to him. It was the greatest guarantee of fitness. He became deprecatory.
                Had his dear Kirylo Sidorovitch considered whether, in view of such a momentous
                enterprise, it wasn’t really advisable to sacrifice every sentiment . . . .</p>

            <p>Razumov interrupted the remonstrance scornfully. It was not a young woman, it was a
                young fool he wished to see for a certain purpose. Councillor Mikulin was relieved,
                but surprised.</p>

            <p>“Ah! And what for — precisely?”</p>

            <p>“For the sake of improving the aspect of verisimilitude,” said Razumov curtly, in a
                desire to affirm his independence. “I must be trusted in what I do.”</p>

            <p>Councillor Mikulin gave way tactfully, murmuring, “Oh, certainly, certainly. Your
                judgment. . .”</p>

            <p>And with another handshake they parted.</p>

            <p>The fool of whom Mr. Razumov had thought was the rich and festive student known as
                madcap Kostia. Feather-headed, loquacious, excitable, one could make certain of his
                utter and complete indiscretion. But that riotous youth, when reminded by Razumov of
                his offers of service some time ago, passed from his usual elation into boundless
                dismay.</p>

            <p>“Oh, Kirylo Sidorovitch, my dearest friend — my saviour — what shall I do? I’ve blown
                last night every rouble I had from my dad the other day. Can’t you give me till
                Thursday? I shall rush round to all the usurers I know. . . . No, of course, you
                can’t! Don’t look at me like that. What shall I do? No use asking the old man. I
                tell you he’s given me a fistful of big notes three days ago. Miserable wretch that
                I am.”</p>

            <p>He wrung his hands in despair. Impossible to confide in the old man. “They” had given
                him a decoration, a cross on the neck only last year, and he had been cursing the
                modern tendencies ever since. Just then he would see all the intellectuals in Russia
                hanged in a row rather than part with a single rouble.</p>

            <p>“Kirylo Sidorovitch, wait a moment. Don’t despise me. I have it. I’ll, yes — I’ll do
                it — I’ll break into his desk. There’s no help for it. I know the drawer where he
                keeps his plunder, and I can buy a chisel on my way home. He will be terribly upset,
                but, you know, the dear old duffer really loves me. He’ll have to get over it — and
                I, too. Kirylo, my dear soul, if you can only wait for a few hours-till this evening
                — I shall steal all the blessed lot I can lay my hands on! You doubt me! Why? You’ve
                only to say the word.”</p>

            <p>“Steal, by all means,” said Razumov, fixing him stonily.</p>

            <p>“To the devil with the ten commandments!” cried the other, with the greatest
                animation. “It’s the new future now.”</p>

            <p>But when he entered Razumov’s room late in the evening it was with an unaccustomed
                soberness of manner, almost solemnly.</p>

            <p>“It’s done,” he said.</p>

            <p>Razumov sitting bowed, his clasped hands hanging between his knees, shuddered at the
                familiar sound of these words. Kostia deposited slowly in the circle of lamplight a
                small brown-paper parcel tied with a piece of string.</p>

            <p>“As I’ve said — all I could lay my hands on. The old boy’ll think the end of the
                world has come.” Razumov nodded from the couch, and contemplated the hare-brained
                fellow’s gravity with a feeling of malicious pleasure.</p>

            <p>“I’ve made my little sacrifice,” sighed mad Kostia. “And I’ve to thank you, Kirylo
                Sidorovitch, for the opportunity.”</p>

            <p>“It has cost you something?”</p>

            <p>“Yes, it has. You see, the dear old duffer really loves me. He’ll be hurt.”</p>

            <p>“And you believe all they tell you of the new future and the sacred will of the
                people?”</p>

            <p>“Implicitly. I would give my life. . . . Only, you see, I am like a pig at a trough.
                I am no good. It’s my nature.”</p>

            <p>Razumov, lost in thought, had forgotten his existence till the youth’s voice,
                entreating him to fly without loss of time, roused him unpleasantly.</p>

            <p>“All right. Well — good-bye.”</p>

            <p>“I am not going to leave you till I’ve seen you out of St. Petersburg,” declared
                Kostia unexpectedly, with calm determination. “You can’t refuse me that now. For
                God’s sake, Kirylo, my soul, the police may be here any moment, and when they get
                you they’ll immure you somewhere for ages — till your hair turns grey. I have down
                there the best trotter of dad’s stables and a light sledge. We shall do thirty miles
                before the moon sets, and find some roadside station . . . .”</p>

            <p>Razumov looked up amazed. The journey was decided — unavoidable. He had fixed the
                next day for his departure on the mission. And now he discovered suddenly that he
                had not believed in it. He had gone about listening, speaking, thinking, planning
                his simulated flight, with the growing conviction that all this was preposterous. As
                if anybody ever did such things! It was like a game of make-believe. And now he was
                amazed! Here was somebody who believed in it with desperate earnestness. “If I don’t
                go now, at once,” thought Razumov, with a start of fear, “I shall never go.” He rose
                without a word, and the anxious Kostia thrust his cap on him, helped him into his
                cloak, or else he would have left the room bareheaded as he stood. He was walking
                out silently when a sharp cry arrested him.</p>

            <p>“Kirylo!”</p>

            <p>“What?” He turned reluctantly in the doorway. Upright, with a stiffly extended arm,
                Kostia, his face set and white, was pointing an eloquent forefinger at the brown
                little packet lying forgotten in the circle of bright light on the table. Razumov
                hesitated, came back for it under the severe eyes of his companion, at whom he tried
                to smile. But the boyish, mad youth was frowning. “It’s a dream,” thought Razumov,
                putting the little parcel into his pocket and descending the stairs; “nobody does
                such things.” The other held him under the arm, whispering of dangers ahead, and of
                what he meant to do in certain contingencies. “Preposterous,” murmured Razumov, as
                he was being tucked up in the sledge. He gave himself up to watching the development
                of the dream with extreme attention. It continued on foreseen lines, inexorably
                logical — the long drive, the wait at the small station sitting by a stove. They did
                not exchange half a dozen words altogether. Kostia, gloomy himself, did not care to
                break the silence. At parting they embraced twice — it had to be done; and then
                Kostia vanished out of the dream.</p>

            <p>When dawn broke, Razumov, very still in a hot, stuffy railway-car full of bedding and
                of sleeping people in all its dimly lighted length, rose quietly, lowered the glass
                a few inches, and flung out on the great plain of snow a small brown-paper parcel.
                Then he sat down again muffled up and motionless. “For the people,” he thought,
                staring out of the window. The great white desert of frozen, hard earth glided past
                his eyes without a sign of human habitation.</p>

            <p>That had been a waking act; and then the dream had him again: Prussia, Saxony,
                Wurtemberg, faces, sights, words — all a dream, observed with an angry, compelled
                attention. Zurich, Geneva — still a dream, minutely followed, wearing one into harsh
                laughter, to fury, to death — with the fear of awakening at the end.</p>
        </div>





        <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="chapter">

            <head>2</head>


            <p>“Perhaps life is just that,” reflected Razumov, pacing to and fro under the trees of
                the little island, all alone with the bronze statue of Rousseau. “A dream and a
                fear.” The dusk deepened. The pages written over and torn out of his notebook were
                the first-fruit of his “mission.” No dream that. They contained the assurance that
                he was on the eve of real discoveries. “I think there is no longer anything in the
                way of my being completely accepted.”</p>

            <p>He had resumed his impressions in those pages, some of the conversations. He even
                went so far as to write: “By the by, I have discovered the personality of that
                terrible N.N. A horrible, paunchy brute. If I hear anything of his future movements
                I shall send a warning.”</p>

            <p>The futility of all this overcame him like a curse. Even then he could not believe in
                the reality of his mission. He looked round despairingly, as if for some way to
                redeem his existence from that unconquerable feeling. He crushed angrily in his hand
                the pages of the notebook. “This must be posted,” he thought.</p>

            <p>He gained the bridge and returned to the north shore, where he remembered having seen
                in one of the narrower streets a little obscure shop stocked with cheap wood
                carvings, its walls lined with extremely dirty cardboard-bound volumes of a small
                circulating library. They sold stationery there, too. A morose, shabby old man dozed
                behind the counter. A thin woman in black, with a sickly face, produced the envelope
                he had asked for without even looking at him. Razumov thought that these people were
                safe to deal with because they no longer cared for anything in the world. He
                addressed the envelope on the counter with the German name of a certain person
                living in Vienna. But Razumov knew that this, his first communication for Councillor
                Mikulin, would find its way to the Embassy there, be copied in cypher by somebody
                trustworthy, and sent on to its destination, all safe, along with the diplomatic
                correspondence. That was the arrangement contrived to cover up the track of the
                information from all unfaithful eyes, from all indiscretions, from all mishaps and
                treacheries. It was to make him safe — absolutely safe.</p>

            <p>He wandered out of the wretched shop and made for the post office. It was then that I
                saw him for the second time that day. He was crossing the Rue Mont Blanc with every
                appearance of an aimless stroller. He did not recognize me, but I made him out at
                some distance. He was very good-looking, I thought, this remarkable friend of Miss
                Haldin’s brother. I watched him go up to the letter-box and then retrace his steps.
                Again he passed me very close, but I am certain he did not see me that time, either.
                He carried his head well up, but he had the expression of a somnambulist struggling
                with the very dream which drives him forth to wander in dangerous places. My
                thoughts reverted to Natalia Haldin, to her mother. He was all that was left to them
                of their son and brother.</p>

            <p>The westerner in me was discomposed. There was something shocking in the expression
                of that face. Had I been myself a conspirator, a Russian political refugee, I could
                have perhaps been able to draw some practical conclusion from this chance glimpse.
                As it was, it only discomposed me strongly, even to the extent of awakening an
                indefinite apprehension in regard to Natalia Haldin. All this is rather
                inexplicable, but such was the origin of the purpose I formed there and then to call
                on these ladies in the evening, after my solitary dinner. It was true that I had met
                Miss Haldin only a few hours before, but Mrs. Haldin herself I had not seen for some
                considerable time. The truth is, I had shirked calling of late.</p>

            <p>Poor Mrs. Haldin! I confess she frightened me a little. She was one of those natures,
                rare enough, luckily, in which one cannot help being interested, because they
                provoke both terror and pity. One dreads their contact for oneself, and still more
                for those one cares for, so clear it is that they are born to suffer and to make
                others suffer, too. It is strange to think that, I won’t say liberty, but the mere
                liberalism of outlook which for us is a matter of words, of ambitions, of votes (and
                if of feeling at all, then of the sort of feeling which leaves our deepest
                affections untouched), may be for other beings very much like ourselves and living
                under the same sky, a heavy trial of fortitude, a matter of tears and anguish and
                blood. Mrs. Haldin had felt the pangs of her own generation. There was that
                enthusiast brother of hers — the officer they shot under Nicholas. A faintly ironic
                resignation is no armour for a vulnerable heart. Mrs. Haldin, struck at through her
                children, was bound to suffer afresh from the past, and to feel the anguish of the
                future. She was of those who do not know how to heal themselves, of those who are
                too much aware of their heart, who, neither cowardly nor selfish, look passionately
                at its wounds — and count the cost.</p>

            <p>Such thoughts as these seasoned my modest, lonely bachelor’s meal. If anybody wishes
                to remark that this was a roundabout way of thinking of Natalia Haldin, I can only
                retort that she was well worth some concern. She had all her life before her. Let it
                be admitted, then, that I was thinking of Natalia Haldin’s life in terms of her
                mother’s character, a manner of thinking about a girl permissible for an old man,
                not too old yet to have become a stranger to pity. There was almost all her youth
                before her; a youth robbed arbitrarily of its natural lightness and joy,
                overshadowed by an un-European despotism; a terribly sombre youth given over to the
                hazards of a furious strife between equally ferocious antagonisms.</p>

            <p>I lingered over my thoughts more than I should have done. One felt so helpless, and
                even worse — so unrelated, in a way. At the last moment I hesitated as to going
                there at all. What was the good?</p>

            <p>The evening was already advanced when, turning into the Boulevard des Philosophes, I
                saw the light in the window at the corner. The blind was down, but I could imagine
                behind it Mrs. Haldin seated in the chair, in her usual attitude, looking out for
                some one, which had lately acquired the poignant quality of mad expectation.</p>

            <p>I thought that I was sufficiently authorized by the light to knock at the door. The
                ladies had not retired as yet. I only hoped they would not have any visitors of
                their own nationality. A broken-down, retired Russian official was to be found there
                sometimes in the evening. He was infinitely forlorn and wearisome by his mere dismal
                presence. I think these ladies tolerated his frequent visits because of an ancient
                friendship with Mr. Haldin, the father, or something of that sort. I made up my mind
                that if I found him prosing away there in his feeble voice I should remain but a
                very few minutes.</p>

            <p>The door surprised me by swinging open before I could ring the bell. I was confronted
                by Miss Haldin, in hat and jacket, obviously on the point of going out. At that
                hour! For the doctor, perhaps?</p>

            <p>Her exclamation of welcome reassured me. It sounded as if I had been the very man she
                wanted to see. My curiosity was awakened. She drew me in, and the faithful Anna, the
                elderly German maid, closed the door, but did not go away afterwards. She remained
                near it as if in readiness to let me out presently. It appeared that Miss Haldin had
                been on the point of going out to find me.</p>

            <p>She spoke in a hurried manner very unusual with her. She would have gone straight and
                rung at Mrs. Ziegler’s door, late as it was, for Mrs. Ziegler’s habits . . . .</p>

            <p>Mrs. Ziegler, the widow of a distinguished professor who was an intimate friend of
                mine, lets me have three rooms out of her very large and fine apartment, which she
                didn’t give up after her husband’s death; but I have my own entrance opening on the
                same landing. It was an arrangement of at least ten years’ standing. I said that I
                was very glad that I had the idea to . . . .</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin made no motion to take off her outdoor things. I observed her heightened
                colour, something pronouncedly resolute in her tone. Did I know where Mr. Razumov
                lived?</p>

            <p>Where Mr. Razumov lived? Mr. Razumov? At this hour — so urgently? I threw my arms up
                in sign of utter ignorance. I had not the slightest idea where he lived. If I could
                have foreseen her question only three hours ago, I might have ventured to ask him on
                the pavement before the new post office building, and possibly he would have told
                me, but very possibly, too, he would have dismissed me rudely to mind my own
                business. And possibly, I thought, remembering that extraordinary hallucined,
                anguished, and absent expression, he might have fallen down in a fit from the shock
                of being spoken to. I said nothing of all this to Miss Haldin, not even mentioning
                that I had a glimpse of the young man so recently. The impression had been so
                extremely unpleasant that I would have been glad to forget it myself.</p>

            <p>“I don’t see where I could make inquiries,” I murmured helplessly. I would have been
                glad to be of use in any way, and would have set off to fetch any man, young or old,
                for I had the greatest confidence in her common sense. “What made you think of
                coming to me for that information?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“It wasn’t exactly for that,” she said, in a low voice. She had the air of some one
                confronted by an unpleasant task.</p>

            <p>“Am I to understand that you must communicate with Mr. Razumov this evening?”</p>

            <p>Natalia Haldin moved her head affirmatively; then, after a glance at the door of the
                drawing-room, said in French —</p>

            <p>“<hi>C’est maman</hi>,” and remained perplexed for a moment. Always serious, not a
                girl to be put out by any imaginary difficulties, my curiosity was suspended on her
                lips, which remained closed for a moment. What was Mr. Razumov’s connexion with this
                mention of her mother? Mrs. Haldin had not been informed of her son’s friend’s
                arrival in Geneva.</p>

            <p>“May I hope to see your mother this evening?” I inquired.</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin extended her hand as if to bar the way.</p>

            <p>“She is in a terrible state of agitation. Oh, you would not he able to detect. . . .
                It’s inward, but I who know mother, I am appalled. I haven’t the courage to face it
                any longer. It’s all my fault; I suppose I cannot play a part; I’ve never before
                hidden anything from mother. There has never been an occasion for anything of that
                sort between us. But you know yourself the reason why I refrained from telling her
                at once of Mr. Razumov’s arrival here. You understand, don’t you? Owing to her
                unhappy state. And — there — I am no actress. My own feelings being strongly
                engaged, I somehow. . . . I don’t know. She noticed something in my manner. She
                thought I was concealing something from her. She noticed my longer absences, and, in
                fact, as I have been meeting Mr. Razumov daily, I used to stay away longer than
                usual when I went out. Goodness knows what suspicions arose in her mind. You know
                that she has not been herself ever since. . . . So this evening she — who has been
                so awfully silent: for weeks-began to talk all at once. She said that she did not
                want to reproach me; that I had my character as she had her own; that she did not
                want to pry into my affairs or even into my thoughts; for her part, she had never
                had anything to conceal from her children . . . cruel things to listen to. And all
                this in her quiet voice, with that poor, wasted face as calm as a stone. It was
                unbearable.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin talked in an undertone and more rapidly than I had ever heard her speak
                before. That in itself was disturbing. The ante-room being strongly lighted, I could
                see under the veil the heightened colour of her face. She stood erect, her left hand
                was resting lightly on a small table. The other hung by her side without stirring.
                Now and then she caught her breath slightly.</p>

            <p>“It was too startling. Just fancy! She thought that I was making preparations to
                leave her without saying anything. I knelt by the side of her chair and entreated
                her to think of what she was saying! She put her hand on my head, but she persists
                in her delusion all the same. She had always thought that she was worthy of her
                children’s confidence, but apparently it was not so. Her son could not trust her
                love nor yet her understanding — and now I was planning to abandon her in the same
                cruel and unjust manner, and so on, and so on. Nothing I could say. . . . It is
                morbid obstinacy. . . . She said that she felt there was something, some change in
                me. . . . If my convictions were calling me away, why this secrecy, as though she
                had been a coward or a weakling not safe to trust? ‘As if my heart could play
                traitor to my children,’ she said. . . . It was hardly to be borne. And she was
                smoothing my head all the time. . . . It was perfectly useless to protest. She is
                ill. Her very soul is . . . .”</p>

            <p>I did not venture to break the silence which fell between us. I looked into her eyes,
                glistening through the veil.</p>

            <p>“I! Changed!” she exclaimed in the same low tone. “My convictions calling me away! It
                was cruel to hear this, because my trouble is that I am weak and cannot see what I
                ought to do. You know that. And to end it all I did a selfish thing. To remove her
                suspicions of myself I told her of Mr. Razumov. It was selfish of me. You know we
                were completely right in agreeing to keep the knowledge away from her. Perfectly
                right. Directly I told her of our poor Victor’s friend being here I saw how right we
                have been. She ought to have been prepared; but in my distress I just blurted it
                out. Mother got terribly excited at once. How long has he been here? What did he
                know, and why did he not come to see us at once, this friend of her Victor? What did
                that mean? Was she not to be trusted even with such memories as there were left of
                her son? . . . Just think how I felt seeing her, white like a sheet, perfectly
                motionless, with her thin hands gripping the arms of the chair. I told her it was
                all my fault.”</p>

            <p>I could imagine the motionless dumb figure of the mother in her chair, there, behind
                the door, near which the daughter was talking to me. The silence in there seemed to
                call aloud for vengeance against an historical fact and the modern instances of its
                working. That view flashed through my mind, but I could not doubt that Miss Haldin
                had had an atrocious time of it. I quite understood when she said that she could not
                face the night upon the impression of that scene. Mrs. Haldin had given way to most
                awful imaginings, to most fantastic and cruel suspicions. All this had to be lulled
                at all costs and without loss of time. It was no shock to me to learn that Miss
                Haldin had said to her, “I will go and bring him here at once.” There was nothing
                absurd in that cry, no exaggeration of sentiment. I was not even doubtful in my
                “Very well, but how?”</p>

            <p>It was perfectly right that she should think of me, but what could I do in my
                ignorance of Mr. Razumov’s quarters.</p>

            <p>“And to think he may be living near by, within a stone’s-throw, perhaps!” she
                exclaimed.</p>

            <p>I doubted it; but I would have gone off cheerfully to fetch him from the other end of
                Geneva. I suppose she was certain of my readiness, since her first thought was to
                come to me. But the service she meant to ask of me really was to accompany her to
                the Chateau Borel.</p>

            <p>I had an unpleasant mental vision of the dark road, of the sombre grounds, and the
                desolately suspicious aspect of that home of necromancy and intrigue and feminist
                adoration. I objected that Madame de S—— most likely would know nothing of what we
                wanted to find out. Neither did I think it likely that the young man would be found
                there. I remembered my glimpse of his face, and somehow gained the conviction that a
                man who looked worse than if he had seen the dead would want to shut himself up
                somewhere where he could be alone. I felt a strange certitude that Mr. Razumov was
                going home when I saw him.</p>

            <p>“It is really of Peter Ivanovitch that I was thinking,” said Miss Haldin quietly.</p>

            <p>Ah! He, of course, would know. I looked at my watch. It was twenty minutes past nine
                only. . . . Still.</p>

            <p>“I would try his hotel, then,” I advised. “He has rooms at the Cosmopolitan,
                somewhere on the top floor.”</p>

            <p>I did not offer to go by myself, simply from mistrust of the reception I should meet
                with. But I suggested the faithful Anna, with a note asking for the information.</p>

            <p>Anna was still waiting by the door at the other end of the room, and we two discussed
                the matter in whispers. Miss Haldin thought she must go herself. Anna was timid and
                slow. Time would be lost in bringing back the answer, and from that point of view it
                was getting late, for it was by no means certain that Mr. Razumov lived near by.</p>

            <p>“If I go myself,” Miss Haldin argued, “I can go straight to him from the hotel. And
                in any case I should have to go out, because I must explain to Mr. Razumov
                personally — prepare him in a way. You have no idea of mother’s state of mind.”</p>

            <p>Her colour came and went. She even thought that both for her mother’s sake and for
                her own it was better that they should not be together for a little time. Anna, whom
                her mother liked, would be at hand.</p>

            <p>“She could take her sewing into the room,” Miss Haldin continued, leading the way to
                the door. Then, addressing in German the maid who opened it before us, “You may tell
                my mother that this gentleman called and is gone with me to find Mr. Razumov. She
                must not be uneasy if I am away for some length of time.”</p>

            <p>We passed out quickly into the street, and she took deep breaths of the cool night
                air. “I did not even ask you,” she murmured.</p>

            <p>“I should think not,” I said, with a laugh. The manner of my reception by the great
                feminist could not be considered now. That he would be annoyed to see me, and
                probably treat me to some solemn insolence, I had no doubt, but I supposed that he
                would not absolutely dare to throw me out. And that was all I cared for. “Won’t you
                take my arm?” I asked.</p>

            <p>She did so in silence, and neither of us said anything worth recording till I let her
                go first into the great hall of the hotel. It was brilliantly lighted, and with a
                good many people lounging about.</p>

            <p>“I could very well go up there without you,” I suggested.</p>

            <p>“I don’t like to be left waiting in this place,” she said in a low voice.</p>

            <p>“I will come too.”</p>

            <p>I led her straight to the lift then. At the top floor the attendant directed us to
                the right: “End of the corridor.”</p>

            <p>The walls were white, the carpet red, electric lights blazed in profusion, and the
                emptiness, the silence, the closed doors all alike and numbered, made me think of
                the perfect order of some severely luxurious model penitentiary on the solitary
                confinement principle. Up there under the roof of that enormous pile for housing
                travellers no sound of any kind reached us, the thick crimson felt muffled our
                footsteps completely. We hastened on, not looking at each other till we found
                ourselves before the very last door of that long passage. Then our eyes met, and we
                stood thus for a moment lending ear to a faint murmur of voices inside.</p>

            <p>“I suppose this is it,” I whispered unnecessarily. I saw Miss Haldin’s lips move
                without a sound, and after my sharp knock the murmur of voices inside ceased. A
                profound stillness lasted for a few seconds, and then the door was brusquely opened
                by a short, black-eyed woman in a red blouse, with a great lot of nearly white hair,
                done up negligently in an untidy and unpicturesque manner. Her thin, jetty eyebrows
                were drawn together. I learned afterwards with interest that she was the famous — or
                the notorious — Sophia Antonovna, but I was struck then by the quaint
                Mephistophelian character of her inquiring glance, because it was so curiously
                evil-less, so — I may say — un-devilish. It got softened still more as she looked up
                at Miss Haldin, who stated, in her rich, even voice, her wish to see Peter
                Ivanovitch for a moment.</p>

            <p>“I am Miss Haldin,” she added.</p>

            <p>At this, with her brow completely smoothed out now, but without a word in answer, the
                woman in the red blouse walked away to a sofa and sat down, leaving the door wide
                open.</p>

            <p>And from the sofa, her hands lying on her lap, she watched us enter, with her black,
                glittering eyes.</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin advanced into the middle of the room; I, faithful to my part of mere
                attendant, remained by the door after closing it behind me. The room, quite a large
                one, but with a low ceiling, was scantily furnished, and an electric bulb with a
                porcelain shade pulled low down over a big table (with a very large map spread on
                it) left its distant parts in a dim, artificial twilight. Peter Ivanovitch was not
                to be seen, neither was Mr. Razumov present. But, on the sofa, near Sophia
                Antonovna, a bony-faced man with a goatee beard leaned forward with his hands on his
                knees, staring hard with a kindly expression. In a remote corner a broad, pale face
                and a bulky shape could be made out, uncouth, and as if insecure on the low seat on
                which it rested. The only person known to me was little Julius Laspara, who seemed
                to have been poring over the map, his feet twined tightly round the chair-legs. He
                got down briskly and bowed to Miss Haldin, looking absurdly like a hooknosed boy
                with a beautiful false pepper-and-salt beard. He advanced, offering his seat, which
                Miss Haldin declined. She had only come in for a moment to say a few words to Peter
                Ivanovitch.</p>

            <p>His high-pitched voice became painfully audible in the room.</p>

            <p>“Strangely enough, I was thinking of you this very afternoon, Natalia Victorovna. I
                met Mr. Razumov. I asked him to write me an article on anything he liked. You could
                translate it into English — with such a teacher.”</p>

            <p>He nodded complimentarily in my direction. At the name of Razumov an indescribable
                sound, a sort of feeble squeak, as of some angry small animal, was heard in the
                corner occupied by the man who seemed much too large for the chair on which he sat.
                I did not hear what Miss Haldin said. Laspara spoke again.</p>

            <p>“It’s time to do something, Natalia Victorovna. But I suppose you have your own
                ideas. Why not write something yourself? Suppose you came to see us soon? We could
                talk it over. Any advice . . . .</p>

            <p>Again I did not catch Miss Haldin’s words. It was Laspara’s voice once more.</p>

            <p>“Peter Ivanovitch? He’s retired for a moment into the other room. We are all waiting
                for him.” The great man, entering at that moment, looked bigger, taller, quite
                imposing in a long dressing-gown of some dark stuff. It descended in straight lines
                down to his feet. He suggested a monk or a prophet, a robust figure of same
                desert-dweller — something Asiatic; and the dark glasses in conjunction with this
                costume made him more mysterious than ever in the subdued light.</p>

            <p>Little Laspara went back to his chair to look at the map, the only brilliantly lit
                object in the room. Even from my distant position by the door I could make out, by
                the shape of the blue part representing the water, that it was a map of the Baltic
                provinces. Peter Ivanovitch exclaimed slightly, advancing towards Miss Haldin,
                checked himself on perceiving me, very vaguely no doubt; and peered with his dark,
                bespectacled stare. He must have recognized me by my grey hair, because, with a
                marked shrug of his broad shoulders, he turned to Miss Haldin in benevolent
                indulgence. He seized her hand in his thick cushioned palm, and put his other big
                paw over it like a lid.</p>

            <p>While those two standing in the middle of the floor were exchanging a few inaudible
                phrases no one else moved in the room: Laspara, with his back to us, kneeling on the
                chair, his elbows propped on the big-scale map, the shadowy enormity in the corner,
                the frankly staring man with the goatee on the sofa, the woman in the red blouse by
                his side — not one of them stirred. I suppose that really they had no time, for Miss
                Haldin withdrew her hand immediately from Peter Ivanovitch and before I was ready
                for her was moving to the door. A disregarded Westerner, I threw it open hurriedly
                and followed her out, my last glance leaving them all motionless in their varied
                poses: Peter Ivanovitch alone standing up, with his dark glasses like an enormous
                blind teacher, and behind him the vivid patch of light on the coloured map, pored
                over by the diminutive Laspara.</p>

            <p>Later on, much later on, at the time of the newspaper rumours (they were vague and
                soon died out) of an abortive military conspiracy in Russia, I remembered the
                glimpse I had of that motionless group with its central figure. No details ever came
                out, but it was known that the revolutionary parties abroad had given their
                assistance, had sent emissaries in advance, that even money was found to dispatch a
                steamer with a cargo of arms and conspirators to invade the Baltic provinces. And
                while my eyes scanned the imperfect disclosures (in which the world was not much
                interested) I thought that the old, settled Europe had been given in my person
                attending that Russian girl something like a glimpse behind the scenes. A short,
                strange glimpse on the top floor of a great hotel of all places in the world: the
                great man himself; the motionless great bulk in the corner of the slayer of spies
                and gendarmes; Yakovlitch, the veteran of ancient terrorist campaigns; the woman,
                with her hair as white as mine and the lively black eyes, all in a mysterious
                half-light, with the strongly lighted map of Russia on the table. The woman I had
                the opportunity to see again. As we were waiting for the lift she came hurrying
                along the corridor, with her eyes fastened on Miss Haldin’s face, and drew her aside
                as if for a confidential communication. It was not long. A few words only.</p>

            <p>Going down in the lift, Natalia Haldin did not break the silence. It was only when
                out of the hotel and as we moved along the quay in the fresh darkness spangled by
                the quay lights, reflected in the black water of the little port on our left hand,
                and with lofty piles of hotels on our right, that she spoke.</p>

            <p>“That was Sophia Antonovna — you know the woman? . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes, I know — the famous . . . .”</p>

            <p>“The same. It appears that after we went out Peter Ivanovitch told them why I had
                come. That was the reason she ran out after us. She named herself to me, and then
                she said, ‘You are the sister of a brave man who shall be remembered. You may see
                better times.’ I told her I hoped to see the time when all this would be forgotten,
                even if the name of my brother were to be forgotten too. Something moved me to say
                that, but you understand?”</p>

            <p>“Yes,” I said. “You think of the era of concord and justice.”</p>

            <p>“Yes. There is too much hate and revenge in that work. It must be done. It is a
                sacrifice — and so let it be all the greater. Destruction is the work of anger. Let
                the tyrants and the slayers be forgotten together, and only the reconstructors be
                remembered.’’</p>

            <p>“And did Sophia Antonovna agree with you?” I asked sceptically.</p>

            <p>“She did not say anything except, ‘It is good for you to believe in love.’ I should
                think she understood me. Then she asked me if I hoped to see Mr. Razumov presently.
                I said I trusted I could manage to bring him to see my mother this evening, as my
                mother had learned of his being here and was morbidly impatient to learn if he could
                tell us something of Victor. He was the only friend of my brother we knew of, and a
                great intimate. She said, ‘Oh! Your brother — yes. Please tell Mr. Razumov that I
                have made public the story which came to me from St. Petersburg. It concerns your
                brother’s arrest,’ she added. ‘He was betrayed by a man of the people who has since
                hanged himself. Mr. Razumov will explain it all to you. I gave him the full
                information this afternoon. And please tell Mr. Razumov that Sophia Antonovna sends
                him her greetings. I am going away early in the morning — far away.’”</p>

            <p>And Miss Haldin added, after a moment of silence-” I was so moved by what I heard so
                unexpectedly that I simply could not speak to you before. . . . A man of the people!
                Oh, our poor people!”</p>

            <p>She walked slowly, as if tired out suddenly. Her head drooped; from the windows of a
                building with terraces and balconies came the banal sound of hotel music; before the
                low mean portals of the Casino two red posters blazed under the electric lamps, with
                a cheap provincial effect. — and the emptiness of the quays, the desert aspect of
                the streets, had an air of hypocritical respectability and of inexpressible
                dreariness.</p>

            <p>I had taken for granted she had obtained the address, and let myself be guided by
                her. On the Mont Blanc bridge, where a few dark figures seemed lost in the wide and
                long perspective defined by the lights, she said —</p>

            <p>“It isn’t very far from our house. I somehow thought it couldn’t be. The address is
                Rue de Carouge. I think it must be one of those big new houses for artisans.”</p>

            <p>She took my arm confidingly, familiarly, and accelerated her pace. There was
                something primitive in our proceedings. We did not think of the resources of
                civilization. A late tramcar overtook us; a row of <hi>fiacres</hi> stood by the
                railing of the gardens. It never entered our heads to make use of these conveyances.
                She was too hurried, perhaps, and as to myself — well, she had taken my arm
                confidingly. As we were ascending the easy incline of the Corraterie, all the shops
                shuttered and no light in any of the windows (as if all the mercenary population had
                fled at the end of the day), she said tentatively —</p>

            <p>“I could run in for a moment to have a look at mother. It would not be much out of
                the way.”</p>

            <p>I dissuaded her. If Mrs. Haldin really expected to see Razumov that night it would
                have been unwise to show herself without him. The sooner we got hold of the young
                man and brought him along to calm her mother’s agitation the better. She assented to
                my reasoning, and we crossed diagonally the Place de Theatre, bluish grey with its
                floor of slabs of stone, under the electric light, and the lonely equestrian statue
                all black in the middle. In the Rue de Carouge we were in the poorer quarters and
                approaching the outskirts of the town. Vacant building plots alternated with high,
                new houses. At the corner of a side street the crude light of a whitewashed shop
                fell into the night, fan-like, through a wide doorway. One could see from a distance
                the inner wall with its scantily furnished shelves, and the deal counter painted
                brown. That was the house. Approaching it along the dark stretch of a fence of
                tarred planks, we saw the narrow pallid face of the cut angle, five single windows
                high, without a gleam in them, and crowned by the heavy shadow of a jutting roof
                slope.</p>

            <p>“We must inquire in the shop,” Miss Haldin directed me.</p>

            <p>A sallow, thinly whiskered man, wearing a dingy white collar and a frayed tie, laid
                down a newspaper, and, leaning familiarly on both elbows far over the bare counter,
                answered that the person I was inquiring for was indeed his <hi>locataire</hi> on
                the third floor, but that for the moment he was out.</p>

            <p>“For the moment,” I repeated, after a glance at Miss Haldin. “Does this mean that you
                expect him back at once?”</p>

            <p>He was very gentle, with ingratiating eyes and soft lips. He smiled faintly as though
                he knew all about everything. Mr. Razumov, after being absent all day, had returned
                early in the evening. He was very surprised about half an hour or a little more
                since to see him come down again. Mr. Razumov left his key, and in the course of
                some words which passed between them had remarked that he was going out because he
                needed air.</p>

            <p>From behind the bare counter he went on smiling at us, his head held between his
                hands. Air. Air. But whether that meant a long or a short absence it was difficult
                to say. The night was very close, certainly.</p>

            <p>After a pause, his ingratiating eyes turned to the door, he added —</p>

            <p>“The storm shall drive him in.”</p>

            <p>“There’s going to be a storm?” I asked.</p>

            <p>“Why, yes!”</p>

            <p>As if to confirm his words we heard a very distant, deep rumbling noise.</p>

            <p>Consulting Miss Haldin by a glance, I saw her so reluctant to give up her quest that
                I asked the shopkeeper, in case Mr. Razumov came home within half an hour, to beg
                him to remain downstairs in the shop. We would look in again presently.</p>

            <p>For all answer he moved his head imperceptibly. The approval of Miss Haldin was
                expressed by her silence. We walked slowly down the street, away from the town; the
                low garden walls of the modest villas doomed to demolition were overhung by the
                boughs of trees and masses of foliage, lighted from below by gas lamps. The violent
                and monotonous noise of the icy waters of the Arve falling over a low dam swept
                towards us with a chilly draught of air across a great open space, where a double
                line of lamp-lights outlined a street as yet without houses. But on the other shore,
                overhung by the awful blackness of the thunder-cloud, a solitary dim light seemed to
                watch us with a weary stare. When we had strolled as far as the bridge, I said —</p>

            <p>“We had better get back . . . .”</p>

            <p>In the shop the sickly man was studying his smudgy newspaper, now spread out largely
                on the counter. He just raised his head when I looked in and shook it negatively,
                pursing up his lips. I rejoined Miss Haldin outside at once, and we moved off at a
                brisk pace. She remarked that she would send Anna with a note the first thing in the
                morning. I respected her taciturnity, silence being perhaps the best way to show my
                concern.</p>

            <p>The semi-rural street we followed on our return changed gradually to the usual town
                thoroughfare, broad and deserted. We did not meet four people altogether, and the
                way seemed interminable, because my companion’s natural anxiety had communicated
                itself sympathetically to me. At last we turned into the Boulevard des Philosophes,
                more wide, more empty, more dead — the very desolation of slumbering respectability.
                At the sight of the two lighted windows, very conspicuous from afar, I had the
                mental vision of Mrs. Haldin in her armchair keeping a dreadful, tormenting vigil
                under the evil spell of an arbitrary rule: a victim of tyranny and revolution, a
                sight at once cruel and absurd.</p>

            <head>3</head>


            <p>“You will come in for a moment?” said Natalia Haldin.</p>

            <p>I demurred on account of the late hour. “You know mother likes you so much,” she
                insisted.</p>

            <p>“I will just come in to hear how your mother is.”</p>

            <p>She said, as if to herself, “I don’t even know whether she will believe that I could
                not find Mr. Razumov, since she has taken it into her head that I am concealing
                something from her. You may be able to persuade her . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Your mother may mistrust me too,” I observed.</p>

            <p>“You! Why? What could you have to conceal from her? You are not a Russian nor a
                conspirator.”</p>

            <p>I felt profoundly my European remoteness, and said nothing, but I made up my mind to
                play my part of helpless spectator to the end. The distant rolling of thunder in the
                valley of the Rhone was coming nearer to the sleeping town of prosaic virtues and
                universal hospitality. We crossed the street opposite the great dark gateway, and
                Miss Haldin rang at the door of the apartment. It was opened almost instantly, as if
                the elderly maid had been waiting in the ante-room for our return. Her flat
                physiognomy had an air of satisfaction. The gentleman was there, she declared, while
                closing the door.</p>

            <p>Neither of us understood. Miss Haldin turned round brusquely to her. “Who?”</p>

            <p>“Herr Razumov,” she explained.</p>

            <p>She had heard enough of our conversation before we left to know why her young
                mistress was going out. Therefore, when the gentleman gave his name at the door, she
                admitted him at once.</p>

            <p>“No one could have foreseen that,” Miss Haldin murmured, with her serious grey eyes
                fixed upon mine. And, remembering the expression of the young man’s face seen not
                much more than four hours ago, the look of a haunted somnambulist, I wondered with a
                sort of awe.</p>

            <p>“You asked my mother first?” Miss Haldin inquired of the maid.</p>

            <p>“No. I announced the gentleman,” she answered, surprised at our troubled faces.</p>

            <p>“Still,” I said in an undertone, “your mother was prepared.”</p>

            <p>“Yes. But he has no idea . . . .”</p>

            <p>It seemed to me she doubted his tact. To her question how long the gentleman had been
                with her mother, the maid told us that Der Herr had been in the drawing-room no more
                than a short quarter of an hour.</p>

            <p>She waited a moment, then withdrew, looking a little scared. Miss Haldin gazed at me
                in silence.</p>

            <p>“As things have turned out,” I said, “you happen to know exactly what your brother’s
                friend has to tell your mother. And surely after that . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Yes,” said Natalia Haldin slowly. “ I only wonder, as I was not here when he came,
                if it wouldn’t be better not to interrupt now.”</p>

            <p>We remained silent, and I suppose we both strained our ears, but no sound reached us
                through the closed door. The features of Miss Haldin expressed a painful
                irresolution; she made a movement as if to go in, but checked herself. She had heard
                footsteps on the other side of the door. It came open, and Razumov, without pausing,
                stepped out into the ante-room. The fatigue of that day and the struggle with
                himself had changed him so much that I would have hesitated to recognize that face
                which, only a few hours before, when he brushed against me in front of the post
                office, had been startling enough but quite different. It had been not so livid
                then, and its eyes not so sombre. They certainly looked more sane now, but there was
                upon them the shadow of something consciously evil.</p>

            <p>I speak of that, because, at first, their glance fell on me, though without any sort
                of recognition or even comprehension. I was simply in the line of his stare. I don’t
                know if he had heard the bell or expected to see anybody. He was going out, I
                believe, and I do not think that he saw Miss Haldin till she advanced towards him a
                step or two. He disregarded the hand she put out.</p>

            <p>“It’s you, Natalia Victorovna. . . . Perhaps you are surprised . . . at this late
                hour. But, you see, I remembered our conversations in that garden. I thought really
                it was your wish that I should — without loss of time . . . so I came. No other
                reason. Simply to tell . . . .”</p>

            <p>He spoke with difficulty. I noticed that, and remembered his declaration to the man
                in the shop that he was going out because he “needed air.” If that was his object,
                then it was clear that he had miserably failed. With downcast eyes and lowered head
                he made an effort to pick up the strangled phrase.</p>

            <p>“To tell what I have heard myself only to-day — to-day . . . .”</p>

            <p>Through the door he had not closed I had a view of the drawing-room. It was lighted
                only by a shaded lamp — Mrs. Haldin’s eyes could not support either gas or
                electricity. It was a comparatively big room, and in contrast with the strongly
                lighted ante-room its length was lost in semi-transparent gloom backed by heavy
                shadows; and on that ground I saw the motionless figure of Mrs. Haldin, inclined
                slightly forward, with a pale hand resting on the arm of the chair.</p>

            <p>She did not move. With the window before her she had no longer that attitude
                suggesting expectation. The blind was down; and outside there was only the night sky
                harbouring a thunder-cloud, and the town indifferent and hospitable in its cold,
                almost scornful, toleration — a respectable town of refuge to which all these
                sorrows and hopes were nothing. Her white head was bowed.</p>

            <p>The thought that the real drama of autocracy is not played on the great stage of
                politics came to me as, fated to be a spectator, I had this other glimpse behind the
                scenes, something more profound than the words and gestures of the public play. I
                had the certitude that this mother, refused in her heart to give her son up after
                all. It was more than Rachel’s inconsolable mourning, it was something deeper, more
                inaccessible in its frightful tranquillity. Lost in the ill-defined mass of the
                high-backed chair, her white, inclined profile suggested the contemplation of
                something in her lap, as though a beloved head were resting there.</p>

            <p>I had this glimpse behind the scenes, and then Miss Haldin, passing by the young man,
                shut the door. It was not done without hesitation. For a moment I thought that she
                would go to her mother, but she sent in only an anxious glance. Perhaps if Mrs.
                Haldin had moved . . . but no. There was in the immobility of that bloodless face
                the dreadful aloofness of suffering without remedy.</p>

            <p>Meantime the young man kept his eyes fixed on the floor. The thought that he would
                have to repeat the story he had told already was intolerable to him. He had expected
                to find the two women together. And then, he had said to himself, it would be over
                for all time — for all time. “It’s lucky I don’t believe in another world,” he had
                thought cynically.</p>

            <p>Alone in his room after having posted his secret letter, he had regained a certain
                measure of composure by writing in his secret diary. He was aware of the danger of
                that strange self-indulgence. He alludes to it himself, but he could not refrain. It
                calmed him — it reconciled him to his existence. He sat there scribbling by the
                light of a solitary candle, till it occurred to him that having heard the
                explanation of Haldin’s arrest, as put forward by Sophia Antonovna, it behoved him
                to tell these ladies himself. They were certain to hear the tale through some other
                channel, and then his abstention would look strange, not only to the mother and
                sister of Haldin, but to other people also. Having come to this conclusion, he did
                not discover in himself any marked reluctance to face the necessity, and very soon
                an anxiety to be done with it began to torment him. He looked at his watch. No; it
                was not absolutely too late.</p>

            <p>The fifteen minutes with Mrs. Haldin were like the revenge of the unknown: that white
                face, that weak, distinct voice; that head, at first turned to him eagerly, then,
                after a while, bowed again and motionless — in the dim, still light of the room in
                which his words which he tried to subdue resounded so loudly — had troubled him like
                some strange discovery. And there seemed to be a secret obstinacy in that sorrow,
                something he could not understand; at any rate, something he had not expected. Was
                it hostile? But it did not matter. Nothing could touch him now; in the eyes of the
                revolutionists there was now no shadow on his past. The phantom of Haldin had been
                indeed walked over, was left behind lying powerless and passive on the pavement
                covered with snow. And this was the phantom’s mother consumed with grief and white
                as a ghost. He had felt a pitying surprise. But that, of course, was of no
                importance. Mothers did not matter. He could not shake off the poignant impression
                of that silent, quiet, white-haired woman, but a sort of sternness crept into his
                thoughts. These were the consequences. Well, what of it? “ Am I then on a bed of
                roses?” he had exclaimed to himself, sitting at some distance with his eyes fixed
                upon that figure of sorrow. He had said all he had to say to her, and when he had
                finished she had not uttered a word. She had turned away her head while he was
                speaking. The silence which had fallen on his last words had lasted for five minutes
                or more. What did it mean? Before its incomprehensible character he became conscious
                of anger in his stern mood, the old anger against Haldin reawakened by the
                contemplation of Haldin’s mother. And was it not something like enviousness which
                gripped his heart, as if of a privilege denied to him alone of all the men that had
                ever passed through this world? It was the other who had attained to repose and yet
                continued to exist in the affection of that mourning old woman, in the thoughts of
                all these people posing for lovers of humanity. It was impossible to get rid of him.
                “It’s myself whom I have given up to destruction,” thought Razumov. “He has induced
                me to do it. I can’t shake him off.”</p>

            <p>Alarmed by that discovery, he got up and strode out of the silent, dim room with its
                silent old woman in the chair, that mother! He never looked back. It was frankly a
                flight. But on opening the door he saw his retreat cut off: There was the sister. He
                had never forgotten the sister, only he had not expected to see her then — or ever
                any more, perhaps. Her presence in the ante-room was as unforeseen as the apparition
                of her brother had been. Razumov gave a start as though he had discovered himself
                cleverly trapped. He tried to smile, but could not manage it, and lowered his eyes.
                “Must I repeat that silly story now?” he asked himself, and felt a sinking
                sensation. Nothing solid had passed his lips since the day before, but he was not in
                a state to analyse the origins of his weakness. He meant to take up his hat and
                depart with as few words as possible, but Miss Haldin’s swift movement to shut the
                door took him by surprise. He half turned after her, but without raising his eyes,
                passively, just as a feather might stir in the disturbed air. The next moment she
                was back in the place she had started from, with another half-turn on his part, so
                that they came again into the same relative positions.</p>

            <p>“Yes, yes,” she said hurriedly. “I am very grateful to you, Kirylo Sidorovitch, for
                coming at once — like this . . . . Only, I wish I had. . . . Did mother tell
                you?”</p>

            <p>“I wonder what she could have told me that I did not know before,” he said, obviously
                to himself, but perfectly audible. “Because I always did know it,” he added louder,
                as if in despair.</p>

            <p>He hung his head. He had such a strong sense of Natalia Haldin’s presence that to
                look at her he felt would be a relief. It was she who had been haunting him now. He
                had suffered that persecution ever since she had suddenly appeared before him in the
                garden of the Villa Borel with an extended hand and the name of her brother on her
                lips. . . . The ante-room had a row of hooks on the wall nearest to the outer door,
                while against the wall opposite there stood a small dark table and one chair. The
                paper, bearing a very faint design, was all but white. The light of an electric bulb
                high up under the ceiling searched that clear square box into its four bare corners,
                crudely, without shadows — a strange stage for an obscure drama.</p>

            <p>“What do you mean?” asked Miss Haldin. “What is it that you knew always?”</p>

            <p>He raised his face, pale, full of unexpressed suffering. But that look in his eyes of
                dull, absent obstinacy, which struck and surprised everybody he was talking to,
                began to pass way. It was as though he were coming to himself in the awakened
                consciousness of that marvellous harmony of feature, of lines, of glances, of voice,
                which made of the girl before him a being so rare, outside, and, as it were, above
                the common notion of beauty. He looked at her so long that she coloured
                slightly.</p>

            <p>“What is it that you knew?” she repeated vaguely.</p>

            <p>That time he managed to smile.</p>

            <p>“Indeed, if it had not been for a word of greeting or two, I would doubt whether your
                mother was aware at all of my existence. You understand?”</p>

            <p>Natalia Haldin nodded; her hands moved slightly by her side.</p>

            <p>“Yes. Is it not heart-breaking? She has not shed a tear yet — not a single tear.”</p>

            <p>“Not a tear! And you, Natalia Victorovna? You have been able to cry?”</p>

            <p>“I have. And then I am young enough, Kirylo Sidorovitch, to believe in the future.
                But when I see my mother so terribly distracted, I almost forget everything. I ask
                myself whether one should feel proud — or only resigned. We had such a lot of people
                coming to see us. There were utter strangers who wrote asking for permission to call
                to present their respects. It was impossible to keep our door shut for ever. You
                know that Peter Ivanovitch himself. . . . Oh yes, there was much sympathy, but there
                were persons who exulted openly at that death. Then, when I was left alone with poor
                mother, all this seemed so wrong in spirit, something not worth the price she is
                paying for it. But directly I heard you were here in Geneva, Kirylo Sidorovitch, I
                felt that you were the only person who could assist me . . . .”</p>

            <p>“In comforting a bereaved mother? Yes!” he broke in in a manner which made her open
                her clear unsuspecting eyes. “But there is a question of fitness. Has this occurred
                to you?”</p>

            <p>There was a breathlessness in his utterance which contrasted with the monstrous hint
                of mockery in his intention.</p>

            <p>“Why!” whispered Natalia Haldin with feeling. “Who more fit than you?”</p>

            <p>He had a convulsive movement of exasperation, but controlled himself.</p>

            <p>“Indeed! Directly you heard that I was in Geneva, before even seeing me? It is
                another proof of that confidence which . . . .”</p>

            <p>All at once his tone changed, became more incisive and more detached.</p>

            <p>“Men are poor creatures, Natalia Victorovna. They have no intuition of sentiment. In
                order to speak fittingly to a mother of her lost son one must have had some
                experience of the filial relation. It is not the case with me — if you must know the
                whole truth. Your hopes have to deal here with ‘a breast unwarmed by any affection,’
                as the poet says. . . . That does not mean it is insensible,” he added in a lower
                tone.</p>

            <p>“I am certain your heart is not unfeeling,” said Miss Haldin softly.</p>

            <p>“No. It is not as hard as a stone,” he went on in the same introspective voice, and
                looking as if his heart were lying as heavy as a stone in that unwarmed breast of
                which he spoke. “No, not so hard. But how to prove what you give me credit for — ah!
                that’s another question. No one has ever expected such a thing from me before. No
                one whom my tenderness would have been of any use to. And now you come. You! Now!
                No, Natalia Victorovna. It’s too late. You come too late. You must expect nothing
                from me.”</p>

            <p>She recoiled from him a little, though he had made no movement, as if she had seen
                some change in his face, charging his words with the significance of some hidden
                sentiment they shared together. To me, the silent spectator, they looked like two
                people becoming conscious of a spell which had been lying on them ever since they
                first set eyes on each other. Had either of them cast a glance then in my direction,
                I would have opened the door quietly and gone out. But neither did; and I remained,
                every fear of indiscretion lost in the sense of my enormous remoteness from their
                captivity within the sombre horizon of Russian problems, the boundary of their eyes,
                of their feelings — the prison of their souls.</p>

            <p>Frank, courageous, Miss Haldin controlled her voice in the midst of her trouble.</p>

            <p>“What can this mean?” she asked, as if speaking to herself.</p>

            <p>“It may mean that you have given yourself up to vain imaginings while I have managed
                to remain amongst the truth of things and the realities of life — our Russian life —
                such as they are.”</p>

            <p>“They are cruel,” she murmured.</p>

            <p>“And ugly. Don’t forget that — and ugly. Look where you like. Look near you, here
                abroad where you are, and then look back at home, whence you came.”</p>

            <p>“One must look beyond the present.” Her tone had an ardent conviction.</p>

            <p>“The blind can do that best. I have had the misfortune to be born clear-eyed. And if
                you only knew what strange things I have seen! What amazing and unexpected
                apparitions! . . . But why talk of all this?”</p>

            <p>“On the contrary, I want to talk of all this with you,” she protested with earnest
                serenity. The sombre humours of her brother’s friend left her unaffected, as though
                that bitterness, that suppressed anger, were the signs of an indignant rectitude.
                She saw that he was not an ordinary person, and perhaps she did not want him to be
                other than he appeared to her trustful eyes. “Yes, with you especially,” she
                insisted. “With you of all the Russian people in the world . . . .” A faint smile
                dwelt for a moment on her lips. “I am like poor mother in a way. I too seem unable
                to give up our beloved dead, who, don’t forget, was all in all to us. I don’t want
                to abuse your sympathy, but you must understand that it is in you that we can find
                all that is left of his generous soul.”</p>

            <p>I was looking at him; not a muscle of his face moved in the least. And yet, even at
                the time, I did not suspect him of insensibility. It was a sort of rapt
                thoughtfulness. Then he stirred slightly.</p>

            <p>“You are going, Kirylo Sidorovitch?” she asked.</p>

            <p>“I! Going? Where? Oh yes, but I must tell you first . . . .” His voice was muffled
                and he forced himself to produce it with visible repugnance, as if speech were
                something disgusting or deadly. “That story, you know — the story I heard this
                afternoon . . . .”</p>

            <p>“I know the story already,” she said sadly.</p>

            <p>“You know it! Have you correspondents in St. Petersburg too?”</p>

            <p>“No. It’s Sophia Antonovna. I have seen her just now. She sends you her greetings.
                She is going away to-morrow.”</p>

            <p>He had lowered at last his fascinated glance; she too was looking down, and standing
                thus before each other in the glaring light, between the four bare walls, they
                seemed brought out from the confused immensity of the Eastern borders to be exposed
                cruelly to the observation of my Western eyes. And I observed them. There was
                nothing else to do. My existence seemed so utterly forgotten by these two that I
                dared not now make a movement. And I thought to myself that, of course, they had to
                come together, the sister and the friend of that dead man. The ideas, the hopes, the
                aspirations, the cause of Freedom, expressed in their common affection for Victor
                Haldin, the moral victim of autocracy — all this must draw them to each other
                fatally. Her very ignorance and his loneliness to which he had alluded so strangely
                must work to that end. And, indeed, I saw that the work was done already. Of course.
                It was manifest that they must have been thinking of each other for a long time
                before they met. She had the letter from that beloved brother kindling her
                imagination by the severe praise attached to that one name; and for him to see that
                exceptional girl was enough. The only cause for surprise was his gloomy aloofness
                before her clearly expressed welcome. But he was young, and however austere and
                devoted to his revolutionary ideals, he was not blind. The period of reserve was
                over; he was coming forward in his own way. I could not mistake the significance of
                this late visit, for in what he had to say there was nothing urgent. The true cause
                dawned upon me: he had discovered that he needed her and she was moved by the same
                feeling. It was the second time that I saw them together, and I knew that next time
                they met I would not be there, either remembered or forgotten. I would have
                virtually ceased to exist for both these young people.</p>

            <p>I made this discovery in a very few moments. Meantime, Natalia Haldin was telling
                Razumov briefly of our peregrinations from one end of Geneva to the other. While
                speaking she raised her hands above her head to untie her veil, and that movement
                displayed for an instant the seductive grace of her youthful figure, clad in the
                simplest of mourning. In the transparent shadow the hat rim threw on her face her
                grey eyes had an enticing lustre. Her voice, with its unfeminine yet exquisite
                timbre, was steady, and she spoke quickly, frank, unembarrassed. As she justified
                her action by the mental state of her mother, a spasm of pain marred the generously
                confiding harmony of her features. I perceived that with his downcast eyes he had
                the air of a man who is listening to a strain of music rather than to articulated
                speech. And in the same way, after she had ceased, he seemed to listen yet,
                motionless, as if under the spell of suggestive sound. He came to himself,
                muttering —</p>

            <p>“Yes, yes. She has not shed a tear. She did not seem to hear what I was saying. I
                might have told her anything. She looked as if no longer belonging to this
                world.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin gave signs of profound distress. Her voice faltered. “You don’t know how
                bad it has come to be. She expects now to see <hi>him</hi>!” The veil dropped from
                her fingers and she clasped her hands in anguish. “It shall end by her seeing him,”
                she cried.</p>

            <p>Razumov raised his head sharply and attached on her a prolonged thoughtful
                glance.</p>

            <p>“H’m. That’s very possible,” he muttered in a peculiar tone, as if giving his opinion
                on a matter of fact. “I wonder what . . . .” He checked himself.</p>

            <p>“That would be the end. Her mind shall be gone then, and her spirit will follow.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin unclasped her hands and let them fall by her side.</p>

            <p>“You think so?” he queried profoundly. Miss Haldin’s lips were slightly parted.
                Something unexpected and unfathomable in that young man’s character had fascinated
                her from the first. “No! There’s neither truth nor consolation to be got from the
                phantoms of the dead,” he added after a weighty pause. “I might have told her
                something true; for instance, that your brother meant to save his life — to escape.
                There can be no doubt of that. But I did not.”</p>

            <p>“You did not! But why?”</p>

            <p>“I don’t know. Other thoughts came into my head,” he answered. He seemed to me to be
                watching himself inwardly, as though he were trying to count his own heart-beats,
                while his eyes never for a moment left the face of the girl. “You were not there,”
                he continued. “I had made up my mind never to see you again.”</p>

            <p>This seemed to take her breath away for a moment.</p>

            <p>“You. . . . How is it possible?”</p>

            <p>“You may well ask. . . . However, I think that I refrained from telling your mother
                from prudence. I might have assured her that in the last conversation he held as a
                free man he mentioned you both . . . .”</p>

            <p>“That last conversation was with you,” she struck in her deep, moving voice. “Some
                day you must . . . .”</p>

            <p>“It was with me. Of you he said that you had trustful eyes. And why I have not been
                able to forget that phrase I don’t know. It meant that there is in you no guile, no
                deception, no falsehood, no suspicion — nothing in your heart that could give you a
                conception of a living, acting, speaking lie, if ever it came in your way. That you
                are a predestined victim. . . . Ha! what a devilish suggestion!”</p>

            <p>The convulsive, uncontrolled tone of the last words disclosed the precarious hold he
                had over himself. He was like a man defying his own dizziness in high places and
                tottering suddenly on the very edge of the precipice. Miss Haldin pressed her hand
                to her breast. The dropped black veil lay on the floor between them. Her movement
                steadied him. He looked intently on that hand till it descended slowly, and then
                raised again his eyes to her face. But he did not give her time to speak.</p>

            <p>“No? You don’t understand? Very well.” He had recovered his calm by a miracle of
                will. “So you talked with Sophia Antonovna?”</p>

            <p>“Yes. Sophia Antonovna told me . . . .” Miss Haldin stopped, wonder growing in her
                wide eyes.</p>

            <p>“H’m. That’s the respectable enemy,” he muttered, as though he were alone.</p>

            <p>“The tone of her references to you was extremely friendly,” remarked Miss Haldin,
                after waiting for a while.</p>

            <p>“Is that your impression? And she the most intelligent of the lot, too. Things then
                are going as well as possible. Everything conspires to. . . . Ah! these
                conspirators,” he said slowly, with an accent of scorn; “they would get hold of you
                in no time! You know, Natalia Victorovna, I have the greatest difficulty in saving
                myself from the superstition of an active Providence. It’s irresistible. . . . The
                alternative, of course, would be the personal Devil of our simple ancestors. But, if
                so, he has overdone it altogether — the old Father of Lies — our national patron —
                our domestic god, whom we take with us when we go abroad. He has overdone it. It
                seems that I am not simple enough. . . . That’s it! I ought to have known . . . .
                And I did know it,” he added in a tone of poignant distress which overcame my
                astonishment.</p>

            <p>“This man is deranged,” I said to myself, very much frightened.</p>

            <p>The next moment he gave me a very special impression beyond the range of commonplace
                definitions. It was as though he had stabbed himself outside and had come in there
                to show it; and more than that — as though he were turning the knife in the wound
                and watching the effect. That was the impression, rendered in physical terms. One
                could not defend oneself from a certain amount of pity. But it was for Miss Haldin,
                already so tried in her deepest affections, that I felt a serious concern. Her
                attitude, her face, expressed compassion struggling with doubt on the verge of
                terror.</p>

            <p>“What is it, Kirylo Sidorovitch?” There was a hint of tenderness in that cry. He only
                stared at her in that complete surrender of all his faculties which in a happy lover
                would have had the name of ecstasy.</p>

            <p>“Why are you looking at me like this, Kirylo Sidorovitch? I have approached you
                frankly. I need at this time to see clearly in myself . . . .” She ceased for a
                moment as if to give him an opportunity to utter at last some word worthy of her
                exalted trust in her brother’s friend. His silence became impressive, like a sign of
                a momentous resolution.</p>

            <p>In the end Miss Haldin went on, appealingly —</p>

            <p>“I have waited for you anxiously. But now that you have been moved to come to us in
                your kindness, you alarm me. You speak obscurely. It seems as if you were keeping
                back something from me.”</p>

            <p>“Tell me, Natalia Victorovna,” he was heard at last in a strange unringing voice,
                “whom did you see in that place?”</p>

            <p>She was startled, and as if deceived in her expectations.</p>

            <p>“Where? In Peter Ivanovitch’s rooms? There was Mr. Laspara and three other
                people.”</p>

            <p>“Ha! The vanguard — the forlorn hope of the great plot,” he commented to himself.
                “Bearers of the spark to start an explosion which is meant to change fundamentally
                the lives of so many millions in order that Peter Ivanovitch should be the head of a
                State.”</p>

            <p>“You are teasing me,” she said. “Our dear one told me once to remember that men serve
                always something greater than themselves — the idea.”</p>

            <p>“Our dear one,” he repeated slowly. The effort he made to appear unmoved absorbed all
                the force of his soul. He stood before her like a being with hardly a breath of
                life. His eyes, even as under great physical suffering, had lost all their fire.
                “Ah! your brother. . . . But on your lips, in your voice, it sounds . . . and indeed
                in you everything is divine . . . . I wish I could know the innermost depths of your
                thoughts, of your feelings.”</p>

            <p>“But why, Kirylo Sidorovitch?” she cried, alarmed by these words coming out of
                strangely lifeless lips.</p>

            <p>“Have no fear. It is not to betray you. So you went there? . . . And Sophia
                Antonovna, what did she tell you, then?”</p>

            <p>“She said very little, really. She knew that I should hear everything from you. She
                had no time for more than a few words.” Miss Haldin’s voice dropped and she became
                silent for a moment. “The man, it appears, has taken his life,” she said sadly.</p>

            <p>“Tell me, Natalia Victorovna,” he asked after a pause, “do you believe in
                remorse?”</p>

            <p>“What a question!”</p>

            <p>“What can <hi>you</hi> know of it?” he muttered thickly. “It is not for such as you.
                . . . What I meant to ask was whether you believed in the efficacy of remorse?”</p>

            <p>She hesitated as though she had not understood, then her face lighted up.</p>

            <p>“Yes,” she said firmly.</p>

            <p>“So he is absolved. Moreover, that Ziemianitch was a brute, a drunken brute.”</p>

            <p>A shudder passed through Natalia Haldin.</p>

            <p>“But a man of the people,” Razumov went on, “to whom they, the revolutionists, tell a
                tale of sublime hopes. Well, the people must be forgiven. . . . And you must not
                believe all you’ve heard from that source, either,” he added, with a sort of
                sinister reluctance.</p>

            <p>“You are concealing something from me,” she exclaimed.</p>

            <p>“Do you, Natalia Victorovna, believe in the duty of revenge?”</p>

            <p>“Listen, Kirylo Sidorovitch. I believe that the future shall be merciful to us all.
                Revolutionist and reactionary, victim and executioner, betrayer and betrayed, they
                shall all be pitied together when the light breaks on our black sky at last. Pitied
                and forgotten; for without that there can be no union and no love.”</p>

            <p>“I hear. No revenge for you, then? Never? Not the least bit?” He smiled bitterly with
                his colourless lips. “You yourself are like the very spirit of that merciful future.
                Strange that it does not make it easier. . . . No! But suppose that the real
                betrayer of your brother — Ziemianitch had a part in it too, but insignificant and
                quite involuntary — suppose that he was a young man, educated, an intellectual
                worker, thoughtful, a man your brother might have trusted lightly, perhaps, but
                still — suppose. . . . But there’s a whole story there.”</p>

            <p>“And you know the story! But why, then —”</p>

            <p>“I have heard it. There is a staircase in it, and even phantoms, but that does not
                matter if a man always serves something greater than himself — the idea. I wonder
                who is the greatest victim in that tale?”</p>

            <p>“In that tale!” Miss Haldin repeated. She seemed turned into stone.</p>

            <p>“Do you know why I came to you? It is simply because there is no one anywhere in the
                whole great world I could go to. Do you understand what I say? Not one to go to. Do
                you conceive the desolation of the thought — no one — to — go — to?”</p>

            <p>Utterly misled by her own enthusiastic interpretation of two lines in the letter of a
                visionary, under the spell of her own dread of lonely days, in their overshadowed
                world of angry strife, she was unable to see the truth struggling on his lips. What
                she was conscious of was the obscure form of his suffering. She was on the point of
                extending her hand to him impulsively when he spoke again.</p>

            <p>“An hour after I saw you first I knew how it would be. The terrors of remorse,
                revenge, confession, anger, hate, fear, are like nothing to the atrocious temptation
                which you put in my way the day you appeared before me with your voice, with your
                face, in the garden of that accursed villa.”</p>

            <p>She looked utterly bewildered for a moment; then, with a sort of despairing insight
                went straight to the point.</p>

            <p>“The story, Kirylo Sidorovitch, the story!”</p>

            <p>“There is no more to tell!” He made a movement forward, and she actually put her hand
                on his shoulder to push him away; but her strength failed her, and he kept his
                ground, though trembling in every limb. “It ends here — on this very spot.” He
                pressed a denunciatory finger to his breast with force, and became perfectly
                still.</p>

            <p>I ran forward, snatching up the chair, and was in time to catch hold of Miss Haldin
                and lower her down. As she sank into it she swung half round on my arm, and remained
                averted from us both, drooping over the back. He looked at her with an appalling
                expressionless tranquillity. Incredulity, struggling with astonishment, anger, and
                disgust, deprived me for a time of the power of speech. Then I turned on him,
                whispering from very rage —</p>

            <p>“This is monstrous. What are you staying for? Don’t let her catch sight of you again.
                Go away! . . .” He did not budge. “Don’t you understand that your presence is
                intolerable — even to me? If there’s any sense of shame in you . . . .”</p>

            <p>Slowly his sullen eyes moved ill my direction. “How did this old man come here?” he
                muttered, astounded.</p>

            <p>Suddenly Miss Haldin sprang up from the chair, made a few steps, and tottered.
                Forgetting my indignation, and even the man himself, I hurried to her assistance. I
                took her by the arm, and she let me lead her into the drawing-room. Away from the
                lamp, in the deeper dusk of the distant end, the profile of Mrs. Haldin, her hands,
                her whole figure had the stillness of a sombre painting. Miss Haldin stopped, and
                pointed mournfully at the tragic immobility of her mother, who seemed to watch a
                beloved head lying in her lap.</p>

            <p>That gesture had an unequalled force of expression, so far-reaching in its human
                distress that one could not believe that it pointed out merely the ruthless working
                of political institutions. After assisting Miss Haldin to the sofa, I turned round
                to go back and shut the door Framed in the opening, in the searching glare of the
                white anteroom, my eyes fell on Razumov, still there, standing before the empty
                chair, as if rooted for ever to the spot of his atrocious confession. A wonder came
                over me that the mysterious force which had torn it out of him had failed to destroy
                his life, to shatter his body. It was there unscathed. I stared at the broad line of
                his shoulders, his dark head, the amazing immobility of his limbs. At his feet the
                veil dropped by Miss Haldin looked intensely black in the white crudity of the
                light. He was gazing at it spell-bound. Next moment, stooping with an incredible,
                savage swiftness, he snatched it up and pressed it to his face with both hands.
                Something, extreme astonishment perhaps, dimmed my eyes, so that he seemed to vanish
                before he moved.</p>

            <p>The slamming of the outer door restored my sight, and I went on contemplating the
                empty chair in the empty ante-room. The meaning of what I had seen reached my mind
                with a staggering shock. I seized Natalia Haldin by the shoulder.</p>

            <p>“That miserable wretch has carried off your veil!” I cried, in the scared, deadened
                voice of an awful discovery. “He . . . .”</p>

            <p>The rest remained unspoken. I stepped back and looked down at her, in silent horror.
                Her hands were lying lifelessly, palms upwards, on her lap. She raised her grey eyes
                slowly. Shadows seemed to come and go in them as if the steady flame of her soul had
                been made to vacillate at last in the cross-currents of poisoned air from the
                corrupted dark immensity claiming her for its own, where virtues themselves fester
                into crimes in the cynicism of oppression and revolt.</p>

            <p>“It is impossible to be more unhappy . . . .” The languid whisper of her voice struck
                me with dismay. “It is impossible. . . . I feel my heart becoming like ice.”</p>

        <div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="chapter">

            <head>4</head>


            <p>Razumov walked straight home on the wet glistening pavement. A heavy shower passed
                over him; distant lightning played faintly against the fronts of the dumb houses
                with the shuttered shops all along the Rue de Carouge; and now and then, after the
                faint flash, there was a faint, sleepy rumble; but the main forces of the
                thunderstorm remained massed down the Rhone valley as if loath to attack the
                respectable and passionless abode of democratic liberty, the serious-minded town of
                dreary hotels, tendering the same indifferent, hospitality to tourists of all
                nations and to international conspirators of every shade.</p>

            <p>The owner of the shop was making ready to close when Razumov entered and without a
                word extended his hand for the key of his room. On reaching it for him, from a
                shelf, the man was about to pass a small joke as to taking the air in a
                thunderstorm, but, after looking at the face of his lodger, he only observed, just
                to say something —</p>

            <p>“You’ve got very wet.”</p>

            <p>“Yes, I am washed clean,” muttered Razumov, who was dripping from head to foot, and
                passed through the inner door towards the staircase leading to his room.</p>

            <p>He did not change his clothes, but, after lighting the candle, took off his watch and
                chain, laid them on the table, and sat down at once to write. The book of his
                compromising record was kept in a locked drawer, which he pulled out violently, and
                did not even trouble to push back afterwards.</p>

            <p>In this queer pedantism of a man who had read, thought, lived, pen in hand, there is
                the sincerity of the attempt to grapple by the same means with another profounder
                knowledge. After some passages which have been already made use of in the building
                up of this narrative, or add nothing new to the psychological side of this
                disclosure (there is even one more allusion to the silver medal in this last entry),
                comes a page and a half of incoherent writing where his expression is baffled by the
                novelty and the mysteriousness of that side of our emotional life to which his
                solitary existence had been a stranger. Then only he begins to address directly the
                reader he had in his mind, trying to express in broken sentences, full of wonder and
                awe, the sovereign (he uses that very word) power of her person over his
                imagination, in which lay the dormant seed of her brother’s words.</p>

            <p>“ . . . The most trustful eyes in the world — your brother said of you when he was as
                well as a dead man already. And when you stood before me with your hand extended, I
                remembered the very sound of his voice, and I looked into your eyes — and that was
                enough. I knew that something had happened, but I did not know then what. . . . But
                don’t be deceived, Natalia Victorovna. I believed that I had in my breast nothing
                but an inexhaustible fund of anger and hate for you both. I remembered that he had
                looked to you for the perpetuation of his visionary soul. He, this man who had
                robbed me of my hard-working, purposeful existence. I, too, had my guiding idea; and
                remember that, amongst us, it is more difficult to lead a life of toil and
                self-denial than to go out in the street and kill from conviction. But enough of
                that. Hate or no hate, I felt at once that, while shunning the sight of you, I could
                never succeed in driving away your image. I would say, addressing that dead man, ‘Is
                this the way you are going to haunt me?’ It is only later on that I understood —
                only to-day, only a few hours ago. What could I have known of what was tearing me to
                pieces and dragging the secret for ever to my lips? You were appointed to undo the
                evil by making me betray myself back into truth and peace. You! And you have done it
                in the same way, too, in which he ruined me: by forcing upon me your confidence.
                Only what I detested him for, in you ended by appearing noble and exalted. But, I
                repeat, be not deceived. I was given up to evil. I exulted in having induced that
                silly innocent fool to steal his father’s money. He was a fool, but not a thief. I
                made him one. It was necessary. I had to confirm myself in my contempt and hate for
                what I betrayed. I have suffered from as many vipers in my heart as any social
                democrat of them all — vanity, ambitions, jealousies, shameful desires, evil
                passions of envy and revenge. I had my security stolen from me, years of good work,
                my best hopes. Listen — now comes the true confession. The other was nothing. To
                save me, your trustful eyes had to entice my thought to the very edge of the
                blackest treachery. I could see them constantly looking at me with the confidence of
                your pure heart which had not been touched by evil things. Victor Haldin had stolen
                the truth of my life from me, who had nothing else in the world, and he boasted of
                living on through you on this earth where I had no place to lay my head on. She will
                marry some day, he had said — and your eyes were trustful. And do you know what I
                said to myself? I shall steal his sister’s soul from her. When we met that first
                morning in the gardens, and you spoke to me confidingly in the generosity of your
                spirit, I was thinking, ‘Yes, he himself by talking of her trustful eyes has
                delivered her into my hands!’ If you could have looked then into my heart, you would
                have cried out aloud with terror and disgust.</p>

            <p>“Perhaps no one will believe the baseness of such an intention to be possible. It’s
                certain that, when we parted that morning, I gloated over it. I brooded upon the
                best way. The old man you introduced me to insisted on walking with me. I don’t know
                who he is. He talked of you, of your lonely, helpless state, and every word of that
                friend of yours was egging me on to the unpardonable sin of stealing a soul. Could
                he have been the devil himself in the shape of an old Englishman? Natalia
                Victorovna, I was possessed! I returned to look at you every day, and drink in your
                presence the poison of my infamous intention. But I foresaw difficulties. Then
                Sophia Antonovna, of whom I was not thinking — I had forgotten her existence —
                appears suddenly with that tale from St. Petersburg. . . . The only thing needed to
                make me safe — a trusted revolutionist for ever.</p>

            <p>“It was as if Ziemianitch had hanged himself to help me on to further crime. The
                strength of falsehood seemed irresistible. These people stood doomed by the folly
                and the illusion that was in them — they being themselves the slaves of lies.
                Natalia Victorovna, I embraced the might of falsehood, I exulted in it — I gave
                myself up to it for a time. Who could have resisted! You yourself were the prize of
                it. I sat alone in my room, planning a life, the very thought of which makes me
                shudder now, like a believer who had been tempted to an atrocious sacrilege. But I
                brooded ardently over its images. The only thing was that there seemed to be no air
                in it. And also I was afraid of your mother. I never knew mine. I’ve never known any
                kind of love. There is something in the mere word. . . . Of you, I was not afraid —
                forgive me for telling you this. No, not of you. You were truth itself. You could
                not suspect me. As to your mother, you yourself feared already that her mind had
                given way from grief. Who could believe anything against me? Had not Ziemianitch
                hanged himself from remorse? I said to myself, ‘Let’s put it to the test, and be
                done with it once for all.’ I trembled when I went in; but your mother hardly
                listened to what I was saying to her, and, in a little while, seemed to have
                forgotten my very existence. I sat looking at her. There was no longer anything
                between you and me. You were defenceless — and soon, very soon, you would be alone.
                . . . I thought of you. Defenceless. For days you have talked with me — opening your
                heart. I remembered the shadow of your eyelashes over your grey trustful eyes. And
                your pure forehead! It is low like the forehead of statues — calm, unstained. It was
                as if your pure brow bore a light which fell on me, searched my heart and saved me
                from ignominy, from ultimate undoing. And it saved you too. Pardon my presumption.
                But there was that in your glances which seemed to tell me that you. . . . Your
                light! your truth! I felt that I must tell you that I had ended by loving you. And
                to tell you that I must first confess. Confess, go out — and perish.</p>

            <p>“Suddenly you stood before me! You alone in all the world to whom I must confess. You
                fascinated me — you have freed me from the blindness of anger and hate — the truth
                shining in you drew the truth out of me. Now I have done it; and as I write here, I
                am in the depths depths of anguish, but there is air to breathe at last — air! And,
                by the by, that old man sprang up from somewhere as I was speaking to you, and raged
                at me like a disappointed devil. I suffer horribly, but I am not in despair. There
                is only one more thing to do for me. After that — if they let me — I shall go away
                and bury myself in obscure misery. In giving Victor Haldin up, it was myself, after
                all, whom I have betrayed most basely. You must believe what I say now, you can’t
                refuse to believe this. Most basely. It is through you that I came to feel this so
                deeply. After all, it is they and not I who have the right on their side? — theirs
                is the strength of invisible powers. So be it. Only don’t be deceived, Natalia
                Victorovna, I am not converted. Have I then the soul of a slave? No! I am
                independent — and therefore perdition is my lot.”</p>

            <p>On these words, he stopped writing, shut the book, and wrapped it in the black veil
                he had carried off. He then ransacked the drawers for paper and string, made up a
                parcel which he addressed to Miss Haldin, Boulevard des Philosophes, and then flung
                the pen away from him into a distant corner.</p>

            <p>This done, he sat down with the watch before him. He could have gone out at once, but
                the hour had not struck yet. The hour would be midnight. There was no reason for
                that choice except that the facts and the words of a certain evening in his past
                were timing his conduct in the present. The sudden power Natalia Haldin had gained
                over him he ascribed to the same cause. “You don’t walk with impunity over a
                phantom’s breast,” he heard himself mutter. “Thus he saves me,” he thought suddenly.
                “He himself, the betrayed man.” The vivid image of Miss Haldin seemed to stand by
                him, watching him relentlessly. She was not disturbing. He had done with life, and
                his thought even in her presence tried to take an impartial survey. Now his scorn
                extended to himself. “I had neither the simplicity nor the courage nor the
                self-possession to be a scoundrel, or an exceptionally able man. For who, with us in
                Russia, is to tell a scoundrel from an exceptionally able man? . . .”</p>

            <p>He was the puppet of his past, because at the very stroke of midnight he jumped up
                and ran swiftly downstairs as if confident that, by the power of destiny, the house
                door would fly open before the absolute necessity of his errand. And as a matter of
                fact, just as he got to the bottom of the stairs, it was opened for him by some
                people of the house coming home late — two men and a woman. He slipped out through
                them into the street, swept then by a fitful gust of wind. They were, of course,
                very much startled. A flash of lightning enabled them to observe him walking away
                quickly. One of the men shouted, and was starting in pursuit, but the woman had
                recognized him. “It’s all right. It’s only that young Russian from the third floor.”
                The darkness returned with a single clap of thunder, like a gun fired for a warning
                of his escape from the prison of lies.</p>

            <p>He must have heard at some time or other and now remembered unconsciously that there
                was to be a gathering of revolutionists at the house of Julius Laspara that evening.
                At any rate, he made straight for the Laspara house, and found himself without
                surprise ringing at its street door, which, of course, was closed. By that time the
                thunderstorm had attacked in earnest. The steep incline of the street ran with
                water, the thick fall of rain enveloped him like a luminous veil in the play of
                lightning. He was perfectly calm, and, between the crashes, listened attentively to
                the delicate tinkling of the doorbell somewhere within the house.</p>

            <p>There was some difficulty before he was admitted. His person was not known to that
                one of the guests who had volunteered to go downstairs and see what was the matter.
                Razumov argued with him patiently. There could be no harm in admitting a caller. He
                had something to communicate to the company upstairs.</p>

            <p>“Something of importance?”</p>

            <p>“That’ll be for the hearers to judge.”</p>

            <p>“Urgent?”</p>

            <p>“Without a moment’s delay.”</p>

            <p>Meantime, one of the Laspara daughters descended the stairs, small lamp in hand, in a
                grimy and crumpled gown, which seemed to hang on her by a miracle, and looking more
                than ever like an old doll with a dusty brown wig, dragged from under a sofa. She
                recognized Razumov at once.</p>

            <p>“How do you do? Of course you may come in.”</p>

            <p>Following her light, Razumov climbed two flights of stairs from the lower darkness.
                Leaving the lamp on a bracket on the landing, she opened a door, and went in,
                accompanied by the sceptical guest. Razumov entered last. He closed the door behind
                him, and stepping on one side, put his back against the wall.</p>

            <p>The three little rooms <hi>en suite</hi>, with low, smoky ceilings and lit by
                paraffin lamps, were crammed with people. Loud talking was going on in all three,
                and tea-glasses, full, half-full, and empty, stood everywhere, even on the floor.
                The other Laspara girl sat, dishevelled and languid, behind an enormous samovar. In
                the inner doorway Razumov had a glimpse of the protuberance of a large stomach,
                which he recognized. Only a few feet from him Julius Laspara was getting down
                hurriedly from his high stool.</p>

            <p>The appearance of the midnight visitor caused no small sensation. Laspara is very
                summary in his version of that night’s happenings. After some words of greeting,
                disregarded by Razumov, Laspara (ignoring purposely his guest’s soaked condition and
                his extraordinary manner of presenting himself) mentioned something about writing an
                article. He was growing uneasy, and Razumov appeared absent-minded. “I have written
                already all I shall ever write,” he said at last, with a little laugh.</p>

            <p>The whole company’s attention was riveted on the new-comer, dripping with water,
                deadly pale, and keeping his position against the wall. Razumov put Laspara gently
                aside, as though he wished to be seen from head to foot by everybody. By then the
                buzz of conversations had died down completely, even in the most distant of the
                three rooms. The doorway facing Razumov became blocked by men and women, who craned
                their necks and certainly seemed to expect something startling to happen.</p>

            <p>A squeaky, insolent declaration was heard from that group.</p>

            <p>“I know this ridiculously conceited individual.”</p>

            <p>“What individual?” asked Razumov, raising his bowed head, and searching with his eyes
                all the eyes fixed upon him. An intense surprised silence lasted for a time. “If
                it’s me . . . .”</p>

            <p>He stopped, thinking over the form of his confession, and found it suddenly,
                unavoidably suggested by the fateful evening of his life.</p>

            <p>“I am come here,” he began, in a clear voice, “to talk of an individual called
                Ziemianitch. Sophia Antonovna has informed me that she would make public a certain
                letter from St. Petersburg . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Sophia Antonovna has left us early in the evening,” said Laspara. “It’s quite
                correct. Everybody here has heard . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Very well,” Razumov interrupted, with a shade of impatience, for his heart was
                beating strongly. Then, mastering his voice so far that there was even a touch of
                irony in his clear, forcible enunciation —</p>

            <p>“In justice to that individual, the much ill-used peasant, Ziemianitch, I now declare
                solemnly that the conclusions of that letter calumniate a man of the people — a
                bright Russian soul. Ziemianitch had nothing to do with the actual arrest of Victor
                Haldin.”</p>

            <p>Razumov dwelt on the name heavily, and then waited till the faint, mournful murmur
                which greeted it had died out.</p>

            <p>“Victor Victorovitch Haldin,” he began again, “acting with, no doubt, noble-minded
                imprudence, took refuge with a certain student of whose opinions he knew nothing but
                what his own illusions suggested to his generous heart. It was an unwise display of
                confidence. But I am not here to appreciate the actions of Victor Haldin. Am I to
                tell you of the feelings of that student, sought out in his obscure solitude, and
                menaced by the complicity forced upon him? Am I to tell you what he did? It’s a
                rather complicated story. In the end the student went to General T—— himself, and
                said, ‘I have the man who killed de P—— locked up in my room, Victor Haldin — a
                student like myself.’”</p>

            <p>A great buzz arose, in which Razumov raised his voice.</p>

            <p>“Observe — that man had certain honest ideals in view. But I didn’t come here to
                explain him.”</p>

            <p>“No. But you must explain how you know all this,” came in grave tones from
                somebody.</p>

            <p>“A vile coward!” This simple cry vibrated with indignation. “Name him!” shouted other
                voices.</p>

            <p>“What are you clamouring for?” said Razumov disdainfully, in the profound silence
                which fell on the raising of his hand. “Haven’t you all understood that I am that
                man?”</p>

            <p>Laspara went away brusquely from his side and climbed upon his stool. In the first
                forward surge of people towards him, Razumov expected to be torn to pieces, but they
                fell back without touching him, and nothing came of it but noise. It was
                bewildering. His head ached terribly. In the confused uproar he made out several
                times the name of Peter Ivanovitch, the word “judgement,” and the phrase, “But this
                is a confession,” uttered by somebody in a desperate shriek. In the midst of the
                tumult, a young man, younger than himself, approached him with blazing eyes.</p>

            <p>“I must beg you,” he said, with venomous politeness, “to be good enough not to move
                from this spot till you are told what you are to do.”</p>

            <p>Razumov shrugged his shoulders. “I came in voluntarily.”</p>

            <p>“Maybe. But you won’t go out till you are permitted,” retorted the other.</p>

            <p>He beckoned with his hand, calling out, “Louisa! Louisa! come here, please”; and,
                presently, one of the Laspara girls (they had been staring at Razumov from behind
                the samovar) came along, trailing a bedraggled tail of dirty flounces, and dragging
                with her a chair, which she set against the door, and, sitting down on it, crossed
                her legs. The young man thanked her effusively, and rejoined a group carrying on an
                animated discussion in low tones. Razumov lost himself for a moment.</p>

            <p>A squeaky voice screamed, “Confession or no confession, you are a police spy!”</p>

            <p>The revolutionist Nikita had pushed his way in front of Razumov, and faced him with
                his big, livid cheeks, his heavy paunch, bull neck, and enormous hands. Razumov
                looked at the famous slayer of gendarmes in silent disgust.</p>

            <p>“And what are you?” he said, very low, then shut his eyes, and rested the back of his
                head against the wall.</p>

            <p>“It would be better for you to depart now.” Razumov heard a mild, sad voice, and
                opened his eyes. The gentle speaker was an elderly man, with a great brush of fine
                hair making a silvery halo all round his keen, intelligent face. “Peter Ivanovitch
                shall be informed of your confession — and you shall be directed . . . .”</p>

            <p>Then, turning to Nikita, nicknamed Necator, standing by, he appealed to him in a
                murmur —</p>

            <p>“What else can we do? After this piece of sincerity he cannot be dangerous any
                longer.”</p>

            <p>The other muttered, “Better make sure of that before we let him go. Leave that to me.
                I know how to deal with such gentlemen.”</p>

            <p>He exchanged meaning glances with two or three men, who nodded slightly, then turning
                roughly to Razumov, “You have heard? You are not wanted here. Why don’t you get
                out?”</p>

            <p>The Laspara girl on guard rose, and pulled the chair out of the way unemotionally.
                She gave a sleepy stare to Razumov, who started, looked round the room and passed
                slowly by her as if struck by some sudden thought.</p>

            <p>“I beg you to observe,” he said, already on the landing, “that I had only to hold my
                tongue. To-day, of all days since I came amongst you, I was made safe, and to-day I
                made myself free from falsehood, from remorse — independent of every single human
                being on this earth.”</p>

            <p>He turned his back on the room, and walked towards the stairs, but, at the violent
                crash of the door behind him, he looked over his shoulder and saw that Nikita, with
                three others, had followed him out. “They are going to kill me, after all,” he
                thought.</p>

            <p>Before he had time to turn round and confront them fairly, they set on him with a
                rush. He was driven headlong against the wall. “I wonder how,” he completed his
                thought. Nikita cried, with a shrill laugh right in his face, “We shall make you
                harmless. You wait a bit.”</p>

            <p>Razumov did not struggle. The three men held him pinned against the wall, while
                Nikita, taking up a position a little on one side, deliberately swung off his
                enormous arm. Razumov, looking for a knife in his hand, saw it come at him open,
                unarmed, and received a tremendous blow on the side of his head over his ear. At the
                same time he heard a faint, dull detonating sound, as if some one had fired a pistol
                on the other side of the wall. A raging fury awoke in him at this outrage. The
                people in Laspara’s rooms, holding their breath, listened to the desperate scuffling
                of four men all over the landing; thuds against the walls, a terrible crash against
                the very door, then all of them went down together with a violence which seemed to
                shake the whole house. Razumov, overpowered, breathless, crushed under the weight of
                his assailants, saw the monstrous Nikita squatting on his heels near his head, while
                the others held him down, kneeling on his chest, gripping his throat, lying across
                his legs.</p>

            <p>“Turn his face the other way,” the paunchy terrorist directed, in an excited, gleeful
                squeak.</p>

            <p>Razumov could struggle no longer. He was exhausted; he had to watch passively the
                heavy open hand of the brute descend again in a degrading blow over his other ear.
                It seemed to split his head in two, and all at once the men holding him became
                perfectly silent — soundless as shadows. In silence they pulled him brutally to his
                feet, rushed with him noiselessly down the staircase, and, opening the door, flung
                him out into the street.</p>

            <p>He fell forward, and at once rolled over and over helplessly, going down the short
                slope together with the rush of running rain water. He came to rest in the roadway
                of the street at the bottom, lying on his back, with a great flash of lightning over
                his face — a vivid, silent flash of lightning which blinded him utterly. He picked
                himself up, and put his arm over his eyes to recover his sight. Not a sound reached
                him from anywhere, and he began to walk, staggering, down a long, empty street. The
                lightning waved and darted round him its silent flames, the water of the deluge
                fell, ran, leaped, drove — noiseless like the drift of mist. In this unearthly
                stillness his footsteps fell silent on the pavement, while a dumb wind drove him on
                and on, like a lost mortal in a phantom world ravaged by a soundless thunderstorm.
                God only knows where his noiseless feet took him to that night, here and there, and
                back again without pause or rest. Of one place, at least, where they did lead him,
                we heard afterwards; and, in the morning, the driver of the first south-shore
                tramcar, clanging his bell desperately, saw a bedraggled, soaked man without a hat,
                and walking in the roadway unsteadily with his head down, step right in front of his
                car, and go under.</p>

            <p>When they picked him up, with two broken limbs and a crushed side, Razumov had not
                lost consciousness. It was as though he had tumbled, smashing himself, into a world
                of mutes. Silent men, moving unheard, lifted him up, laid him on the sidewalk,
                gesticulating and grimacing round him their alarm, horror, and compassion. A red
                face with moustaches stooped close over him, lips moving, eyes rolling. Razumov
                tried hard to understand the reason of this dumb show. To those who stood around
                him, the features of that stranger, so grievously hurt, seemed composed in
                meditation. Afterwards his eyes sent out at them a look of fear and closed slowly.
                They stared at him. Razumov made an effort to remember some French words.</p>

            <p>“<hi>Je suis sourd</hi>,” he had time to utter feebly, before he fainted.</p>

            <p>“He is deaf,” they exclaimed to each other. “That’s why he did not hear the car.”</p>

            <p>They carried him off in that same car. Before it started on its journey, a woman in a
                shabby black dress, who had run out of the iron gate of some private grounds up the
                road, clambered on to the rear platform and would not be put off.</p>

            <p>“I am a relation,” she insisted, in bad French. “This young man is a Russian, and I
                am his relation.” On this plea they let her have her way. She sat down calmly, and
                took his head on her lap; her scared faded eyes avoided looking at his deathlike
                face. At the corner of a street, on the other side of the town, a stretcher met the
                car. She followed it to the door of the hospital, where they let her come in and see
                him laid on a bed. Razumov’s new-found relation never shed a tear, but the officials
                had some difficulty in inducing her to go away. The porter observed her lingering on
                the opposite pavement for a long time. Suddenly, as though she had remembered
                something, she ran off.</p>

            <p>The ardent hater of all Finance ministers, the slave of Madame de S— — had made up
                her mind to offer her resignation as lady companion to the Egeria of Peter
                Ivanovitch. She had found work to do after her own heart.</p>

            <p>But hours before, while the thunderstorm still raged in the night, there had been in
                the rooms of Julius Laspara a great sensation. The terrible Nikita, coming in from
                the landing, uplifted his squeaky voice in horrible glee before all the
                company —</p>

            <p>“Razumov! Mr. Razumov! The wonderful Razumov! He shall never be any use as a spy on
                any one. He won’t talk, because he will never hear anything in his life — not a
                thing! I have burst the drums of his ears for him. Oh, you may trust me. I know the
                trick. Ha! Ha! Ha! I know the trick.”</p>

            <head>5</head>


            <p>It was nearly a fortnight after her mother’s funeral that I saw Natalia Haldin for
                the last time.</p>

            <p>In those silent, sombre days the doors of the <hi>appartement</hi> on the Boulevard
                des Philosophes were closed to every one but myself. I believe I was of some use, if
                only in this, that I alone was aware of the incredible part of the situation. Miss
                Haldin nursed her mother alone to the last moment. If Razumov’s visit had anything
                to do with Mrs. Haldin’s end (and I cannot help thinking that it hastened it
                considerably), it is because the man, trusted impulsively by the ill-fated Victor
                Haldin, had failed to gain the confidence of Victor Haldin’s mother. What tale,
                precisely, he told her cannot be known — at any rate, I do not know it — but to me
                she seemed to die from the shock of an ultimate disappointment borne in silence. She
                had not believed him. Perhaps she could not longer believe any one, and consequently
                had nothing to say to any one — not even to her daughter. I suspect that Miss Haldin
                lived the heaviest hours of her life by that silent death-bed. I confess I was angry
                with the broken-hearted old woman passing away in the obstinacy of her mute distrust
                of her daughter.</p>

            <p>When it was all over I stood aside. Miss Haldin had her compatriots round her then. A
                great number of them attended the funeral. I was there too, but afterwards managed
                to keep away from Miss Haldin, till I received a short note rewarding my
                self-denial. “It is as you would have it. I am going back to Russia at once. My mind
                is made up. Come and see me.”</p>

            <p>Verily, it was a reward of discretion. I went without delay to receive it. The
                    <hi>appartement</hi> of the Boulevard des Philosophes presented the dreary signs
                of impending abandonment. It looked desolate and as if already empty to my eyes.</p>

            <p>Standing, we exchanged a few words about her health, mine, remarks as to some people
                of the Russian colony, and then Natalia Haldin, establishing me on the sofa, began
                to talk openly of her future work, of her plans. It was all to be as I had wished
                it. And it was to be for life. We should never see each other again. Never!</p>

            <p>I gathered this success to my breast. Natalia Haldin looked matured by her open and
                secret experiences. With her arms folded she walked up and down the whole length of
                the room, talking slowly, smooth-browed, with a resolute profile. She gave me a new
                view of herself, and I marvelled at that something grave and measured in her voice,
                in her movements, in her manner. It was the perfection of collected independence.
                The strength of her nature had come to surface because the obscure depths had been
                stirred.</p>

            <p>“We two can talk of it now,” she observed, after a silence and stopping short before
                me. “Have you been to inquire at the hospital lately?”</p>

            <p>“Yes, I have.” And as she looked at me fixedly, “He will live, the doctors say. But I
                thought that Tekla . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Tekla has not been near me for several days,” explained Miss Haldin quickly. “As I
                never offered to go to the hospital with her, she thinks that I have no heart. She
                is disillusioned about me.”</p>

            <p>And Miss Haldin smiled faintly.</p>

            <p>“Yes. She sits with him as long and as often as they will let her,” I said. “She says
                she must never abandon him — never as long as she lives. He’ll need somebody — a
                hopeless cripple, and stone deaf with that.”</p>

            <p>“Stone deaf? I didn’t know,” murmured Natalia Haldin.</p>

            <p>“He is. It seems strange. I am told there were no apparent injuries to the head. They
                say, too, that it is not very likely that he will live so very long for Tekla to
                take care of him.”</p>

            <p>Miss Haldin shook her head.</p>

            <p>“While there are travellers ready to fall by the way our Tekla shall never be idle.
                She is a good Samaritan by an irresistible vocation. The revolutionists didn’t
                understand her. Fancy a devoted creature like that being employed to carry about
                documents sewn in her dress, or made to write from dictation.”</p>

            <p>“There is not much perspicacity in the world.”</p>

            <p>No sooner uttered, I regretted that observation. Natalia Haldin, looking me straight
                in the face, assented by a slight movement of her head. She was not offended, but
                turning away began to pace the room again. To my western eyes she seemed to be
                getting farther and farther from me, quite beyond my reach now, but undiminished in
                the increasing distance. I remained silent as though it were hopeless to raise my
                voice. The sound of hers, so close to me, made me start a little.</p>

            <p>“Tekla saw him picked up after the accident. The good soul never explained to me
                really how it came about. She affirms that there was some understanding between them
                — some sort of compact — that in any sore need, in misfortune, or difficulty, or
                pain, he was to come to her.”</p>

            <p>“Was there?” I said. “It is lucky for him that there was, then. He’ll need all the
                devotion of the good Samaritan.”</p>

            <p>It was a fact that Tekla, looking out of her window at five in the morning, for some
                reason or other, had beheld Razumov in the grounds of the Chateau Borel, standing
                stockstill, bare-headed in the rain, at the foot of the terrace. She had screamed
                out to him, by name, to know what was the matter. He never even raised his head. By
                the time she had dressed herself sufficiently to run downstairs he was gone. She
                started in pursuit, and rushing out into the road, came almost directly upon the
                arrested tramcar and the small knot of people picking up Razumov. That much Tekla
                had told me herself one afternoon we happened to meet at the door of the hospital,
                and without any kind of comment. But I did not want to meditate very long on the
                inwardness of this peculiar episode.</p>

            <p>“Yes, Natalia Victorovna, he shall need somebody when they dismiss him, on crutches
                and stone deaf from the hospital. But I do not think that when he rushed like an
                escaped madman into the grounds of the Chateau Borel it was to seek the help of that
                good Tekla.”</p>

            <p>“No,” said Natalia, stopping short before me, “perhaps not.” She sat down and leaned
                her head on her hand thoughtfully. The silence lasted for several minutes. During
                that time I remembered the evening of his atrocious confession — the plaint she
                seemed to have hardly enough life left in her to utter, “It is impossible to be more
                unhappy . . . .” The recollection would have given me a shudder if I had not been
                lost in wonder at her force and her tranquillity. There was no longer any Natalia
                Haldin, because she had completely ceased to think of herself. It was a great
                victory, a characteristically Russian exploit in self-suppression.</p>

            <p>She recalled me to myself by getting up suddenly like a person who has come to a
                decision. She walked to the writing-table, now stripped of all the small objects
                associated with her by daily use — a mere piece of dead furniture; but it contained
                something living, still, since she took from a recess a flat parcel which she
                brought to me.</p>

            <p>“It’s a book,” she said rather abruptly. “It was sent to me wrapped up in my veil. I
                told you nothing at the time, but now I’ve decided to leave it with you. I have the
                right to do that. It was sent to me. It is mine. You may preserve it, or destroy it
                after you have read it. And while you read it, please remember that I was
                defenceless. And that he . . . .”</p>

            <p>“Defenceless!” I repeated, surprised, looking hard at her.</p>

            <p>“You’ll find the very word written there,” she whispered. “Well, it’s true! I
                    <hi>was</hi> defenceless — but perhaps you were able to see that for yourself.”
                Her face coloured, then went deadly pale. “In justice to the man, I want you to
                remember that I was. Oh, I was, I was!”</p>

            <p>I rose, a little shakily.</p>

            <p>“I am not likely to forget anything you say at this our last parting.”</p>

            <p>Her hand fell into mine.</p>

            <p>“It’s difficult to believe that it must be good-bye with us.”</p>

            <p>She returned my pressure and our hands separated.</p>

            <p>“Yes. I am leaving here to-morrow. My eyes are open at last and my hands are free
                now. As for the rest — which of us can fail to hear the stifled cry of our great
                distress? It may be nothing to the world.”</p>

            <p>“The world is more conscious of your discordant voices,” I said. “It is the way of
                the world.”</p>

            <p>“Yes.” She bowed her head in assent, and hesitated for a moment. “I must own to you
                that I shall never give up looking forward to the day when all discord shall be
                silenced. Try to imagine its dawn! The tempest of blows and of execrations is over;
                all is still; the new sun is rising, and the weary men united at last, taking count
                in their conscience of the ended contest, feel saddened by their victory, because so
                many ideas have perished for the triumph of one, so many beliefs have abandoned them
                without support. They feel alone on the earth and gather close together. Yes, there
                must be many bitter hours! But at last the anguish of hearts shall be extinguished
                in love.”</p>

            <p>And on this last word of her wisdom, a word so sweet, so bitter, so cruel sometimes,
                I said good-bye to Natalia Haldin. It is hard to think I shall never look any more
                into the trustful eyes of that girl — wedded to an invincible belief in the advent
                of loving concord springing like a heavenly flower from the soil of men’s earth,
                soaked in blood, torn by struggles, watered with tears.</p>

            <p>It must be understood that at that time I didn’t know anything of Mr. Razumov’s
                confession to the assembled revolutionists. Natalia Haldin might have guessed what
                was the “one thing more” which remained for him to do; but this my western eyes had
                failed to see.</p>

            <p>Tekla, the ex-lady companion of Madame de S— — haunted his bedside at the hospital.
                We met once or twice at the door of that establishment, but on these occasions she
                was not communicative. She gave me news of Mr. Razumov as concisely as possible. He
                was making a slow recovery, but would remain a hopeless cripple all his life.
                Personally, I never went near him: I never saw him again, after the awful evening
                when I stood by, a watchful but ignored spectator of his scene with Miss Haldin. He
                was in due course discharged from the hospital, and his “relative”— so I was told —
                had carried him off somewhere.</p>

            <p>My information was completed nearly two years later. The opportunity, certainly, was
                not of my seeking; it was quite accidentally that I met a much-trusted woman
                revolutionist at the house of a distinguished Russian gentleman of liberal
                convictions, who came to live in Geneva for a time.</p>

            <p>He was a quite different sort of celebrity from Peter Ivanovitch — a dark-haired man
                with kind eyes, high-shouldered, courteous, and with something hushed and
                circumspect in his manner. He approached me, choosing the moment when there was no
                one near, followed by a grey-haired, alert lady in a crimson blouse.</p>

            <p>“Our Sophia Antonovna wishes to be made known to you,” he addressed me, in his
                guarded voice. “And so I leave you two to have a talk together.”</p>

            <p>“I would never have intruded myself upon your notice,” the grey-haired lady began at
                once, “if I had not been charged with a message for you.”</p>

            <p>It was a message of a few friendly words from Natalia Haldin. Sophia Antonovna had
                just returned from a secret excursion into Russia, and had seen Miss Haldin. She
                lived in a town “in the centre,” sharing her compassionate labours between the
                horrors of overcrowded jails, and the heartrending misery of bereaved homes. She did
                not spare herself in good service, Sophia Antonovna assured me.</p>

            <p>“She has a faithful soul, an undaunted spirit and an indefatigable body,” the woman
                revolutionist summed it all up, with a touch of enthusiasm.</p>

            <p>A conversation thus engaged was not likely to drop from want of interest on my side.
                We went to sit apart in a corner where no one interrupted us. In the course of our
                talk about Miss Haldin, Sophia Antonovna remarked suddenly —</p>

            <p>“I suppose you remember seeing me before? That evening when Natalia came to ask Peter
                Ivanovitch for the address of a certain Razumov, that young man who . . . .”</p>

            <p>“I remember perfectly,” I said. When Sophia Antonovna learned that I had in my
                possession that young man’s journal given me by Miss Haldin she became intensely
                interested. She did not conceal her curiosity to see the document.</p>

            <p>I offered to show it to her, and she at once volunteered to call on me next day for
                that purpose.</p>

            <p>She turned over the pages greedily for an hour or more, and then handed me the book
                with a faint sigh. While moving about Russia, she had seen Razumov too. He lived,
                not “in the centre,” but “in the south.” She described to me a little two-roomed
                wooden house, in the suburb of some very small town, hiding within the high
                plank-fence of a yard overgrown with nettles. He was crippled, ill, getting weaker
                every day, and Tekla the Samaritan tended him unweariedly with the pure joy of
                unselfish devotion. There was nothing in that task to become disillusioned
                about.</p>

            <p>I did not hide from Sophia Antonovna my surprise that she should have visited Mr.
                Razumov. I did not even understand the motive. But she informed me that she was not
                the only one.</p>

            <p>“Some of <hi>us</hi> always go to see him when passing through. He is intelligent. We
                has ideas. . . . He talks well, too.”</p>

            <p>Presently I heard for the first time of Razumov’s public confession in Laspara’s
                house. Sophia Antonovna gave me a detailed relation of what had occurred there.
                Razumov himself had told her all about it, most minutely.</p>

            <p>Then, looking hard at me with her brilliant black eyes —</p>

            <p>“There are evil moments in every life. A false suggestion enters one’s brain, and
                then fear is born — fear of oneself, fear for oneself. Or else a false courage — who
                knows? Well, call it what you like; but tell me, how many of them would deliver
                themselves up deliberately to perdition (as he himself says in that book) rather
                than go on living, secretly debased in their own eyes? How many? . . . And please
                mark this — he was safe when he did it. It was just when he believed himself safe
                and more — infinitely more — when the possibility of being loved by that admirable
                girl first dawned upon him, that he discovered that his bitterest railings, the
                worst wickedness, the devil work of his hate and pride, could never cover up the
                ignominy of the existence before him. There’s character in such a discovery.”</p>

            <p>I accepted her conclusion in silence. Who would care to question the grounds of
                forgiveness or compassion? However, it appeared later on, that there was some
                compunction, too, in the charity extended by the revolutionary world to Razumov the
                betrayer. Sophia Antonovna continued uneasily —</p>

            <p>“And then, you know, he was the victim of an outrage. It was not authorized. Nothing
                was decided as to what was to be done with him. He had confessed voluntarily. And
                that Nikita who burst the drums of his ears purposely, out on the landing, you know,
                as if carried away by indignation — well, he has turned out to be a scoundrel of the
                worst kind — a traitor himself, a betrayer — a spy! Razumov told me he had charged
                him with it by a sort of inspiration . . . .”</p>

            <p>“I had a glimpse of that brute,” I said. “How any of you could have been deceived for
                half a day passes my comprehension!”</p>

            <p>She interrupted me.</p>

            <p>“There! There! Don’t talk of it. The first time I saw him, I, too, was appalled. They
                cried me down. We were always telling each other, ‘Oh! you mustn’t mind his
                appearance.’ And then he was always ready to kill. There was no doubt of it. He
                killed — yes! in both camps. The fiend . . . .”</p>

            <p>Then Sophia Antonovna, after mastering the angry trembling of her lips, told me a
                very queer tale. It went that Councillor Mikulin, travelling in Germany (shortly
                after Razumov’s disappearance from Geneva), happened to meet Peter Ivanovitch in a
                railway carriage. Being alone in the compartment, these two talked together half the
                night, and it was then that Mikulin the Police Chief gave a hint to the
                Arch-Revolutionist as to the true character of the arch-slayer of gendarmes. It
                looks as though Mikulin had wanted to get rid of that particular agent of his own!
                He might have grown tired of him, or frightened of him. It must also be said that
                Mikulin had inherited the sinister Nikita from his predecessor in office.</p>

            <p>And this story, too, I received without comment in my character of a mute witness of
                things Russian, unrolling their Eastern logic under my Western eyes. But I permitted
                myself a question —</p>

            <p>“Tell me, please, Sophia Antonovna, did Madame de S—— leave all her fortune to Peter
                Ivanovitch?”</p>

            <p>“Not a bit of it.” The woman revolutionist shrugged her shoulders in disgust. “She
                died without making a will. A lot of nephews and nieces came down from St.
                Petersburg, like a flock of vultures, and fought for her money amongst themselves.
                All beastly Kammerherrs and Maids of Honour — abominable court flunkeys. Tfui!”</p>

            <p>“One does not hear much of Peter Ivanovitch now,” I remarked, after a pause.</p>

            <p>“Peter Ivanovitch,” said Sophia Antonovna gravely, “has united himself to a peasant
                girl.”</p>

            <p>I was truly astonished.</p>

            <p>“What! On the Riviera?”</p>

            <p>“What nonsense! Of course not.”</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna’s tone was slightly tart.</p>

            <p>“Is he, then, living actually in Russia? It’s a tremendous risk — isn’t it?” I cried.
                “And all for the sake of a peasant girl. Don’t you think it’s very wrong of
                him?”</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna preserved a mysterious silence for a while, then made a statement.
                “He just simply adores her.”</p>

            <p>“Does he? Well, then, I hope that she won’t hesitate to beat him.”</p>

            <p>Sophia Antonovna got up and wished me good-bye, as though she had not heard a word of
                my impious hope; but, in the very doorway, where I attended her, she turned round
                for an instant, and declared in a firm voice —</p>

            <p>“Peter Ivanovitch is an inspired man.”</p>
