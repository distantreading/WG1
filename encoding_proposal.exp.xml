        <body>
            <p>This is the first draft of a reference document defining the encoding scheme to be
                used for the European Literary Text Collection (ELTeC) which will be a major
                deliverable of COST Action 16204, <title>Distant Reading</title>. As a first draft
                it necessarily contains much uncertainty, either because policies have to be
                determined, or because issues are currently under-specified. Particular topics on
                which policy remains to be defined are signalled below with the label <q>Open
                    Question</q>. Input from other participants in the Action about these topics
                would be particularly useful.</p>
            <div>
                <head>Principles</head>
                <p>The MoU for the project points out that <q>Distant Reading methods cover a wide
                        range of computational methods for literary text analysis, such as
                        authorship attribution, topic modelling, character network analysis, or
                        stylistic analysis.</q> The focus of the ELTeC encoding scheme is thus not
                    to represent texts in all their original complexity of structure or appearance,
                    but rather to facilitate a richer and better-informed distant reading than a
                    transcription of its lexical content alone would permit. For example, it seems
                    useful to distinguish headings and annotations from the rest of the text, and to
                    be able to locate stretches of text within gross structural features such as
                    chapters and paragraphs. It is probably also useful to distinguish passages
                    belonging to different narrative levels (for example, direct speech versus
                    narrative or quotation versus narrative) and to identify reference points such
                    as page breaks. It is less useful to record exact nuances of rendition or
                    spelling in a particular version of a text. Our goal is not to duplicate the
                    work of scholarly editors or to produce (yet another) digital edition of a
                    specific source document.</p>
                <!-- CO: OK. With respect to the selection criteria, we need to consider that we will encode the first edition of each texts. 
               The first edition will reveal spelling variances and variances concerning different text levels, e.g, direct speech
               (like any other modern edition will do in some way or the other)-->
                <!-- LB : the idea of encoding specifically the first edition wasn't what I thought the
               brief was when I started work on this document! Licensing issues-->
                <p>In selecting features for inclusion in the markup scheme, we have been guided,
                    but not limited, by existing practice as far as possible. Particular collections
                    we have examined are listed in section <ptr target="#sources"/> but the main
                    goal has been to identify a small core set of essential textual features which
                    can be readily (preferably automatically) identified in existing digital
                    transcriptions, or easily and consistently provided by new transcriptions.</p>
                <!-- BN : I definitely agree:-->
                <p>This document lists all the textual features which are to be distinguished in an
                    ELTeC conformant transcription. Whenever a given feature exists in a text, it
                    will be marked up as indicated here. No other features will be captured by the
                    markup: if some textual feature not provided for here is identified by a marked
                    up source text, that markup will be removed. The goal is to ensure that the
                    ELTeC texts can be processed by very simple minded (but XML-aware) systems
                    primarily concerned with lexis and to make life easier for the developers of
                    such systems. </p>
                <!-- CO: In addition, our scheme should make sure that we have no variance in the actual encoding.
               Especially a fixed sequence of attributes and a fixed hierarchical structure of elements is needed for parsing issues. 
               For example, allowing diverging xpath may reveal problems for automatically processing ELTeC.  -->
                <!-- LB : I am assuming we will produce a tightly constrained XML schema to ensure that
               the hierarchy of XML elements is simple and predictable. We can't however do anything
               to enforce the order in which attributes appear on an XML tag, nor should we. And I
               don't know what you mean by "allowing diverging xpath": we can't control the
               structure of the documents we are encoding, just represent them! My
               assumption is that ELTeC documents will be well formed and valid XML documents: no
               more, but no less. What parsing issues are you imagining? -->
                <!-- CO: For this period, it may not be a frequent problem, but we also need to think of special character encoding:
               a full and extensive transcription guideline is needed. 
               We should further rely on UTF8 encoding. -->
                <!-- LB: Not sure what you mean here. Can you give an example? I am assuming we will use
              Unicode and UTF8. If we need anything beyond that we could use TEI <g> I suppose -->
                <p>We make no attempt to propose markup for linguistic annotations here. The
                    assumption is that this will be produced by different annotation systems in
                    different ways, though with an association between such annotations and the
                    basic lexical structures represented by the core ELTeC markup. </p>
                <!-- CO: These linguistic or any other annotations may be assigned in different formats. 
               Thus, the tei representation serves as a starting point for some other automatic annotations and analysis. I think, -->

                <head>Basic Transcription Guidelines</head>
                <!-- CO: General thoughts: I think, we should have in mind when the encoding can be done automatically 
               and when we need man power for encoding. -->
                <!-- LB : in what way ? this sounds like a workflow issue -->
                <p>The basic unit of the ELTeC corpus is the text of a single novel, represented by
                    a TEI <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element. We propose no
                    mechanism (other than metadata) to encode units larger than a single novel, such
                    as multipart novel series like Proust's <title>A la recherche du temps
                        perdu</title> or Balzac's <title>Les Rougon-Macquart</title>.</p>
                <p><label>Open Question</label> Should we include liminal matter (titlepages,
                    prefaces, appendixes...) in our transcriptions? The following policies seem
                    possible: <list>
                        <item>No : these typically belong to a particular edition or version of the
                            text, and should therefore systematically be excluded</item>
                        <item>Yes : these often form a significant part of the reader's experience
                            (cf. the foreword to most editions of <title>David Copperfield</title>).
                            Mark them up using <gi>front</gi> and <gi>back</gi> as
                            appropriate.</item>
                        <!-- CO: As we would like to propose the use of first editions, we represent the
                     original version. Additionally, I know studies where these non-continuous texts 
                     are analyzed to investigate and question traditional classifications of text genres.  
                  -->
                        <!-- LB : what do you mean by "non-continuous"? -->
                        <!-- BN: From my point of view, liminal matter should not be included in the
               transcription. I think this information is related to the book as physical object,
               but the project is focused on the novel, on the content of the book. At least at the
               moment I think this information is not useful for a distant reading. -->
                        <item>Sort of : do not transcribe them, but indicate that they have been
                            suppressed by using the <gi>gap</gi> element.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Within the body of a text, major structural divisions (parts, sections, chapters
                    etc.) will be captured using the generic <ref target="#TEI.div"
                        >&lt;div&gt;</ref> element, with attributes <hi rend="att">type</hi>, <hi
                        rend="att">xml:lang</hi>, <hi rend="att">xml:id</hi> and <hi rend="att"
                        >n</hi> used as further detailed below.</p>
                <p>The names used for hierarchic structural divisions of a novel above the chapter
                    are arbitrary, culture-specific, and often inconsistent : in some novels things
                    called <q>part</q> contain things called <q>book</q> and in others the reverse.
                    We propose to follow TEI in using a single element (<ref target="#TEI.div"
                        >&lt;div&gt;</ref>) for every hierarchical structural division, down to the
                    level of <q>chapter</q>.</p>
                <p><label>Open Question</label> Is it useful to retain the name used for each level
                    in the original source (the type of div) ? <list>
                        <!-- CO: Maybe I just missed this information. We can keep the structuring texts/words of the text as headings.
                     We can mark them with the appropriate element. In this way, we can keep the information without having to define 
                     a fixed list of subdivisions in a novel (you alreay pointed out that this is not possible). Having marked the existing 
                     headings (and subheadings) they can be included or ignored automatically when processing the document.  -->
                        <!-- LB : I think it would be problematic to just use <head> without using <div>
                     if that's what you are suggesting. I am only asking whether or not we
                     include e.g. @type="chapter" on the top level div -->
                        <!-- BN: I'm not sure. Maybe it could be a good solution the third one:-->
                        <item>Yes: it is easy to keep and may help referencing : use the <hi
                                rend="att">type</hi> attribute to hold the name used for each level
                            of div in the work in question</item>
                        <item>No : this name adds no useful information beyond the level indicated
                            by the XML structure </item>
                        <item>No : it would be more useful to provide an explicit and normalised
                            indication of the hierarchic level for the benefit of non-XML-aware
                            processors (e.g. <code>level1</code>, <code>level2</code> etc.)</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>The (human) language in which a text is expressed is indicated explicitly by the
                        <hi rend="att">xml:lang</hi> attribute which supplies the ISO 2 letter code
                    for the language concerned. This attribute will always be supplied on the <ref
                        target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref> element to specify a default, and may
                    also appear on other elements, for example <gi>foreign</gi>, to indicate
                    passages where the language changes. The various different languages used in a
                    given text will be itemized in its metadata (see <ref target="#TEI.langUsage"
                        >&lt;langUsage&gt;</ref> element in the header).</p>
                <p><label>Open question</label> Should passages exhibiting regional or dialectal
                    variation be specially signalled? <list>
                        <item>No : this is too fine grained and controversial a distinction to be
                            made with reliable consistency </item>
                        <item>Yes : treat this in the same way as any other kind of code switching
                            and define a set of appropriate language codes for the project</item>
                        <!-- CO: From a linguistic point of view, I would like to say yes but detecting dialectal variation 
                     is something which cannot be done automatically. I think, without a more explicit guidelines concerning 
                     the detection of foreign material we might end up with confusing analysis. The
                     definition of the element foreign is broad. For example,
                     neoclassic words may or may not count as foreign. Especially in a corpus containing roman and germanic languages.  -->
                        <!-- BN: This annotation could be complex. I think it will be better to annotate
dialectal variations during linguistic annotation.-->
                        <!-- LB : maybe we should just use foreign for passages which are signalled
                     specially in some way in the text. e.g. in italics -->
                        <item>Maybe : just use the <gi>distinct</gi> element to indicate the kind of
                            variation concerned</item>
                        <!-- CO: This element may then be applied to other distinct phenomena as well. I
               think this is not the best way. -->
                        <!-- LB: Many TEI elements have multiple uses, so this is not an argument against using
                  <distinct> in my view-->
                    </list></p>
                <p>A single reference scheme will be defined for the whole corpus, with the
                    following components: <list>
                        <item>text identifier : every text will have an identifier consisting of its
                            two letter language code and a three digit serial number, for example
                                <code>FR042</code></item>
                        <item>chapter identifier: each chapter or equivalent will have an identifier
                            concatenating the text identifier and a three digit serial number, for
                            example <code>FR042012</code> is the twelfth chapter of the 42nd French
                            novel.</item>
                        <item>If sub-chapter segmentation (see below) is implemented, then the
                            segments will append a further four digit serial number.</item>
                        <!--  CO: In addition, each other part of the book may also get an identifier too (table of contents etc.).  
               -->
                        <!-- LB: assuming that they are included, yes, they will. Do we really want to
                     include tables of contents? -->
                    </list>The identifier will be supplied as the value of an <hi rend="att"
                        >xml:id</hi> attribute on each <ref target="#TEI.text">&lt;text&gt;</ref>,
                        <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref> or <gi>s</gi> element as
                    appropriate. Adding this identifier is an easily automated task which can be
                    built into the workflow for accession to the ELTeC.</p>
                <p>Note that these identifiers will not necessarily correspond with the numbering
                    used in a particular source text. In a work where the first twelve chapters are
                    considered to form part one, and the next twelve constitute part two, the first
                    chapter of the second part will have an identifier ending <code>013</code>, even
                    though it may be numbered <code>1</code> in a source text.</p>
                <!-- CO: good idea. -->
                <p><label>Open question</label> is it important to preserve the original numbering,
                    particularly for deeply structured texts? <list>
                        <item>Yes : the original numbering is widely used to reference the text: it
                            should be supplied as using the <hi rend="att">n</hi> attribute on the
                                <ref target="#TEI.div">&lt;div&gt;</ref>.</item>
                        <!-- CO: we may use here the "head" element as the numbering of a chapter may be analysed as a head, maybe next to other heads. See comment above-->
                        <!-- BN: I'm not sure. Sometimes scholars refer to specific passages by original numbering ("The chapter two of Don Quixote bla bla bla"). In this case
this information is necessary. -->
                        <!-- LB: head is not the same as @n : I agree with Borja -->
                        <item>No : the original numbering and referencing scheme are of no use in
                            our intended applications, introduce unnecessary complexity, and may be
                            a source of confusion. </item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>The chapters of a novel mostly consist of prose, arranged in paragraphs, for
                    which we will use the TEI <ref target="#TEI.p">&lt;p&gt;</ref> element. It is
                    not unusual to find other structures however, specifically verse, or passages of
                    dialogue presented as if in a play, with speaker labels and even stage
                    directions. Less frequently, novels may contain material presented in list or
                    tabular formats. Graphics with their own associated heading or other text are
                    also frequent.</p>

                <p>Novels are also full of direct speech, represented using various different
                    conventions, but almost always distinguished from the narrative voice. The first
                    person narrative is also common, but may be regarded as a special case.

                        <q>distant reading</q> style analyses. It might therefore be helpful to

                <p>Printed texts typically deploy a number of conventions which can cause problems
                    for linguistic analyses of even the most basic kind. Changes of font or style
                    (italicization or use of superscript, for example) can have particular lexical
                    significance which should be taken into account. End-of-line hyphenation can
                    make it harder to identify the exact form of a token. Non-standard (i.e.
                    non-modern) spellings can mislead parsers. Our proposed encoding aims above all
                    for consistency and transparency in what is reliably achievable, leaving more
                    difficult and problematic issues to be addressed by linguistic annotations. </p>
                <p>We do not preserve the lineation of running prose in our source texts, since this
                    is always purely an artefact of the source edition. For the same reason we will
                    reassemble words broken across a line break, silently removing any hyphen
                    present. (This will make it impossible to use our texts for hyphenation studies.
                    So be it.) </p>

                            to anchor links to an image of the source text) which is usually

                        <!-- BN: From my point of view this information is not necessary. As I said
before, it is related to the book as physical object, not to the novel itself.-->
                        <item>No : the proposed uses don't justify the cost of providing the
                            information if it is missing. And pagination is inherently
                            copy-specific.</item>
                    </list></p>
                <p>Font and style variations in the source text usually signal something. Italics
                    may signal emphasis, quotation, foreign language terms etc. Superscripts almost
                    always signal abbreviation. The visual salience of these variations is of
                    considerably less interest to distant readers than the intended function they
                    signal. However, it is not always easy to determine that function reliably and
                    consistently by algorithm. Some simple cases could however be addressed. A
                    possibly strategy is outlined below. It assumes the existence of a digital
                    version of the text in which visual features are explicit, whether by means of
                    TEI-style markup or styling information such as that provided by Word. <list>

                    <head>Encoding description</head>
                    <p>The TEI allows for the specification of encoding practice, by which is meant
                        documentation of the specific editorial policies followed during
                        transcription (treatment of printed hyphens, lexical normalisation, sampling
                        procedures, features included, ignored, or normalised, etc.). Such
                        specification may be supplied at the individual document level, or once for
                        all across the whole of a corpus. It is even possible to specify that
                        different parts of a document follow different policies, provided that all
                        the available policies are defined somewhere. </p>
                    <p><label>Open Question</label> : We propose as far as possible not to allow for
                        any variation in encoding policies applied within the ELTeC. We will still
                        need to determine our encoding policies, of course, and to document them
                        appropriately in the ELTeC corpus header, but there should be no need for
                        separate specifications at the document level.</p>

                <head>Linguistic and semantic annotation</head>
                <p>Later stages of the project will need to use additional markup facilities to
                    represent more sophisticated annotations, which may be motivated linguistically
                    (for example, to provide a normalised form, part of speech, etc.) or
                    semantically (for example to distinguish proper names, names of people, places,
                    events, etc.). These will form an additional layer, not discussed here: the
                    principle should however be that the base text we provide is always available in
                    a uniform encoding.</p>

                                        terminological work, there is frequently discussion over
                                        whether terms must be atomic or may include multi-word
                                        lexical items, symbolic designations, or phraseological

                                        element may be used to mark any of these. No position is
                                        taken on the philosophical issue of what a term can be; the

                                        can be used to provide normalized values of temporal
                                        information. By default, the attributes from the <ident
                                            type="class">att.datable.w3c</ident> class are provided.
                                        If the module for names &amp; dates is loaded, this class
                                        also provides attributes from the <ident type="class"
                                            >att.datable.iso</ident> and <ident type="class"

                                        datatypes form a subset of those values available via the
                                        ISO 8601 standard. However, the greater expressiveness of
                                        the ISO datatypes may not be needed, and there exists much
                                        greater software support for the W3C datatypes.</p></cell>
