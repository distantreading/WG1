LIFE OF A FAST YOUNG LADY.

CHAPTER I.

A yellow fog in London! We all know
from experience what that is, have felt the
overwhelming influence of the cold, clammy
pressure, the weight and depression it ever
exercises over the spirits, the gloom it casts
on every surrounding object, magnifying,
to an unsupportable degree, the troubles
which may chance at the moment to lie
most heavily on the heart.

It was on a morning when our metropolis

wore its most sombre garb—that dark
covering which may well cause our foreign
neighbours to look upon us with such un-
feigned commiseration, no longer wondering
at our dull and apathetic natures—the gas
lamps scarcely seeming to lend any assist-
ance in irradiating the thick orange-co-
loured darkness of the atmosphere, that
a cab was suddenly stopped as it turned
into an obscure street, and without waiting
for the assistance of the driver, an arm was
thrust out of the window, the door of the
vehicle burst open, and a man springing out,
closely enveloped in a great coat, his face
buried in the thick folds of the shawl
about his neck, helped or rather dragged
forth, his companion, also covered with a
large cloak, and whose countenance was
concealed by an impenetrable veil, and
then ordered the cabman to wait there until
the ladies returned. This done, he walked

on without offering any further notice, the
lady following, as also an elderly woman,
who had been one of the occupants of the
cab.

Along dirty streets, they traversed with
difficulty, keeping up with the rapid, im-
patient steps of their conductor, until they
reached the gate of an old tumble-down
church, in an obscure precinct, into which
the man at once stalked. The clergyman
and clerk were waiting in readiness to re-1
ceive the party, and the gentleman, for
such, notwithstanding his disguise, he un-
mistakably appeared, walked hurriedly to
the Communion-table, seemingly little heed-
ing whether his bride elect was doing the
same; but at length, impatiently turning
round, and perceiving that she stood mo-
tionless in the doorway, he strode hastily
towards her, and said, in anything but a:
conciliatory tone of voice,

“ For heaven’s, sake come on! let it be
done, and that quickly.”

The lady thus urged obeyed, although
those who looked on might have perceived
that she trembled so violently that her
limbs had scarcely power to sustain her
faltering steps.

The person who accompanied her, and
she was evidently intended to play the part
of witness, now took her place by the side
of the bride, the clerk having been deputed
to give her away.

What a bridal it was! In that wretched,
worm-eaten church, the deep orange-tinted
fog rendering the whole scene so obscure
that the clergyman must indeed have known
the service well by rote, or he could not
have distinguished a word in the Prayer-
book he held in his hand—scarcely the
countenances of those standing before him.

The ceremony, performed in a most

slovenly manner, and contracted to its
shortest limits, was soon ended, and the
couple pronounced man and wife.

“ There is something more to be done,
I suppose,” exclaimed the bridegroom, in
an impatient tone of voice, taking no notice
of his newly-made wife, whose emotion was
beginning to be so apparent, that the
woman who accompanied her stepped for-
ward to offer her assistance.

The gentleman was informed that he must
sign his name in the register, and into the
vestry he stalked, leaving the lady to follow.

Seeing that she hesitated, the clergyman
accosted her, and she was about to be
ushered into the dark, small closet bearing
the name of vestry, when she encountered
the bridegroom hurriedly issuing from it,
he having done his part even in that short
moment.

The lady murmured a name quite in-

audible from agitation, as she eagerly
caught hold of his arm to arrest his flight.

“ You must not leave me thus,” she im-
ploringly said. “ Are we indeed thus to
part, and for ever?”

“ Did you not consent that it should be
so, Linda ?” he harshly replied; “ you knew
how it was to be, and having fulfilled your
promise, we do now part, and as far as I can
see, will never meet again”

And with cruel force he extricated her
hands from the light grasp with which she
had endeavoured to detain him, and after
having thrust money to defray the necessary
fees into the hands of the clergyman who
had officiated at these ill-omened nuptials, he
hurriedly left the church, apparently little
heeding the shriek of agony which burst
from the lips of her to whom he had just
pledged himself that death should only part
them.

The poor girl, for such she appeared,
when the veil was removed in order that
water might be sprinkled on her death-like
face, was kindly ministered to by the per-
son who had accompanied her.

She was made to swallow a little wine
which was kept in the vestry for sacra-
mental purposes, and by degrees revived
sufficiently to sign her name and be as-*
sisted into the cab which was still awaiting
them.

Not a word passed from the white lips of
the bride during the long, miserable drive;
she sat motionless, her hands clasped, her
eyes dilated, fixed on vacancy, the very image
of dark despair. Such a bride! this wretched-
looking young creature, with masses of dark
brown hair hanging in confusion about
her face, her dress neglected, no sign or
trace of aught but misery; and the dense,
cold, humid atmosphere penetrating through

the badly closed windows, pressing with its
freezing influence upon the already over-
charged feelings.

At length the cab stopped at a small
house in one of the insignificant streets
leading out of Bloomsbury Square.

“ For goodness’ sake! make haste and get
a pan of coals to warm the young lady’s
bed, Sarah,” was the order given as they
entered the door.

“ And now, my dear, we must put you
to bed, you are chilled to death,” was the
proposition made by the good woman to
whose house they had just returned.

: The girl shook her head, and then at-
tempted to rise from the chair on which
she had thrown herself on first entering
the little parlour, but the trembling limbs
refused to perform their office, and she
sank back, for the first time that morning
tears coming to her relief; but tempo-

rary relief only they proved, for soon con-
vulsive sobs burst forth anew, which at
first she tried hard to restrain, but her
emotion rose far beyond her control, and
a violent fit of hysterics ensued, which
only ceased when complete prostration of
strength caused the poor sufferer to fall
into a state of stupor.

In this condition she was undressed and
removed to the next room, placed in a
small bed which she had before occupied,
and soon sank into a profound and death-
like sleep.

Then, as Mrs. Davis sat down for the
first time that day to refresh herself with a
cup of tea, after such a morning as she had
never before passed, she pondered gravely
and sadly over the perplexing scene she
had just witnessed. Mrs. Davis was a re-
tired servant, and had amassed sufficient
means to take a small house, the upper part

Digitized by LjOOQie

of which she let, retaining the parlours for
herself.

We must take the liberty of repeating
aloud her cogitations, as she consoled her-
self with that innocent solace of the per-
plexed, that beverage so out of favour
with ouT modem Esculapians, but which
nevertheless has continued for many gene-
rations to be the comfort of our lives.

Yes, a cup of tea, why should not son-
nets be written in its defence and praise,
as well as to so many far less worthy
objects ?

And whilst the good woman sat sipping
and cogitating, her eyes happened to fall
upon a letter on the chimney-piece.

“ A letter, I declare, for Miss Linda! ”
she exclaimed, as she reached it down and
began to examine it with her eyes and
manipulate it with her fingers, “ and 1
verily believe there are bank-notes within.

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

So much the better. Well, I’ll just go and
look at the poor thing,” Mrs. Davis added,
her spirits beginning to rise at the dis-
covery, “ but not give her the letter just
yet;” and so saying, she opened a door of
the folding ones dividing the little parlours,
and noiselessly walked to the side of a small
press-bed on which the unfortunate girl was
lying.

She was in a profound sleep, her hair
thrown back, disclosing a small oval face and
well-shaped forehead. The features ap-
peared regular enough, but the mouth was
compressed and rather distorted, as if with
pain; the complexion of a hue so livid that
what its real tint might have been could not
be guessed, and under the eyes might be
seen dark shades of the deepest violet;
suffering, indeed, marked the whole cha-
racter of the countenance. But she seemed
very young—one arm was drooping over

12

PASSAGES IK THE LIFE OF

the low bed; but it was well formed, the
hand small and taper, its third finger
encircled by the symbol of her new position
—that type of weal or woe—the wedding
ring.

But it was evidently not fitted for the
finger on which it had been placed; for, as
the hand hung almost lifelessly in the posi-
tion in which the arm had been despair-
ingly flung, the circlet, so far too large, even
whilst Mrs. Davis stood and gazed, dropped
on the ground. Mrs. Davis shook her head
portentously as she picked it up.

“ This is no good omen,” she thought—
“ a bad business from first to last—and what
Pm to do, I’m sure I can’t tell. I always
liked the poor child; but I’m a lone woman,
and must take care of myself, and not bring
discredit on my lodgings. Oh! that
plaguing bell!” as there came a peal at the
street door; “ the newspaper for the people

upstairs. I hope it won’t wake this poor
thing.”

And Mrs. Davis hustled out to receive
the paper, which she always took the liberty
of peeping into before she sent it upstairs.

“ Well, I declare! ” she said, as she rapidly
ran her spectacled eyes over the columns,
scanning here and there what to her were
the most interesting pieces of intelligence.
Having lived all her life in great families,
she still had a hankering after their doings,
reading with interest every account of
fashionable entertainments, arrivals, depar-
tures, marriages, deaths, and births, dwell-
ing with old feelings of deference upon
great names associated with reminscences
of former times, when she was an import-
ant housekeeper, presiding over an aristo-
cratic establishment — well remembered
forms, faces, and histories, connected with
many a noble name, appearing now before

her as they presented themselves to her
sight in the columns of the “ Morning
Post/’ as “bright dreams of the past;” for
though it had ever been Mrs. Davis’s ambi-
tion to have a home of her own, she still
fondly dwelt in imagination upon the “ flesh
pots of Egypt,” a contrast assuredly to hef
present mode of life, a lodging-house keeper
on a small scale. “ But home is home, be
it ever so homely,” was the housekeeper’s
consolatory reflection when the lodgers up-
stairs were u worreting,” or the maid of all
work incorrigibly dirty.

But to return to Mrs. Davis’s exclama-
tion, as her eye caught one particular name
amongst the arrivals.

“ Well, I declare, if the Countess of Sun-
derland has not returned to Carlton Gar-
dens ; a strange time of year for her to leave
Belfield; but,” she added, “ a thought has
struck me. I’ll just go off this evening, and

advise with her what is to be done with
Miss Linda; they can’t have cast her off
after all the work the family have made
about her. Oh, there’s the drawing-room
bell; what a hurry those people always are
in for their paper, just as if it signifies
whether they have it a few minutes sooner
or later.”

And away she bustled to deliver the
“ Morning Post,” and ask what was re*
quired for dinner.

CHAPTER II.

It was late in the day before the miserable
inmate of the inner parlour opened her
eyes—she had slept the sleep of utter ex-
haustion. Her first impulse was to start
up and look wildly around her, the next
to press her hand upon her forehead, as if
to recall recollection. With a shiver, she
hurriedly looked at the third finger of her
left hand, and then clasping both hands to-
gether, she raised her eyes to Heaven,
ejaculating:

“ Thank God! Then it cannot be.”

Mrs. Davis, who had been anxiously
watching for her awakening, hearing the

17

sound of her voice, was in an instant by
her side.

“ Oh! Mrs. Davis,” Linda exclaimed, “ I
have had such a terrible dream; but is it
really only a dream ?” she added, looking
anxiously at her, “for, thank God, thank
God, I have no ring upon my finger!”

“ Never mind your dream, my dear, but
just drink this cup of tea; I have put a
taste of brandy in it—for you’ll die from
want.”

“ Die! ” the girl exclaimed, wildly; “ and
why not, pray? Why should I live ?”

“ Oh, that’s not pretty talk,” Mrs. Davis
replied, as she stood by the bed, and in-
sisted upon every drop of the tea being
swallowed, and a small piece of toast. “ And
now lie still again, and try to have another
nap. I am obliged to go out by and by on
a little business, so it’s no use your troubling
yourself by getting up.”

Linda fell back upon the pillow,, and
began to meditate. The shades of sleep were
passing away, her mind and perception
beginning to become clearer; die started
up and looked around.

“Yes, it is no dream,” she at kx^th
drearily exclaimed. “ There is my bonnet
and cloak; my clothes just thrown upon Mrs.
Davis’s bed. Oh 1 it is no dream,” she almost
shrieked. “ Mrs. Davis, oh, come here. Oh!
what shall I do ? what shall I do? But, the
ring! the ring! It is not here; and as sure as
that I am lying upon this bed he put it on
my finger. Oh! Mrs. Davis, come quickly.”

“ Well, this is a pretty business,” the
good woman murmured, as she bustled in,
and found her charge in a state of excite-
ment almost amounting to frenzy.

“ So it is true after all, and no dream,”
Linda cried; “ but where is the ring V she
demanded.

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

“ Why, for the matter of that, I’ve got
it; it dropped off your finger as your hand
hung down when you were asleep. Yes, it
is all too true, poor child} you are married,
for certain sure j for all he looked so fierce
and crazy, he is your husband, for good and
all, but no doubt it will come right in the
end. He’ll come back again, so don’t fret.”

Linda turned abruptly in the bed, and
covered her face with the clothes, smother-
ing as she did so a cry of despair. Then
again she spoke—

“ Give me that ring, Mrs. Davis.”

On receiving it, she immediately put it
on, placing over it a handsome turquoise
guard, which she removed from another
finger, then returned to her former atti-
tude, hiding her face from observation, and
remaining so still that Mrs. Davis hoped
she had once more fallen asleep, and making
her preparations for going out as noiselessly

as possible, she soon sallied forth, desiring
the maid servant to look now and then after
the young lady. When the house door
closed with its usual sound, Linda uncovered
her face, again looked around, and again
came the despairing words :

“ Oh! what can I do ? I cannot stay here;
I must go; hut where ? I can never show
my face again. I am disgraced for ever hy
this badge,” and she looked at the wedding
ring. “Oh! why did he make me marry
him?”

She lay some time meditating profoundly.
Sarah peeped in, full of curiosity about the
young lady, suspecting from the occurrences
of the morning that some wonderful mys-
tery was going forward. She saw that
Linda’s eyes were wide open, so thought
she might venture a word or two.

“ Are you better, Miss ?” she inquired.
“ Can I get you anything ?”

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

21

“ No,” was the abrupt answer; and
Sarah, leaving the door open, went into the
front parlour to fidget about the fire; pre-
sently she again approached the bed.

“ If you please, Miss, I think this letter
is for you; I found it on the mantelpiece.”

Linda started up, and seized the letter
held to her by the maid.

“Bring a candle quickly,” she gasped;
“ and now go,” she added, as one was placed
in her hand.

These words she read:

“You have performed your rash pro-
mise—the law binds you to me as a wife—
to the extinction of every hope of happi-
ness to either of us—but you have brought
all this upon yourself, Linda, by your
blind, weak affection for a brute—an un-
principled villain,—such I freely acknow-
ledge myself to be; you will, however, never
see me again; henceforth we must be as

strangers. I owe you a deep debt of grati-
tude for having, by this sacrifice of yourself,
freed me from the yoke of a galling chain,
which, however, has already eaten into my
heart, leaving me a shattered wreck, in
mind almost a madman. Our marriage
will be duly recorded in the papers, and
then, God help you, Linda! you will receive
no quarter from my side of the house; at
least not from my mother, and my father
is always powerless; and your own friends
will be indignant. You will require pro-
tection, but I know not where to advise
your seeking it. Yes, you may well ex-
claim against my brutality, my reckless
selfishness towards -one so young, so good,
so worthy of better things; but, Linda, I
am mad, my brain is on fire, my whole
being in a state which my mind cannot
control. Draw upon my banker for one
hundred pounds quarterly, that is all I can

at present spare you from my allowance.
In case of present need, I enclose notes
amounting to the first quarter. God protect
you, Linda! We shall never meet again.”

There was no signature to this cruel
document. Linda read it over and over
again, and whilst so doing her countenance
■underwent a complete change; its paleness
vanished, the brightest crimson usurped its
place, her eyes flashed with indignant fire.

At length she crushed the paper in her
hand, and setting her small teeth with
fierce anger, sprang from the bed, and
hastily commenced dressing herself.

“ See me again !” she murmured, “ no,
never! Truly so he says,—and he holds that
out to me as a threat. Did I ask him to
marry me ? Such a thought never entered
my mind, until, for his sake, to save him
from ruin, I madly consented. And his
money!” she continued, spurning indig-

with its enclosure, which had fallen on the
floor; “ his money, I’ll have none of it,—
no, not if I am starving, and have to beg
my daily food—not I.” Hastily as her
trembling hands could lend their assistance
she dressed herself, and then proceeded
to fill a carpet-bag. The contents of her
purse were anxiously examined, some
sovereigns and silver poured forth upon
the table, and then replaced.

“ I cannot spare any of this,” she said,
in a softened tone, “ and yet I must leave
something for Mrs. Davis, so kind as she

thought had struck her, she opened a box
in which were trinkets; sighing deeply as
she examined them separately, she said,
“Ah, this 1 cannot give — nor this—nor
this—they are all so dear to me, for the
sake of those who gave them—and these

she selected a very handsome one — this
I will leave as a gift for the dear old
woman; I care not for that great man who
gave it to me because I sang so well that
night—oh, that night!” and she wrung
her hands as if stung by some painful
recollection.

Th* costly brooch was placed in a small
box atd enclosed to Mrs. Davis with a few
scrawled lines.

“ I lave no money to spare, dear Mrs.

“ Linda.”

“ And ibw I must go,” the girl ex-

“ I must hide my head somewhere, any-

she continued, her fierce mood in a moment
changing, “ what have I done so very, very
bad to be thus treated ? Foolish, thought-
less, easily led, I have been; but oh! not
wicked.” Tears now fell in torrents ss she
put on her cloak and bonnet.

“ what am I to do ? but I had almost for-

if she were touching some noxious reptile,
she picked up the letter which still re-
mained disregarded on the floor, “ this
must be done.”

She refolded and placed if in an en-
velope, with its enclosure of bank notes—
directed and securely sealed it. “ Now I

She stood for some minutes transfixed,
her young white face transformed, painful
to contemplate, disfigured as it was by
the unnatural feelings which convulsed her
heart. “ But I must go,” she again said,
“ Mrs. Davis will soon return.” The box
containing her trinkets was hurriedly
added to the contents of the carpet-bag.
“ I shall want these probably to obtain
bread,” she murmured; then opening the
door gently, she saw Sarah ascending the
stairs, bearing the large tray containing the
lodgers’ dinner, and then, stealing from the
room and opening the street door, went
forth into the dark foggy atmosphere of a
December evening.

Mrs. Davis, much perplexed in mind, had
set out on her expedition to Carlton Gar-
dens, an omnibus conveying her within a
short distance from her destination.

“ Well, Thomas,” she said to the porter
who admitted her, “ so the family are come
to town—rather early for them, is it not ?”

“ My lady is the only one who is staying
here, but Lord Sinclair is expected this
evening — her ladyship does not intend to
make any long stay, I believe.”

“ Can I see my lady ? ” Mrs. Davis de-
manded, “ 1 am come to speak to her upon
a matter of particular business.”

The porter called to a footman and de-
sired him to ask the lady’s maid whether
her ladyship could see Mrs. Davis. The
ex-housekeeper was not long kept waiting;
she was informed that she might go imme-
diately to her ladyship’s dressing-room.

Lady Sunderland kindly greeted her old
servant, who had served her long and
faithfully. “ Well, Mrs. Davis,” she said,
after the first greetings were over, “ what
is it that you wish so particularly to say to
me ? Sit down and let me hear.”

“ Well, my lady,” Mrs. Davis began,
“ I am in a very worried state, I can assure
you, and it is all about Miss Linda! ”

“ Miss Linda! ” the lady exclaimed, with
much excitement, “ for Heaven’s sake what
of her ? We are all in much distress and

about it.”

u I fear, my lady, you may say that I
have done very wrong, and I daresay,—
indeed, I am sure I have, but I really was
taken so by surprise that I scarcely knew
what I did, and indeed I had no option; I
was obliged to go.”

“ Go where ? pray say at once what, it is,
for I am really most anxious, Mrs. Davis,”
demanded Lady Sunderland.

“ To the church to see her married, my
lady.”

“ Married! and to whom ? ” was the ex-
cited exclamation.

“ That I cannot tell,” Mrs. Davis con-
tinued, “ but it will be all down in the
register book.”

“ At what church was the ceremony per-
formed ? ”

“ Upon my word, my lady, for the life

of me I cannot tell; we went a long way,
and the fog was so thick that I could see
nothing at all—a dismal old place a long
way off it seemed, that’s all I can say.”

“ But,” said Lady Sunderland, knowing
from experience that she had better let
Mrs. Davis relate the story in her own way,
“ tell me all about it from the beginning;
I will not interrupt you.”

“ Well, my lady, this is the true ac-
count. The day before yesterday, about
eight o’clock in the evening, a cab stopped
at my door; says I, that’s not for us, the
lodgers are gone out for the day—but soon
there came a loud ring at the street bell; I
heard the steps let down, and in another
moment, Sarah having opened the door, who
should stand before me but Miss Linda,
looking as white as a ghost. ‘Miss Linda,’
said I, ‘ where in the world do you come
from?’

“ * Dear Mrs. Davis,’ said she, ‘ will you
take me in for a few nights?’

“ ‘ Take you in, my dear, what do you
mean?’

“ * Why, give me a bed only for a few
days. Say quickly, will you or will you
not? for I must get into that cab and
go elsewhere.’

“ ‘ I was taken so all of a heap that I an-
swered, ‘ Well, I’ll try, dear, but why not go
to Carlton Gardens?’

“ ‘ Carlton Gardens! ’ she almost shrieked,
‘never, never! say at once, Mrs. Davis,
yes or no,’ and she stamped with her foot.

“ And then I remembered the little press-
bed in my room that I could make up for •
her. I could not turn the child into the
street at that time of night; so she paid
the cab, and her carpet-bag was taken in.

“ I was shocked and sorry when I looked
at the poor thing, so changed was she, and

with a strange look upon her face; her
eyes staring so wildly, and such a dark ex*
pression about her countenance altogether.

((I said,‘What is the matter, Miss Linda?
I thought you were in Scotland, with your
uncle.’

“ Then she started up, quite frightening
me out of my senses, and catching hold of
my hands, cried,1 Mrs. Davis, I beseech, I
implore you to ask no questions, but let me
stay here a few days, and then I shall go,
and be no more trouble to you or any one.’

“Upon my word, I thought, this is a
pretty business—some scrape the child has
got into; what will all her friends say to
this? But of one thing I’m sure, they would
think no harm of me for taking her in for
a night or two, whatever she may have
done, and so I set about making her a cup
of tea, and getting the little press-bed
ready, for indeed she looked fit to drop. I

soon got her to bed, she never speaking a
word, but looking so miserable.”

“You did most kindly, Mrs. Davis,”
Lady Sunderland said, with much feeling.
“ This is indeed a sad story.”

“ Yes, and I haven't come to half the
worst part of it, my lady. All the next day
she sat looking the picture of misery, start*
ing at every sound, doing nothing but occa*
sionally looking into a Bradshaw which lay
on the table. I tried to get her to talk,
but it was of no use. Sarah told me, when
I was out she wrote a letter and put it into
the box herself—we have one close at hand.
When we went to bed that night, she said,
‘ You must let me stay a day or two longer,
Mrs. Davis, I have not yet quite settled my
plans.* I told her that there was no hurry,
only I wished I could see her more cheerful.
‘Cheerful!’ she repeated, and laughed; but
I would as soon have heard her cry, as give

such a laugh as that. Well, and so three
days passed. This morning was so dark, with
such a fog—I question whether I ever saw
a worse one—that we did not sit down to
breakfast till nearly nine. I had not tasted
a mouthful before a cab rushed up to the
door, a violent ring came next, and then
the door suddenly opened, and in walked a
man. ‘ Linda! ’ he said, in a harsh sort of
voice,(make haste and come with me, all
is ready waiting for our marriage.’

“ Miss Linda, who had started up, look-
ing whiter than ever, now covered her
face with her hands, and gave a sort of
cry.

“ ‘ Yes, we are to be married; you re-
member your promise, and you know the
conditions.’ — ‘ For Heaven’s sake,’ he
added, stamping his foot impatiently, ‘ put
on your bonnet without any further delay,-
and you, Madam, had better come with us,

D 2

Digitized by LjOOQie
36

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

to see that all is right, that we are joined
together for ever and for aye.’

“ Oh, in what a sneering, jeering tone
were these words spoken! To my surprise
Miss Linda walked deliberately into the
next room, and put on her bonnet and
cloak, and then again the gentleman said:
‘ And you, Madam, pray make haste, the
parson and clerk are both waiting to
Solemnise these auspicious nuptials.’ I
felt as if I were spell-bound, so I obeyed*
put on my things, shivering with cold,
.and not having had a bit or sup in my
poor stomach that blessed morning; and
was thrust into the cab with Miss Linda
by the gentleman, who jumped in after us.

“‘Drive on, you know where,’ he said
to the cabman, and we did drive on, In
all my life I never had such a drive; the
cold so bitter, the fog so dense, we were
almost in darkness, Miss Linda, poor

thing, trembling and shaking by my side,
and that naan—what he was even like I
could not tell, so buttoned up and shawled
was he, and his hat slouched over his face.
Not a word was spoken by any of us, good,
bad, or indifferent, and when the cab
stopped, it was as dark as night. All I
can say is that this fellow, whoever he
may be, is a wretch without a spark of
feeling.”

Mrs. Davis then gave a graphic descrip-
tion of what we have already related, end-
ing by saying, “ If that man is not a wicked
one, or a madman, I’m much mistaken,
and I am very grieved to think I had not
sent for the police, and had him taken up,
instead of allowing him to drag me with
that poor child to witness such a disgrace-
ful business.”

Lady Sunderland looked inexpressibly

shocked; she was silent from emotion for
some minutes, and then said:

“ It is a pity, indeed, that this marriage
was allowed to take place.”

“ Yes, my lady, it was, And I sorely
repent not having endeavoured to prevent
it; my only excuse is, that from Miss
Linda’s state of mind I verily believed
something wrong had happened; and I -
thought, perhaps, that marriage was the
best thing to be done; and, indeed, if you
had heard the man, how he commanded us,
we could not choose but to obey.”

“ And you have left Linda, you say, in
bed?”

“ Yes, and I hope asleep; the ruffian
declared they should never meet again on
earth, and I’m sure he meant what he said,
for if she had been a reptile, he could not
have shuddered more at her touch, as he
shook her off when the poor thing clung to

him, imploring that he would not leave her
thus.”

Lady Sunderland then said: “ To tell you
the truth, Mrs. Davis, it was on Linda’s
account that I came to London, and I have
desired Sinclair to join me here to-night for
the same reason; she left Scotland, and her
friends had no idea why, or where she had
gone. As soon as we heard of it, as the
unfortunate girl has so long been under our
protection, Sinclair and I thought it our
duty, as well as its being our anxious desire,
to endeavour to gain some tidings of her.
Lady Elizabeth is in much distress about this
child of her adoption. I will consult with my
son, and you shall hear from us to-morrow.
Now, you had better return home, for after
what you have told me, I do not think
Linda is in a fit condition to be left alone.
I will order a cab for you.”

On Mrs. Davis’s return, her consterna-

tion may be imagined when Sarah met her
at the door with the information that the
young lady had disappeared. She only
waited to ascertain that this intelligence
was true, to find the letter containing the
brooch, and the few corroborating lines
from Linda, and the same cab which had
brought her from Carlton Gardens con-
veyed her back to the presence of Lady
Sunderland, who now had been joined by
her son, Lord Sinclair. They were at the
very moment talking over this most per-
plexing and distressing business when Mrs.
Davis again appeared before them.

CHAPTER IV.

The night was still thick with fog, as Linda
walked on, little heeding which way she
went. She had no decided plans, although
many floated through her mind. Her pre*
sent almost frenzied desire was to remove
herself somewhere — anywhere — to some
impenetrable distance far from all whom she
had ever seen before. Pursuing the course
of her entangled thoughts and schemes, she
first of all deposited her letter in a post
office, and then looked inquiringly into the
shops of the busy streets in which she by
chance found herself—the gas with which
they were lighted displaying their different
articles for sale.

Suddenly she stopped before one, and
gazed into it thoughtfully. “ Yes,” she
murmured, “ that is what I want; that will
be the best dress for me—the most effectual
disguise.”

She entered the shop, and addressed a
person who was serving behind the counter
—a pale, gentle-looking widow.

“ I want a widow’s cap,” Linda demanded,
“ and a bonnet and veil.”

The woman looked up into the speaker’s
face. A fellow-sufferer—a bereaved one,
like herself, she thought. The face was
concealed by the thick veil.

Several caps were brought forward for
the approbation of the customer.

“ Oh ! ” Linda said, impatiently, “ I
don’t care which I have—anything will
do.”

“ But will you not try them on ?” was
asked.

“No, I have not time; now, a bonnet,
quickly.”

“I have only one quite finished,” the
shopkeeper replied; “ but I fear it will be
too large, and also too old-looking, if it is
for you, madam,” for a glimpse had been
caught through the folds of the veil of a
very young face.

“ Never mind, never mind,” was the im-
patient answer; “ I don’t care how old it
will make me look—the older the better.”

The person who served her, then took
from a bandbox a lugubrious black bonnet
with its long heavy crape fall, which must
effectually have hidden every part of the
face of the wearer save the eyes, the only
part not left in impenetrable darkness by
the double folding of the thick material.

“ That will do, I daresay; and those
things! — I must have some of them, I
suppose,” Linda continued, pointing to

Digitized by LjOOQie
44

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

some collars and cuffs, commonly called
weepers.

“ What am I to pay for all this ?” she
then asked.

“ One pound fifteen,” she was told, when
the bill was added up.

Linda groaned as she drew forth her
purse. How little money would be left!

“ But it cannot be helped,” unconsciously
she said aloud. Then she paused and re-
flected.

“ 1 must put on these things somewhere;
but where can that be ?”

She added, “ Perhaps you will let me go
into that room and change my bonnet,” and
receiving a sanction to this request, she
found herself in the small parlour adjoining
the shop, in which there was a little pale
boy seated at a table writing a copy.

Before she removed the bonnet from her
head, Linda turned suddenly round and said:

Digitized by

A FAST YOUNG LADY.

45

“ What will you allow me for this bonnet
and Honiton lace veil ? I shall never wear
them any more; and,” she added in a gen-
tler, almost a supplicating tone, “ it will be
doing me a special kindness if you would
take them, for I have little money to spare;
and these things, pointing to the mourning,
I must have.” And so saying, she removed
the pretty little fancy straw bonnet from
her head and presented it to the milliner,
who looked with amazement upon the un-
covered face of the young widow, her
woman’s heart melting at the sight; an
anxious feeling for the poor girl mingling
with distrust as to what her real condition
might be, and rendering her for a moment
unable to notice the request. Mrs. Lewis
stood holding the bonnet in her hand, with
her eyes fixed upon Linda, who began
hastily to equip herself in her new head gear.
It was a bonnet evidently intended for an

Digitized by LjOOQie
46

PASSAGES IN THE LITE OE

elderly woman of ample dimensions, far too
large for the small head on which it had
been placed. Linda looked at herself
fixedly in a mirror which hung over the
chimney-piece, and certainly the image it
reflected was a strange anomaly—such a
mixture of the sad and ludicrous.

The slight young figure seemed so out of
character, covered by its enormous summit,
the little white face almost totally lost in
its vast amplitude.

And Linda, whilst she thus beheld her-
self, in spite of her pre-occupied mise-
rable feelings, suddenly felt a sense of the
ridiculous rise in her mind. She turned
away her head for a moment, and in so
doing encountered the eyes of the boy, who
had been curiously watching her move-
ments. He had now a queer sort of smile
upon his lips. The contrast of the girl’s
young face and her hideous head-dress had

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

47

also evidently struck him, for as she turned
her full face upon him he laughed aloud,
thinking no doubt the young lady was only
amusing herself by trying on the ugly
bonnet.

Laughter is very infectious, particularly
to one who was in the nervously excited
state of our heroine.

To Mrs. Lewis’s consternation, she saw
the previously wretched-looking young
widow burst into a convulsive fit of
laughter, which she vainly endeavoured to
control, and which continued to increase.
Peal after peal succeeded, re-echoed by the
boy, until their character changed to tears
and hysterical sobs.

The boy, who had at first joined heartily
in the merriment, now began to look fright-
ened, as his mother told him to be quiet,
and fetch a glass of water. She saw how
it was with the poor girl, and was truly

sorry. Thoroughly exhausted was Linda
when die began to recover.

“ Shall I send for a cab, Ma’am, to take
you home ?” Mrs. Lewis demanded.

“Home! I have no home! I want to
sail for France to-night.”

“ You cannot possibly do that; you are
not fit.”

“ But I must—I must,” and she looked
round for the bonnet.

“ If you can only wait till to-morrow, I
can make you another one, that will suit
you much better,” Mrs. Lewis suggested.

“ I must go. I have no place in London
where I can remain till morning.”

Mrs. Lewis felt some very imprudent
risings at her heart as she looked at the
miserable, tear-stained face of the young
creature before her. She longed to say,
“ I will give you a night’s lodging.”

She had once possessed a daughter; about

Linda’s age she must have been when
she died, and the thoughts of the still
mourning mother reverted to her. But she
hesitated: would it be right? Who and
what might the stranger not be? Cer-
tainly she looked in all ways respectable;
indeed, far above the common class, equip-
ped as she was in a well-made silk dross,
with all else to correspond; her whole
bearing—her voice, her hands, bespeaking
her grade of life; and then the wedding
ring, and its handsome guard of turquoises
—the pretty little watch hanging at her
side — all were unmistakeable tokens in
Mrs. Lewis’s eyes of her being a young
lady. Still there must be something very
wrong to bring her to this pass.

“ Yes, I must go,” Linda gasped, trem-
bling in every limb.

“Mother!” exclaimed the boy, “why
Cannot the young lady stop here to-night ?

She can have my bed, you know, and I can
sleep with you.”

Mrs. Lewis still stood irresolute.

“ Poor girl! what may not become of her
if I turn her out into the streets ? No, I
dare not do so; I should have the sin upon
my conscience as long as I lived. No, it
cannot, must not be.”

“ Yes, Miss; Ma’am, I ought to say, but
you really look so very young; pray let
me, as George suggests, offer you the pro-
tection of my humble dwelling for the
night; it is but homely the accommodation
Lean afford you, but to such as it is you
are heartily welcome.”

Linda lifted up her head, which had sunk
very low, quickly glanced at the kind wo-
man, and in that face read naught but
the purest benevolence.

“ I had better go,” she faltered, turning
till paler; “ why should 1 be a trouble to

A FAST YOUNG LADY.

51

you, I, a perfect stranger?” and she at-
tempted to rise, but the boy now advanced.

“ No, young lady, pray stay with us;
mother wishes it, she always speaks the
truth;” and with gentle force, he made her
sit down again, and poor Linda, her heart
touched and softened by this unlooked-for
kindness, throwing her arms round the
boy’s neck, wept, now gently and silently.

“ Yes, indeed you must stay, my dear,”
Mrs. Lewis added, much affected, “ and
you must have refreshment. I am sure
you look in need of it. Georgie, run for
the corkscrew, the lady must have a glass
of wine immediately,” for she saw how faint
she looked; “ how fortunate that I have
some to give you, a present from my bro-
ther only yesterday; and George, bring up
the cold fowl, and the bread and country
butter. You have come at a fortunate
time, Ma’am, for we had a hamper of good

things from the country at the same time;
my brother is a farmer in a large way.”

And soon Linda was seated at the widow’s
hospitable board, she and her son, with pleas*
ed alacrity, waiting upon her, for miserable
as she was, she was still so unheroine-like as to
be very hungry, only having tasted one cup
of tea during the whole of that agitating day.
Whilst thus engaged, Mrs. Lewis left her in
the charge of George, whilst she went to pre-
pare her sleeping accommodation, and light
a fire in the room to give it a cheerful
appearance; and poor Linda, refreshed and
revived by the genial kindness of her hosts
s and the nourishment she so much required,
could now smile upon her attendant, the
interesting little boy, who gazed at her
with such tender concern.

“ You and your mother are very good,”
at length she said, in a more natural man-
ner, as she held out her hand and drew
him towards her.

“ Mother is always good,” he said.

“ And so are you, I am sure, George;
you are a happy boy to have a mother, and
such a kind one.”

“ Yes, indeed,” was the answer; “ but,”
he added, his eyes filling with tears, “ a
year ago I had a father and a sister, and
since we lost them we have not been very
happy, and we have had other troubles.
You see how ill poor mother looks.”

Mrs. Lewis now appeared, and looked
with pleasure upon Linda’s face, whose ex-
pression had so changed, the fierce look
gone; and though it was flushed, and her
eyes were too bright, still there was more re-
pose altogether in her voice and mien, when
again she poured forth her thanks and
apologies for the trouble she was giving.

Mrs. Lewis thought, “ She is far too
bonny to be all alone in the wide world,”
and then she said,

E 3

“ My accommodation is but small, my
dear young lady.”

“ Oh, anything will do for me,” replied
Linda, “but I wish to start for France
to-morrow night, and I would rather it was
at night that I embark; therefore could
you allow me to remain till then, and to-
morrow, you would perhaps make some
purchases for me ? I have not much money,
but some trinkets of value, which I should
be glad to dispose of.”

And thus Linda, without a shadow of
mistrust, threw herself upon the protection
of a complete stranger. Providential, in-
deed, for her that merciful fate had drawn
her into the humble abode of this excellent
woman!

“ Well, we will talk all about it to-
morrow. I must put you to bed, and when
there, I shall give you one of my composing
draughts: blessings they have been to me,

young lady, I can assure you, when my
sorrow was at its height.”

And Linda saw, as she looked upon that
face, marked with the unmistakeable lines
of grief, that there was one near her who
had indeed suffered deeply.

Georgie having now announced that all
was ready and the fire burning up, Mrs.
Lewis ushered her guest into the sleeping
apartment.

The room was well furnished with a
large, handsome bed, and an air of comfort
and superiority pervaded its aspect, little
to be expected from the general impression
given by the humble little shop down stairs.

A small iron bedstead was the couch pre-
pared for Linda, the sheets white and fine.

“ You won’t mind my little Georgie
sleeping with me, he’s but a baby almost,
and, to tell the truth, I have not been able
to afford to furnish any other room; but we

shall dress in the next, to make this all
tidy for you.”

Linda cared not. She began, indeed, to
feel that, had she attempted any further
exertion that night, she must have sunk
at once. The night-dress was brought
forth from the heavy bag she had dragged
about with her, and then too gladly she
laid herself down on the clean little bed.

Mrs. Lewis set about concocting the com-
posing draught, whose efficacy she so much
vaunted, and almost immediately after it the
good woman had the pleasure of seeing her
guest fall into a quiet sleep. Not till then
did the good woman leave her to spend
part of the night in making a suitable
bonnet for the young widow.

Linda slept all night the sleep of utter
prostration of mind and body.

"When, at length, she opened her eyes,
with a start, she roused herself and looked
wildly, and in bewilderment, around the
room.

We all know how painful is the awakening
from a slumber of complete forgetfulness,
after any crushing misfortune has befallen
us; the temporary oblivion of our senses
scarcely compensating for the agony of re-
newed recollection.

She sat up, and listened to the din of
vehicles passing and repassing that noisy
street.

“ Where am I ?” she cried.

The other bed was empty, its occupants
had long left it; she was alone in her
wretchedness, and soon the whole story of
her misery rushed like an overwhelming
flood into her mind, and piteous was the
tone in which she exclaimed —

“ Unfortunate Linda, what is to become
of you!” and then followed heartrending
sobs and tears.

Poor girl, she thought herself at this
moment friendless, for her unbroken spirit
had not yet made a friend of Him “ who
sticketh closer than any brother.” She had
not yet implored guidance from above,
judgment to know what was right, and
strength to perform it. No; in her weak
folly she had madly plunged upon the
waves of this fearful world, and that mercy
had for the present moment saved her, and
conducted the rash girl to this safe haven,

where, for a brief space, she might breathe in
peace. Linda was not long left alone to weep;
soon she was joined by her kind hostess.

“My dear young lady, what is the
matter?” she exclaimed, on finding her
thus agitated.

“ Oh! Mrs. Lewis, I am so wretched.
Oh, what is to become of me? I am so
very, very miserable.”

And Linda, in her despair, threw her
arms round the kind woman’s neck, feeling
balm and solace whilst weeping forth her
tears upon that compassionate bosom.

Mrs. Lewis allowed the paroxysm to
subside, and then gently extricating herself
from the encircling arms, said,

“ Now, I must light the fire; it is a
bitter morning; and then I shall bring you
some breakfast. You must try, my dear,
to compose yourself; be still, and lift up
your heart in prayer. If you have heavy

sorrows, nothing in the world can assist
you to bear them but bringing all your
troubles to God. I speak, who have felt
how comparatively worthless is every other
sort of help.”

“Pray! Mrs. Lewis — I hardly know
how to pray.”

Mrs. Lewis looked aghast.

“ My dear, what do you mean ? Have you
never been taught to pray ?” she anxiously
demanded.

“Oh, yes—I have, of course, said my
prayers morning and evening, but is that
praying? They never seemed to do me
any good, and since I have been so very
miserable, I have left them off entirely.”

Mrs. Lewis shook her head gravely—
almost sternly; but pity for the poor be-
nighted girl soon changed the harsh feeling
which was beginning to rise in her breast,
and she said,

“ My dear, you need not use long prayers
to make your petitions. You have only to
lift up your heart and cry,(God be merciful
to me a sinner.*”

Linda sprang up from her pillow, her
face flushing crimson, her eyes flashing fire.

“ Mrs. Lewis,” she said, “ what do you
mean? Are you one of those who think
ill of me? How dare you speak those
words ? Iam not a sinner. I will get up
and go; I will not stay a moment longer
with one who misjudges me, who thinks
she is harbouring a sinner;” and indignant
looked the face of the miserable girl.

“ My dear, I did not mean to offend; I
only spoke to you as a fellow-sinner. We
are all sinners; we all have need to cry for
mercy, even those amongst us who appear
the best, the holiest. Gan you be an ex-
cepted one from the curse of sin which has
fallen upon all mankind ? My dear young

lady,” the widow continued, with much
solemnity, “ I fear indeed, until you can,
with humble contrition and true faith,
repeat those words which have given you
such offence, there can be no peace, no help,
no strength vouchsafed to you in your
great trouble, whatever it may be. Yes, I
can truly say that, amidst all my afflictions,
the sorest and bitterest of them all have
been my sins, my mistrust of Him; dwell*
ing, as I have done selfishly, on the weight
of my sorrows, rather than on His justice
and wisdom; murmuring at His will, giving
way to impatience, judging harshly and
cruelly, and feeling hard unforgiveness at
my heart against those who had wronged
me. These are what I call sins, my dear,
with many, many others.”

Linda’s tears were again falling, but
now gently she reached forth her hand, and
took possession of one of Mrs. Lewis’s.

“You a sinner, Mrs. Lewis—you, who
have done such a work of charity by me,
sheltered a friendless unknown girl, taken
her to your kind heart without a fear or
scruple! ”

“ My dear, that is no merit in me, it is
all God’s work in my heart; I only followed
the dictates of his leading. ‘A cup of cold
water given in His name.’”

Linda was again clasping her arms round
the neck of this humble woman, her heart
warming towards her as it never yet had
done towards mortal woman.

“Oh! dear, kind Mrs. Lewis,” she mur-
mured, “teach me to know myself, and to
see my sins; but—-” she continued, throw-
ing herself again helplessly on the pillow,
“ I must go, I must go;” and she flung her
arm over her head in impotent distress.

“Poor child!” the widow interposed,
“do not thus agitate yourself; I shall go

and prepare your breakfast; and whilst I
am gone, repeat those words which gave
you so much offence, over and over again,
and be not dismayed if they bring before
your eyes, hideous forms in the shape of
trangressions innumerable, both of commis-
sion and omission, be not overwhelmed,—
seeing your danger, will ensure your future
safety as well as peace and comfort.”

Mrs. Lewis left her, and Linda lay for
some moments with clasped hands and eyes
raised to heaven; her lips moved, but no
sound issued from them, and thus she re-
mained till her kind hostess brought up a
smaU tray, on which was laid a neat break*
fast, and then Mrs. Lewis proceeded to
make up the fire, and put the room in order.

After she was dressed Linda requested
to be aUowed to remain entirely upstairs
tiU she took her final departure.

“ I would rather not be seen by any one,”

she said; “it must be in the dark that I
must leave you.”

“ Not to-day, my dear,” was the answer,
in this snow storm; and, indeed, you are
not fit to undertake the passage over to
France; you require some rest; besides, did
you not say you wanted several things that
I can get for you ?—There is no hurry for
you to go, if you can put up with what
I am able to offer. I keep no servant,
Georgie and I do all that is required, with
the assistance of a charwoman once a week.”

Linda’s countenance brightened — she
heaved a sigh of relief.

“ A day of peace at least,” she thought.
Her thanks were warm and full of gratitude.
It was, indeed, a desolate road which lay
stretched before her. Her present intention
was to go to Paris, and obtain a livelihood
by teaching music,—if possible, to become
a teacher in some school. But she had no

friends to whom she chose to apply, and
how would she be received, a perfect
stranger, without any references to give ?
But she made no calculations as to the pro-
bable results of her plan—in England, she
would not, could not, stay. But now,
launched upon the sea of uncertainty, the
excitement of the moment passed, she began
to view her situation more dispassionately,
to look with black dismay upon the future.

“But what else can I do but hide myself?”
she thought; “ have I not lost everything,
even the respect of those who once cared
for me ? And he--------! ”

CHAPTER VI.

When Linda was settled comfortably in
the room for the day, a bright fire enliven-
ing the gloom of the dark atmosphere, she
began to make some necessary arrange-
ments for the future.

She opened her trinket box, which really
contained some articles of value—a cross
and a ring of diamonds, and many lesser
ornaments of worth.

She selected the cross, and the next time
Mrs. Lewis appeared, showed it to her, say-
ing,

“ You must sell this for me; I shall want
the money.”

Mrs. Lewis looked much perplexed,

“ My dear young lady, I really do not
know how to act; it is not from idle
curiosity, but I wish you would give me
more of your confidence. I know not even
your name.”

“ My name, my name! ” and the girl
pressed her forehead distractedly with her
hand. “ My name,” she repeated, “ do
you wish to know it?” and again she
paused, as if lost in reflection.

“ It would be pleasanter,” was the an-
swer, in a hesitating tone of voice.

Linda burst into one of those unnatural
peals of laughter which grate so unplea-
santly upon the ear, and then said —

“ You may call me,” and again she
pondered; yes, “ you may call me Mrs.
Lindsey; Rosa Lindsey, will that do?”

“ My dear,” Mrs. Lewis again continued,
interrogatively, “ you are really married,
I suppose ?”

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

69

“ What do you mean ?” cried Linda,
starting up, and fiercely confronting her.
“ What do you take me for ? Not some
rile girl, I hope. If you suspect me in
any way, I had better go at once. Am I
always to be treated as if I was the worst
of sinners?” she cried, indignant tears
now falling quickly down her cheeks. “ I
am lawfully married, so help me God! ”

The good woman felt more than ever
sorry for this poor, desolate, wayward girl.
She kindly took her hand, and drawing her
gently towards her, said—

“ You are very young to be a widow,
poor thing.”

“ I have lost my husband, Mrs. Lewis,”
Linda replied, disconsolately; “ but if you
wish really to befriend me, ask no ques-
tions; only believe me, when I solemnly
assure you that I am no disgrace to
your dwelling. If I were to tell you

all, I feel sure, that instead of blaming me
severely, you would pity more than con-
demn me. I am young—foolish, and you
have already taught me to acknowledge
myself sinful, but I have not acted in such
a manner as would oblige you to spurn me
from your presence and that of your inno-
cent child. Will you believe me ? Will
you trust me, dear, kind woman?”

And Linda, now all gentleness, knelt at
the feet of the thoroughly perplexed and
mystified Mrs. Lewis.

“ My dear, pray don’t do such a thing,”
she exclaimed, as she raised her. “ Yes,
be sure that I will do all I can for you.”

“ But will you believe me—trust me?”
again Linda impetuously demanded.

“ Yes, I will try to do so.”

And then, with a brightened countenance,
Linda kissed and thanked her newly-found
friend.

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

71

“ And now,” she said, “ I must tell you
my plans. I want to go to Paris, and, if
possible, to get into a school, to gain a
livelihood by teaching music.”

“ But have you any friends there who
can recommend you ?”

“ None.”

“ Where do you mean to go, in the first
instance?”

Linda shook kher head, then added, “ I
have no idea.”

“ Oh, this is a mad scheme,” Mrs. Lewis
exclaimed, “ it will never do; why not stop
in England, and try to do what you say?”

“ I tell you I cannot, Mrs. Lewis,” Linda
again petulantly broke forth, stamping with
her small foot, “ I cannot stay in England,
and I have heard there are places in Paris
where one can board and lodge, till I find
something else, and English governesses get
on well abroad, that I know. I once had a

F 4

Digitized by LjOOQie
72

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

French governess, who told me all about it,
so pray say nothing more on the subject.”

Mrs. Lewis groaned in spirit; but she
saw it was useless to argue the point just
now with the impatient girl, so she sat
down and began to cogitate what was best
to be done in this perplexing case.

“ This cross,” she reflected, looking at
that which she held in her hand, “ must
belong to one of some position above the
common grade; it is valuable,” and she
gazed fixedly at the girl. “Yes, she is
indeed above the common rank, I am quite
certain; that one can tell by a glance at her
proud look; my proper course ought to be
to put an advertisement into the papers, to
tell her friends where she is.”

Linda was watching intensely the open,
speaking countenance of the widow, and as
if by some species of clairvoyance she had
read the thoughts which were passing

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

73

through Mrs. Lewis’s mind, she cried,
“ Mrs. Lewis, you are not going to betray
me!” and sprang eagerly towards her.
“ Swear that you will not,” she conti*
nued, her excitement becoming quite fear-
ful to behold, “ or on your head will rest
the consequences. My friends shall never
see me again alive. Where,” and she looked
around, “ are my bonnet and cloak?”

Mrs. Lewis, now fairly terrified by the
wild, determined looks which glared upon
her, promised any thing Linda demanded.
Visions of the Serpentine, the Thames,
strychnine, &c. &c., flashed before her ima-
gination as she looked upon this young
Pythoness. The meek woman felt angry
with herself for the little firmness she could
command, to execute what her conscience
pointed out as the right path to pursue* and
for so completely succumbing to this young
creature, this stranger of only a few hours’

Digitized by LjOOQie
74

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

acquaintance. Now, all she felt inclined to
do, was to soothe and pacify her by any
means in her power. There was something
very interesting in Linda’s appearance. Her
figure was slender, though not yet arrived at
its full perfection; her teeth beautiful. There
was no decided beauty in the tout ensemble
of the small oval face; still there was that
about it which attracts the eye of the
beholder, and causes one to think, “ how
attractive that girl will be ! ”

And the earnest look of either pleasure
or pain, which emanated from her deeply-
fringed eyes, gave an indescribable power
to the expression of the ever-varying coun-
tenance ; sometimes such glances of fierce
indomitable feelings passing over it, the
next moment to be quenched by repentant
tears and heartfelt sorrow.

“ Well, my dear,” Mrs. Lewis said, after
they had talked quietly for some time, “ if

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

you really must dispose of your beautiful
cross, I think I can manage it for you. As
good luck will have it, I have a cousin, a
jeweller in a very good way, and I will
take it to him.”

“ And, Mrs. Lewis,” Linda interposed,
“ I want a great many things—a proper
dress, a warm cloak, and many necessaries.
Oh! all my nice clothes, what a pity I could
not bring any more of them!” she ex-
claimed, and then colouring violently, see-
ing Mrs. Lewis about to speak, she said,
hurriedly—

“ But never mind all that; you know what
I shall want, and you must just get them
at once; and my present cloak and bonnet,
and this pretty Honiton lace veil, sell them,
pray, dear woman. I shall want money until
I begin to earn, and then I expect to be quite
rich. You don’t know how well I can
play; and as to my singing, my Italian

masters used to say there was not a finer
voice in England, and so it ought to be.
Povera madre mia 1 ” she sighed, “ she had
such a beautiful voice.”

Mrs. Lewis groaned in spirit, and thought
how little calculated was that proud heart
to “ earn her bread;” a thing so easily re*
solved upon, so difficult to accomplish — a
task which to perform (setting aside its
other impracticabilities) requires a com*
plete change in our natures, a total ab-
negation of long-rooted habits, opinions,
and general bearing—a humble, submissive
spirit, a total smouldering of every spark
of that excitable pride, ever so ready to
blaze up into a fierce flame at every breath
of humiliation.

The good woman soon went out to exe-
cute her commissions, leaving the shop to
be served by Georgie, who, young as he
was, most cleverly assisted his mother in
every department.

Digitized by LjOoq ie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

77

On her return she found Linda impa-
tiently awaiting her; the hours had passed
very heavily alone, as she had been, for
Georgie was not able to leave the shop for
many minutes together. Mrs. Lewis had
been very successful in all her under-
takings.

Her cousin the jeweller had promised
to give an answer the next day.

“ The cross, he said, was very valuable;
I can tell you, I could not have disposed
of it to any one else: even John Harris
looked astonished, and asked me ever so
many questions. I told him that it was a
customer, a lady who was a widow, and he
could not doubt me, as a stranger might
have done.”

And then she proceeded to show the
material and crape she had bought for the
dress, and a large black mantle, besides
many other articles; and also to tell of the

Digitized by LjOOQie
78

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

good bargain she had made in disposing of
the bonnet, cloak, and veil.

Linda’s spirits now rose; she became
quite gay, enjoyed her tea greatly, which
was brought up by Georgie, and as Mrs.
Lewis remained in the parlour during the
evening, cutting out the widow’s dress,
which she intended to make herself, merry
peals of laughter were heard from the up-
stairs room.

The young lady, seemingly forgetful of
all her trouble, past, present, and to come,
was amusing herself with little Georgie
right well; riddles, puzzles, and tricks
with an old pack of cards Mrs. Lewis had
rummaged out, followed each other in quick
succession, to George’s infinite delight and
wonder.

“ Poor girl! ” soliloquised the widow, as
she listened with astonishment to all this
light-hearted mirth, “ how soon her troubles

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST FOUNG LADY.

79

roll off her heart! She could not have cared
much for her husband, but she is so very
young, it must have been but a short time
that they lived together. Ah, me! it is
not like the rending of soul and body which
it is to lose the husband who has been the
light of one’s countenance for many a year
of happiness, even of sorrow. But it is as
well that the young so speedily throw off
their grief; they have probably a long life
before them; it would not do to carry about
for so lengthened a period hearts weighed
down by sad remembrances; no, it is as
well that they can so soon forget.”

And the widow wiped away the tears
which were now falling from her meek eyes.

“ Well,” she continued to meditate, “ it
is most fortunate for her mother, who she
tells me is dead, that she is gone, for, oh!
what an anxious care such a child would
have been! And this plan of going to Paris,

Digitized by LjOOQie
80

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OP

it makes me tremble to think of it, and so
pretty as she looks at times. Just now,
when I went upstairs to see what all the
noise was about, there she was, with such a
colour in her cheeks, her eyes flashing like
diamonds, showing all her pretty white
teeth, laughing so heartily at some blunders
Georgie had made; no wonder, dear boy,
his little head is quite bewildered by that
queer, taking girl. I believe he thinks her
some fairy—something quite supernatural;
he is ready to worship her. Ah, me! ah,
me! the more I think of it, the more
troubled I feel about that unfortunate young
creature.”

Suddenly a thought darted into her mind:

“ Yes, Madame La Tour, I’ll go to her
to-morrow; she is a decent sort of body; of
course she knows all about Paris, and may
be able to assist us; to tell us at least
where Mrs. Lindsey can safely go, when she

gets to that great wicked city—so full of
snares and pitfalls for such as she is. Mrs.
Lindsey! ” Mrs. Lewis repeated, “ such a
childish thing to be a wife, and yet she
swears she has been lawfully married, and
has lost her husband. Upon my word, this
business is enough to drive one mad, it does
puzzle and perplex one so terribly.”

The preparations went on rapidly. A
dress of the most mournful description was
completed, with a bonnet and veil to cor-
respond, and a box procured, in which Mrs.
Lewis placed everything absolutely neces-
sary for Linda’s immediate comfort.

The jeweller had given a much larger sum
for the cross than she had hoped for, so that,
after having remunerated Mrs. Lewis for
all that she had bought for her, and also
for her board, which, with much difficulty,
Linda insisted upon her taking, a consi-
derable sum remained.

“ You must take care of this for me,
dear woman,” Linda urged. “ It will not
be safe for me to take so much money with
me; I shall lose it, or be robbed. Give me
what you think will be sufficient for the
present, and I can always write to you for
more when I require it, and it will be a
comfort to feel that I have still some tie,
some claim upon you, my kindest friend.”

Mrs. Lewis could not but feel gratified
by this proof of the entire confidence this
strange girl placed in her, and at the same
time concurred in the prudence of the
plan.

CHAPTER VII.

It was with sorrow and shrinking dread,
that Linda saw one by one every excuse
for protracting her stay hourly vanishing.
She had really in her childish heart enjoyed
the time she had spent in that humble
abode, so kindly had she been treated by
the widow and her little son.

The girl’s high spirit had been softened
and subdued by the truly maternal and
tender bearing of her lowly friend. She
had never experienced the love of a mother;
ties of blood relationship had in but a soli-
tary instance exercised their uniting bond
of affection upon her nature. Kindness

G 2

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

and consideration she had received, but not
the peculiar motherly tenderness of a heart
like Mrs. Lewis’s, full as it was with the
very milk of human kindness, and who well
understood by the bitter experience of
sorrow how to feel for the sufferings of
others. The novelty of the position was a
most amusing excitement. To Linda’s
young fancy it was a delightfully romantic
episode, particularly as there was nought
of vulgarity to throw its disenchanting
effect over the homeliness of the daily pro-
ceedings, nor the least straining for an as-
sumption of aught but reality.

Mrs. Lewis possessed the innate refine-
ment of a pure and holy mind, and her boy
promised to be like her, of a very superior
species of the class to which he belonged.

Mrs. Lewis had evidently seen better
days, but there was no low-bred semblance
of superiority in the humble woman who

Google
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

85

performed the menial offices of her changed
life without a murmur, or the slightest ap-
pearance of repugnance; considering no
apology necessary for so doing. And
Linda delighted in assisting—helping to
make the beds and to arrange the rooms;
and even, when the house was shut up for
the night, going into the clean little kitchen
to assist to prepare their small supper, and
to eat it there; no food ever tasted before
so delicious as that which she had lent her
aid to cook; and then the chestnuts she
and George were so fond of roasting before
the fire, it was delightful fun; the fact was,
she was quite as much a child at heart as
George himself, in many ways, although,
poor girl, with all, she possessed also the
far less unmixed feelings of a woman.

And then it was inexhaustible amusement
to peep behind the blind, and watch the
novel scene, the ever busy passing panorama,

o 3

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

always enacting in Oxford Street. Mrs.
Lewis’s shop was at the very extreme end of
that locality, and Linda would smile when
she contrasted her present resting place
with those grand halls and aristocratic
precincts in which her life had been hitherto
passed.

“Oh!” she would ponder, “after all,
people, not places, constitute our well-being.
If this dear woman with her loving ways
had been my mother, I really think I could
have been very happy here, helping her,
working hard for her and my little brother.”

But again other visions crossed her mind
—lighted saloons, splendour, gay company,
faces, forms; and then, with a smothered
groan, she would press her hands upon her
eyes, as if to shut out from her mental
vision, sights which it tortured her to behold.

“ That dear, kind woman, that complete
stranger, has done more for me in these few

A FAST YOUNG LADY.

days than I have gained ever since I was
born. She has taught me so much. Had
I but known and felt before, all that she
has made me feel, poor Linda, you would
not have been as you are now; but what-
ever may henceforth happen, I think I shall
be a different girl in future. I shall carry
away with me a treasure nothing can de-
prive me of—a changed heart, I really hope
I now have; at least she has told me where
to look for everything, and there in future
I must go.”

And Linda threw her arms round the
kind woman’s neck, who at that moment en-
tered the room, and wept upon her bosom.

“ My dear, there’s no hurry; we shall be
very sorry to lose you, that I can say with
truth. I have not been unmindful of your
wishes; and as you insist upon going to
Paris—a plan I cannot like—I have just
been to a person who I think may assist you.”

“ Yes, I must go, Mrs. Lewis,” Linda
hastily replied. “ You have not said any-
thing about me, I hope.”

“ My dear, I never break my promises,”
the widow answered. “ I have been to a
person I used once to know very well. She
is a Frenchwoman, but has lived many
years in England—a milliner in the most
fashionable line. She is, I have every
reason to believe, a very respectable person.
I went to her and said I had a customer, a
young widow lady, who wished to go to
Paris to be a teacher in a school; and asked
if she could in any way assist her by re-
commending a boarding-house where she
might stay in the first instance. I told her
how very young you looked, and that you
were not rich.”

“ And what did she say ?” Linda eagerly
inquired.

“ She said she would consider, and let
me know this evening.”

And that evening a note arrived from
Madame La Tour, saying she was going to
send her forewoman to Paris on Monday to
execute some business, and if the lady was
ready to start, she could travel with her.
Madame La Tour added that she would
write to her correspondent, another cele-
brated modiste, who would, she was sure,
assist to find the lady an abode.

This was an opportunity not to be lost,
and the offer was accepted. It was already
Saturday; how short the time now ap-
peared to the period when Linda must leave
her friends! We are very much inclined
to measure time by circumstances more
than by its real duration—by those leaden
hours that sometimes pass so laggingly,
and then again the changed feeling which
renders every minute valuable as a thread
of gold.

The girl clung with the affection of years,

instead of days, to those who had so pitied
her in such an hour of need. Adversity
draws hearts together in a far more rapid
and closer manner than years of pros*
perous intercourse; and the terrifying idea
that she was so soon to go forth alone, to
drift down the troublous stream of life,
with no one friendly hand held out to assist
her, seemed every moment more and more
alarming. She became nervous and fright-
ened ; many were the tears shed that night
as she contemplated the awful prospect
before her.

“ Shall I,” she once that night exclaimed,
starting up in bed, “shall I tell her all,
and ask her to advise me what to do ? But
no, I cannot. I know what she would say,
—that it was my bounden duty to write to
them, and explain it all. Oh, no! I cannot
—I cannot. Rather let me be buffeted
about the world, exposed to every trouble

and hardship. And do I not deserve it all
for my former folly—my vanity ? Yes,
dear Mrs. Lewis; and here I can acknow-
ledge it—my sin—for is not vanity sin?
And I thought—I thought he loved me.
I—such a foolish, senseless girl!” And
she hid her face in the bed-clothes, to sup-
press the sound of her sobs, fearing they
might disturb her sleeping companions.

But with the morning’s sunshine the
dark clouds of her mind had in a measure
departed. Oh, those happy careless days
of early youth, when troubles roll ofF so
speedily from the smooth surface of the
heart, leaving so few traces behind ! so dif-
ferent from one which has been long
worn and furrowed by the constant drop-
pings of cares and sorrows — the griefs of
the aged, with whom life at best is but a
“ wintry day,” and which can look in this
world for no after-growth of happiness.

But the young—their elastic spirits soon
rise above the pressure of grief, close
above the wound. Linda had so much to
do, helping to pack, and to finish some of
her lugubrious possessions, that she seemed
for a while to forget her woes, and that
evening again Mrs. Lewis’s ears caught the
sound of the melodious laugh issuing from
the bedroom, where Linda and the boy
were pursuing their favourite amusement
of roasting chestnuts; and as she entered to
tell them not to make quite so much noise,
as many customers were coming in and out,
and one lady had already said, “ You seem
to have a merry party upstairs, Mrs.
Lewis,” she saw the sorrowing widow with
her arms flung over her head, and her
mouth opened to its fullest extent, giving
way to unrestrained merriment, elicited by
some quaint remark of the innocent George,
which had tickled her fancv.

“Oh, Mrs. Lewis,” she said, when she
could command her voice, “ that boy will
be the death of me. He has been asking
such ridiculous questions.”

“ I only asked Mrs. Lindsey if she had any
children,” the boy deprecatingly explained.
“ There is nothing so extraordinary in that,
is there, mother ?” But Linda seemed to
think there was, and went on laughing
till Mrs. Lewis thought it best to put a
stop to what generally ended in a painful
reaction of feeling. She made some grave
remark that immediately turned poor
Linda’s thoughts to the fast approaching
Monday, and her mood soon changed from
gaiety to dejection.

That evening, when George had cried
himself to sleep, for he was heart-broken at
the idea of losing his dear Mrs. Lindsey,
Linda, seated on a footstool, with her
head on Mrs. Lewis’s knee, was talking

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

long and sadly, and listening to words from
her humble friend which sank indelibly into
her heart.

“Yes; you will see, dear Mrs. Lewis,
that all my life I shall be a better girl.
You have taught me what I never knew
before; and ever since I was born I have
been so wilful, so foolish, and ungrateful.
It seems as if my heart had never been able
to lean to any one as it has done towards
you; yet I have received great kindness
from many; and oh, it shocks me now
to think how ungrateful I have been,

and must now appear. And yet--------------”

And now the despondent, humble look
suddenly disappeared; it changed to one of
fierceness, as she continued: “ Mrs. Lewis!
still, though I may have been everything
that is unamiable and foolish, I have been
wickedly treated. Yes, most wickedly.”
And the girl now clenched her hands, and

A FAST YOUNG LADY.

set her teeth, whilst glances of scorn, nay,
even hatred, flashed from her eyes.

“ Oh, Mrs. Lewis, when I think of some
things, I feel such rage and hatred rising in
my heart, that I could play the part of a
demon; so do not raise the dreadful
spirits before me by asking any ques-
tions. Let me endeavour, if possible,
to forget the past, and only look onwards
—-never casting a thought back upon what
has been.”

“ But, dear, one thing I must say, and I
entreat you to turn it, with many others
that we have talked over, in your mind
when you have left me. Remember, it is
our bounden duty to forgive.”

“ Forgive!” was the impetuous rejoinder;
and the wrathful look which shot from those
young eyes shocked and saddened the good
woman.

“Poor child!” she thought; “all this

tells of a heart which requires much chas-
tening to subdue its pride.”

Mrs. Lewis was much more communi-
cative to her young friend. She told her
without reserve the story of her life—one
of no eventful interest until the very few
last years, when sorrow had ruffled its calm,
happy, uneventful surface.

Her husband had been in a most thriving
business, but before his death was a ruined,
heart-broken man. The old story had been
the cause of this disaster. . He had weakly
taken upon himself the responsibility of a
friend’s liabilities—one whom he had trusted
as a brother, and utter destruction was the
consequence.

They had lived in a pretty house, sur-
rounded by a garden, within a mile or two
of London, their two children growing up in
health and happiness—all this was utterly
swept away. The father, a most excellent

man, his only fault his being too yielding in
his nature, perhaps less strong-minded than
his enduring wife, never recovered the shock
of the utter beggary in which he had in-
volved his wife and children—a brain fever
speedily brought him to the grave. In
the state of destitution into which the family
were plunged, Lucy, the daughter, then
nearly eighteen years old, endeavoured to
relieve her mother of the burden of her
maintenance, by gaining her own livelihood.
She entered a family as attendant upon
some little girls, performing also the duties
of nursery governess to them.

But, alas! the widow’s cup of grief was
not yet half filled. The scarlet fever was
raging in the neighbourhood, and in the
house where Lucy resided it soon made its
spectral appearance, and she became one of
its first victims.

the complaint, I had hastened to see my
child, and by that means conveyed the in-
fection to George.” Mrs. Lewis continued,
when she had controlled her emotion suffi-
ciently to speak, “Both my children were
soon at the point of death; but one was
mercifully spared to me, although George
has never been the same in health since
that fearful disease; but, thank God that he
has been left, although my Lucy God thought
in his wisdom to remove from her poor
doting mother.”

“Oh! Mrs. Lewis, dear, dear Mrs.
Lewis,” cried Linda, now weeping bitterly,
“and you have gone through all this trouble,
and can speak of it thus calmly ? ”

“ My dear, how can I do otherwise, when
it was God’s will that I should have thus suf-
fered? At first my hard heart rebelled,
and had it not been for my boy, despair
might well nigh have destroyed me, for my

Lucy had ever been my best beloved, my
pride and joy; too much so, no doubt, for
now I can see that I made her an idol.
“ However,” the mother continued, “ I had
a work to do. George lingered on, and
there was only me to nurse him; so strength
was vouchsafed, and sweet comfort has since
been sent to my tom heart in that dear
child.”

“ Well, to shorten my sad story, I will
just add that my friends were all most
kind. Even our creditors, for the most
part, respected and were sorry for my dear
husband; and there were not a few amongst
them who came forward in the most con-
siderate manner, returning many things
necessary to our immediate comfort, which
my husband, as a bankrupt, had most
scrupulously given up.

“ My own relations too were nobly gene-
rous, and by their kindness I have been esta-

have carried on this little business with
tolerable success. And now, my dear, I
have told you all; don’t grieve for me,” the
widow added, as Linda clung to her, sob-
bing ; “for in the midst of all this misery I
have found comfort and cause for much
thankfulness,”

The girl’s really affectionate heart was
deeply touched. No lesson could have been
so effectual in its teaching as this tale of
real woe—no payment so precious to the
excellent woman as the words Linda at
length faltered forth,—

“ Mrs. Lewis, I thank you for telling me
all this; I shall never forget it. Oh, how
ashamed I feel of my paltry trials, after
hearing of your sorrows; but it will be
good for me, dear woman! Yes, very
good for me. ■ I hope what I have heard
will teach me also patience, submission;

and now I know that there is, as you say,
but one refuge in trouble, and that must
indeed be a sure one, or how could you so
cheerfully have borne such a load of grief?
Yes, dear Mrs. Lewis, I will think of yottr
meek face in my hours of bitterness, and
my impatient heart will grow calm.”

“Not of me, my child,” the widow
earnestly exclaimed, “not of me, but of
Him who is the Father of the fatherless
and of the widow.”

“ Yes, I will; I promise you I will,” re-
peated Linda, sinking upon her knees, and
hiding her face on the widow’s lap; “ and,”
she added, “ I hope we may live to meet
again, that you may see that I have fol-
lowed your precepts. Oh, Mrs. Lewis, if
I could only have you always with me, and
be to you a daughter in the room of poor
Lucy. Alas! alas! this cannot be here in
England.”

It was now late, and Mrs. Lewis was
obliged to hurry her guest to bed; but long
after she was asleep the widow still watched.
With what a heart-ache she looked upon
that childish face, so brightly flushed from
the agitation of the past hours!

“ What a sweet face it is! ” she sighed,
“ really scarcely looking older than Georgie,
lying there, with only that small head and
face appearing. What it can all be, this
mysterious history of hers I have no
idea—something very wrong somewhere, I
fear; but I can’t think evil of the poor
child—wilful, headstrong, and imprudent,
no doubt she has been, but not wicked.
Well, it cannot be helped, whatever it is;
I must go through with it now. I may
have been unwise, imprudent, but after all
I have only done my duty as a Christian
woman; and I feel sure, come what may,
I shall never repent of it—indeed I would

do more if 1 could for her, poor young
creature! and my heart, which is so dreary,
will miss that face most painfully. And,
oh, dear me, to think of the like of her
alone upon the wide world!” Mrs. Lewis
was miserable at this idea, and die would
have made any sacrifice to have further be-
friended the desolate Linda, but could do
no more than pray most fervently for her
welfare.

Very little sleep visited the widow’s eyes
that night, and it was with a load at her
heart that she commenced the business of
another day.

The frost and snow had departed, and
were succeeded by a damp, heavy atmo-
sphere. Linda was not to start till night,
and it was arranged that she should meet
Madame La Tour’s forewoman at the place
of departure. Mrs. Lewis and George were
to accompany her to see the last of their

H 4

Digitized by LjOOQie
104 PASSAGES IN THE LITE OF

young friend, and in order that the former
might place her under the protection of the
Frenchwoman, Mamselle Sophie.

It was only a very short time before they
departed that Mrs. Lewis could prevail
upon Linda to change her dress and put
on her sombre suit of weeds.

A singular effect they certainly produced
upon the appearance of this childish-
looking creature, and tears were in the
kind woman’s eyes as she looked at her
when thoroughly equipped. But there was
no answering emotion in those of the young
widow—rather an indignant flush—and a
scornful look her eyes emitted.

“ You would not know me for the same
person ?” she then rather anxiously de-
manded.

“ Scarcely, indeed! ” was the answer, and
then Mrs. Lewis went on earnestly to re-
commend that she would take care of her

new dress, and put on the dressing-gown
she would find in the carpet-bag before she
lay down in the berth. “ Pray remember
the new crape,” was one of her careful
admonitions, “and be sure that you hang
up your bonnet.”

Poor Linda was now very miserable and
nervous, and Georgie overwhelmed with
grief. The boy loved the young lady so
dearly, her stay with them had been such
happiness, that the idea of losing her was
quite dreadful.

“ Indeed, dear Georgie, you must write to
me, and you must always tell me how your
dear mother looks, and how she is; never
mind spelling or grammar; all I shall care
about is to hear from you. Oh, Georgie,
what a happy boy you are, always to be with
such a mother! ”

Georgie hung about her as she sat list-
lessly allowing Mrs. Lewis to perform every

part of the packing and preparations for
her departure; and at length, with a very
heavy heart, on the darkest and gloomiest
of November nights, Linda quitted the
humble refuge which had proved a haven
of peace to her.

CHAPTER VIII.

The parting was over, and a sad one it
was. All who have ever embarked on
board a steamer from the London Wharf,
can enter into Linda’s bewilderment, which
almost absorbed every other feeling, whilst
being jostled by thewatermen, all struggling
for her luggage, preparatory to stepping
into the boat which was to convey her and
her companion to the vessel.

Dark looked the river, lights gleaming on
its troubled waters from the numerous
buildings around; the cold wind blowing
on the girl’s face, rain dropping upon her
head.

She had not till now in any way realised

Digitized by LjOOQie
108 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

her position, and as, with a start of dis-
may, she found herself at length on board
the packet, a feeling of blank desolation
rushed to her heart. Her first impotent
impulse was to spring forward with a wild
resolve to return to the widow and her son,
who, she felt sure, were still watching the
departure of the vessel.

“ But oh, it is too late! ” she exclaimed.

The ship was indeed already in motion,
and she had no alternative but to wring
her hands and sob in hopeless distress,
as her eyes fixed themselves in the direc-
tion where she fancied might still be stand-
ing the only two on earth who, in her
present morbid state of mind, she imagined
felt any interest in her.

The Frenchwoman now approached and
spoke soothingly to her, but little did Linda
heed her words, or the proposal that she
should accompany her into the saloon.

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

109

“ Madame,” the milliner said in French,
“ will be wet through; we had better go
down and secure our berths, for we shall
have a terrible night.”

And Linda passively allowed herself to
be conducted to the saloon, and once there
she threw herself helplessly on a seat,
leaving Mamselle Sophie to make what
arrangements she pleased about her sleep-
ing accommodation.

Tt had been settled that Linda was to
accompany Madame La Tour’s forewoman,
in the first instance, to her friend and busi-
ness correspondent, a first-rate milliner,
Madame Le Roi, whose Magasin de Modes
was situated in one of the most distinguished
localities of Paris. She had been deputed
to find some establishment of respectability,
in which the young lady could reside until
she had definitively arranged her plans.

As there she sat, all the excitement of the

Digitized by LjOOQie
110 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

last week subsiding into terror, as she felt,
for the first time, the reality of her lonely
position, the poor girl was indeed a pitiable
object; all her past existence, her impetu-
ous, self-willed conduct rising up in judg-
ment to condemn her, filling her heart with
affright and repentant sorrow.

“ What will become of me?” she almost
suddenly exclaimed.

In her total absorption, her despairing
feelings, she had thrown her veil back, and
sat with her hands clasped, her eyes, from
which tears fell fast, raised piteously, as if
invoking help from above. But we fear
the attitude was more indicative of devotion
than her thoughts really were at that mo-
ment.

She cared not who saw her, in the im-
patience of her present feelings, or what
might be the consequences. She was for-
getful of Mrs. Lewis’s words of counsel, of

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

Ill

all her own promises of seeking aid from
whence alone it could be derived. Again,
she was the miserable girl sorrowing im-
potently without hope.

The saloon was full of people, but she
saw them not; little heeded that many
looked upon her with surprise, some with
compassion; her widow’s weeds, so strange
a contrast to that small childish face, her
deep distress!—it was so unusual, and
doubly affecting to witness in one so young.

As the night advanced the sea rough-
ened, large waves beat against the vessel’s
sides, and soon the assembled party began
to disperse; one by one might be seen a
fresh victim reeling helplessly, supported by
the steward or stewardess into the sleeping
cabin, a prey to that demon of sickness,
whose power is resistless; but Linda felt it
not; perhaps the counter-irritation of her
mind saved her from bodily suffering. The

Digitized by LjOOQie
112 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

motion of the packet, however, became
every moment more violent. She could
with difficulty keep her seat, but still re-
sisted the repeated advice of the stewardess
that she should take possession of her
berth. She dreaded the lights, the sounds,
and the atmosphere of the sleeping cabin,
crowded as it must be with so many suf-
ferers. Through the gloom of the saloon,
lighted so dimly by the lamp swaying to
and fro, she had scarcely perceived that
she was not alone, but that a pair of eyes
were attentively watching her with the
deepest interest. She had removed her
heavy bonnet, so that the face was no
longer hidden, and the young man who
looked upon it, felt such pity for the poor
young sorrowing one, whose eyes were so
red with weeping, and with such a piteous
expression on her countenance, that gladly
would he have done any thing possible to
serve her.

He longed to say something, to offer his
services, for he had a good, kind, English
heart Anyone in distress commanded his
sympathy; but in one so very young he
could not bear to see it; and he ventured by
degrees to approach nearer to where she
sat, and then made some casual remark
upon the stormy state of the weather.

Linda started; what Was she to do ?—
and she had taken off her bonnet.

“ However,” despairingly she thought,
“ I care not what becomes of me.”

She just answered at first in mono-
syllables, but the gentleman persisted, and
very soon she felt a degree of inexpressible
comfort whilst listening to his soothing
tone of voice.

There is certainly a magic influence in
the sound of a voice; so much does it at
once convey an impression of the identity,
the character, the station of the speaker.

No wonder, then, that the blind so gener-
ally read aright characteristics by the mere
intonation of those with whom they con-
verse; every inflexion of their voices proving
as sure an index to their darkened vision,
as the fluctuations of the countenance af-
ford to those who are able to watch its
variations.

Linda felt imperceptibly re-assured; a
creature of impulse,—one moment in the
depths of despair, the next, her spirits re-
bounding in a surprising manner, forgetting
for a while aught but the impression of
|he actual present—she was soon chatting
freely to this perfect stranger.

Nothing conducts an acquaintance so
speedily to a climax as the saloon of a
packet in a tremendous sea, particularly if
we are not quite laid low by sickness;
there are so many little events and contre-
temps which bring one in familiar contact,

A FAST YOUKG LADY.

destroying at once all attempts at formality
or ceremony.

Soon the heaving and lurching of the
vessel rendered Linda’s position critical;
she was obliged to accept the gentleman’s
arm to save her from falling from the
insecure situation in which she was placed;
but once in comparative security she laughed
merrily, and seemed rather to enjoy what
once she would have termed the fun of the
whole business.

How strangely did the laugh sound to
the young man, who had so few minutes
before watched such despairing anguish in
the face of the infantine-looking widow 1
But this only made him pity her the more.

In the interval of the temporary compara-
tive quiet they talked together, and Linda
was soon telling him that she had always
been an excellent sailor, and Was well ac-
customed to the sea; had yachted a great

deal from Torquay, had been out in very
rough weather, and had never yet suffered
from sea-sickness.

The next question was, where she had
been, and Linda told of Cherbourg, the
Channel Islands, Scotland, &c., &c., and
she was asked what was the name of the
yacht ?

Then a dead silence ensued—the charm
was broken. Linda shrank back, and spoke
not afterwards; and the stewardess appear-
ing, and again advising her most strongly
to go to her berth, saying that the storm
was increasing, and soon she would not be
able to remain where she was in safety,
she at length consented to go to the ladies’
cabin.

With the utmost difficulty, assisted by
the stewardess, she at length, remembering
Mrs. Lewis’s orders, contrived to take off
her dress and put on a dressing-gown, and

at last found herself in a berth, repenting
most sorely that she had left the saloon;
for the state of the passengers assembled
there, was anything but agreeable to the
senses; every one suffering more or less
from the tortures of that most incurable of
horrors, the almost certain accompaniment
to a stormy passage across the channel.

The lady in the next berth to Linda’s
seemed to be in a worse plight than all the
others.

The stewardess, tom to pieces by the
necessities of the various passengers, was
unable to give her the attention she so evi-
dently required, and her exclamations and
cries for assistance were piteous in the ex-
treme.

“ Oh, why did I attempt this horrid
long passage?” she would exclaim. “I
must die—I cannot survive this torture!

i 3

Digitized by LjOOQie
118 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

Stewardess, for mercy’s sake come to me,
or I must expire.”

But the stewardess could not move; she
was at that moment held tight in the grasp
of another sufferer, who would not allow
her to leave her side.

Linda really began to be alarmed, as well
as very sorry for the poor woman. She sat
up in her berth and said —

“ Can 1 do anything for you, ma’am ? ”

“Oh, I am dying! I am dying!” was
the only answer, “and no one will come
near me.”

Linda, with the utmost difficulty, con-
trived to get out of the berth. Holding
tight by the side, with one hand she con-
trived to support herself, whilst with the

So kindly and effectually, that soon, with
the selfishness of suffering, she became
so necessary that, whenever the weary girl
endeavoured to return to her berth, she
was implored so earnestly to remain that
she had not the heart to refuse. But
at length it occurred to Linda that she
had heard of a specific which, after sea-sick*’
ness had done its worst, produced a won*
derful effect in procuring rest.

She called the stewardess,* and desired
her to bring a large glass of mulled port
wine, well spiced.

After some demur, and promises of good
payment, this was obtained, and Linda,
with some difficulty, insisted upon her
patient swallowing almost a tumblerful of
this cordial. The lady had been well nigh
exhausted by so many hours of incessant
sickness, therefore the potent nature of the
draught, to Linda’s relief, speedily took

effect—her charge soon fell into a profound
slumber; and the storm having in a great
measure subsided, the motion of the packet
was now comparatively easy. Linda gladly
crept into her berth, and in a moment
was also fast asleep, and so remained for
two hours, when she awoke, finding that
they had reached Boulogne, and that the
wretched inmates of the berths had been
aroused from -the short oblivion they might
have enjoyed of their night of misery.

She started up, longing to get out of this
chamber of horrors; and demanding of the
stewardess where she could find washing
materials, was soon endeavouring to re-
fresh herself by as much ablution as the
scanty means of a packet would afford.

She had peeped into her patient’s berth,
and was glad to see her still asleep, and felt
rather proud of her successful doctoring,
which had proved so effectual.

But the lady’s eyes were only closed.
She had been awake some time, still feeling
the exhausting effects of her dreadful night,
and thinking, with much gratitude, of the
kind girl who had done so much for her
alleviation. No one was as yet astir but
Linda; and the lady, turning on her side,
looked forth, and first saw her kind young
nurse devoutly kneel down, and leaning her
face upon her hands, perform her morning
devotions. Then she watched her through
the different stages of her toilette,—how at
length she combed out and coiled her long
hair round the back of her small head, and
then—no, it could not be possible,—and
the lady raised herself upon her elbow to
gain a better view, as she saw this child-
like-looking creature place upon that little
head a widow’s cap, and proceed to equip
herself in the complete garb of a bereaved
wife.

Linda was on the point of leaving the
cabin, panting to breathe the fresh air on
deck, when, chancing to look round her,
she saw the lady, with her eyes open,
fixed upon her. She immediately went
up to the berth, inquiring kindly how she
felt.

Then followed the most lady-like expres-
sions of gratitude for the services she had
rendered. A very different individual was
the calm, collected, dignified person who now
addressed her, to the abject, petulant woman
who, so short a time ago, would have sold
her birthright for a moment’s reprieve from
the sufferings under which she groaned;
from the degrading, levelling effect of sea-
sickness, that respecter of no one person,
high or low, rich or poor, equally regard-
less of the queen as of the subject—which
laughs to scorn every nostrum human skill
has ever devised, bringing the victims of

its despotic sway powerless under its
complete dominion. Yes, there is cer-
tainly one thing omnipotent even here
below.

Linda flew up the companion stairs upon
deck. How delicious was the open air after
the night spent in that dreadful cabin below!
She leant over the side of the vessel, gazing
upon the town of Boulogne; but her
thoughts were wandering far and wide, the
moment’s pleasurable sensation soon giving
place to the anxious cares which pressed
upon her heart.

She was roused from her reverie by a
voice behind her, saying—

“I am glad to see that you have reco-
vered the horrors of the night you so much
dreaded.”

It was her acquaintance of the previous
evening, and Linda felt glad again to behold

Digitized by LjOOQie
124 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

that agreeable countenance, a passport to
her favour quite irresistible.

They chatted freely until summoned to
breakfast. When seated at the well-filled
table, she hurriedly cast her eyes over the
assembled party; but seemingly satisfied
with the scrutiny, she raised her veil and
commenced the meal, to which she was
assiduously assisted by her new acquain-
tance. She observed, however, that the
lady who sat opposite gazed fixedly upon
her.

Could it be possible ? Was that imposing-
looking person, so strong-minded in the ex-
pression of her countenance, the impatient,
fractious, impotent invalid, giving way to
every ejaculation of complaint, whom she
had nursed during the night?

She was a tall, stately personage, between
forty and fifty—a cold, rather stern ex-
pression the chief characteristic of her

countenance, her eyes hawk-like, so keen
and piercing they appeared; but when she
smiled, a look of benevolence seemed, like
a sunbeam on a winter’s day, to lighten its
frigidity.

The lady evidently was much interested
by the appearance of the youthful widow,
and Linda caught her eyes repeatedly, as
she sat before her, apparently endeavouring
to penetrate into her inmost thoughts.

Breakfast was soon over, and the con-
fusion of landing commenced. Again
Linda’s spirits, which had with their usual
elasticity risen for a space, sank again.
Her resting time was passed—the future,
with all its difficulties, was again staring
her in the face, and the ready tears began
to gather in her eyes.

The Frenchwoman began to bustle
about, advising her to make her prepara-
tions; and it was with a listless, miserable

Digitized by LjOOQie
126 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

air that Linda followed her into the sleep*
ing cabin to look after her carpet*bag.

“ Are you going to Paris, Madam ?” was
asked in a clear, decided voice by the lady
whom she encountered, also on the same
errand; “ for if so, perhaps I may have the
pleasure of travelling with you in the same
carriage ?”

Linda eagerly expressed her acquies*
cence, and felt a sensation of relief in feel-
ing that, during the journey at least, she
would be under the protection of one who
appeared so unmistakably respectable.

Prom that moment she kept close to her
new acquaintance, evidently evincing such
comfort in the proximity—even viewing
with indifference the offered services of the
handsome young man—that the lady, whose
perception was acute to a degree, at once
perceived it, and felt not only gratified, but
formed at once a favourable estimate of

Linda, who, now that she had found a sup-
port in one of her own class and sex, seemed
to regard with perfect indifference the at-
tentions of the young man who hovered
about her, perceptibly much attracted by
the interesting young widow. He was at
the carriage window making his adieux
when they departed, and might have been
seen standing on the platform watching the
train as long as it was visible; and then
with a sigh walking away, thinking, “ Poor
girl, I wonder who she is ? What can be
her history ? I wish I had not met her;
that piteous face of hers last night will
trouble me for many a day! ”

And so it sometimes happens during our
journey through life: we are struck by an
expression in a face, by some peculiar
fascination in the bearing of a stranger
casually seen, and perhaps never again en-

“ My dear, kind Friend,

“I have only time to write most hur-
riedly; but you will, I know, be glad to
hear that the poor girl whom you have so
compassionately assisted in her hour of need
is for the present in safe, keeping.”

Then followed the account of the passage
to Boulogne,. and the manner in which
her acquaintance commenced with the lady
whose guest Linda now was.

“ During our journey to Paris my com-
panion questioned me as to my arrange-

I told her what they were; that I expected
Madame le Roi would have secured some
present asylum for me until I had attained
the object which had induced me to leave
England; and I informed her of my earnest
desire to obtain a situation in a school,
where I might make myself useful in
teaching music. Mrs. Grandison, for that
is her name, was silent for some time after
I had spoken, and then she said, ( You, of
course, are supplied with credentials to
assist you in this object?’

‘“No, indeed, I don’t possess a single
reference. Are they really necessary?’ I
added, in blank dismay.

“ ‘ Absolutely,’ was the lacqpic reply.

“ ‘ Then,’ I exclaimed, losing all presence
of mind, ‘I am indeed an unfortunate
creature, and what is to become of me
God only knows! ’ and I covered my face

and. cried bitterly. Mrs. Grandison waa
silent; when she spoke again it was in a
firm though not unkind tone of voice.

‘“You could not expect, young lady,
that any right-thinking person would re-
ceive into their house a stranger, without a
friend to vouch for her respectability; it
would be, indeed, the height of imprudence,
particularly when that stranger must neces-
sarily associate intimately with the young
people committed to her charge. For in-

some pupils,—at this very moment I am
in want of a resident teacher of music,

“ I interrupted her by exclaiming, dread-
fully excited, ‘Oh, madam, dear madam,

girl, but there is nothing really wrong or

or look upon me as they have done. I again
implore you to try me; I do not want you
to pay me until you have proved me
thoroughly; let me work for you without
any salary for three months, then, if you
find me worthy, give me a pittance, just
sufficient to buy what is necessary for this
dress, which will henceforth be my constant
livery,’ and I pointed to my widow’s garb.

“Mrs. Grandison still shook her head
doubtingly. I was sitting on the seat op-
posite to her, my eyes fixed with the inten-
sity of hope and fear upon her severe
countenance. How earnestly I begged and
prayed, implored her in the name of mercy
to have pity upon me, no pen can describe!

‘“At any rate,’after some hesitation, she
said, evidently softened by my tears and
vehement importunities, ‘ I shall be glad if
you will go home with me now, and stay a

week, and in that time something may be
done for you.’

“ You may imagine my rapturous grati-
tude. Mrs. Grandison looked amazed at
my impetuous conduct, she, so calm and
cold! though, as I flung my arms round her
neck, and with sobs and tears kissed her
over and over again, blessing and thanking
her for her goodness, I thought I saw her
eyes fill with tears, and certainly her voice
sounded much more gentle when she bid me
compose myself. Oh! Mrs. Lewis, have not
goodness and mercy followed my footsteps
ever since I have needed them so greatly?’

.	“ ‘ But your maid,’ she said, ‘ I fear I

cannot consent to receive her also.’

“ I soon explained to her who Mam’selle
Sophie was; and just then we were about
to enter Paris, and all was again confusion.
I told the Frenchwoman, who had travelled
in a second-class carriage, my change of

plans; and, according to Mrs. Grandison’s
directions, gave her my address; and after
everything was arranged, and our luggage
left to the charge of a respectable-looking
man-servant, whom we found at the station,
we entered a fiacre and drove to Mrs. Gran-
dison’s abode.

“ The house stood within gates, at which
there was a lodge for the concierge or porter.
It seemed large and gloomy as we entered
at that dusky time of the day, before the
lamps were lighted; but the room into which
we were ushered was bright with the ra-
diance of a large wood fire.

“ ‘ Wait here and warm yourself, whilst.
I go and make preparations about your
sleeping apartment,’ Mrs. Grandison said;
‘ but, by the by, what is your name ? I
must know that at least.’

“ I told her it was Mrs. Lindsay, and she
departed.

“ And then, dear Mrs. Lewis, I thought of
you, and on my knees I thanked God fot
this present deliverance, and implored His
assistance to help me on in the course into
which my fate had drawn me; and as I
rose on Mrs. Grandison’s entrance, I felt
so strengthened, such a feeling of relief
and happiness filling my heart, that I again
rushed into the arms of that tall, stately-
looking woman — I daresay she thought
with childish, foolish vehemence—thanking
her for her kindness.

“ ‘ Now I will take you to your apart-
ment,’ she said, when she could extricate
herself from my embraces; ‘you will find
it quite prepared, for I had expected to
have brought back a young lady, and the
room you will occupy was made ready for
her reception.’

“ I followed her upstairs, and through
a long passage, until we arrived at a door,

and entered a large room, which, but
for the bed in a recess, did not look
like a sleeping apartment. It appeared
to me more resembling a study, the large
library table being covered with books and
writing materials, while leading out of it
were two smaller chambers, one which was
appropriated by Mrs. Grandison to the
business of the toilette, the other fitted
up as a sleeping room, on a very small
scale, with its French bed and furniture
to match.

“ ‘ This little room,’ Mrs. Grandison re*
marked, ‘I keep in general for a new pupil;
I think it more agreeable for a stranger,
before she becomes acquainted with her
companions, to be alone. ’ Will you like
Weston to assist you in opening your trunk?
Dinner will be ready in an hour.’

“ I thanked her, but declined the offer;
my carpet-bag contained all that I required

for the present, and in it, you, dear woman,
had deposited in the little carton, my cap.
I smoothed my hair and put it on, took out
the contents of the bag, and when these
little arrangements were over, had still
time to look around at my tiny domicile
and write these hurried lines to you. Such
a pretty little room it is, furnished as only
French taste can furnish; and then I looked
out of the window, and saw that a large
garden belonged to the house. ‘ Oh! that
I may be allowed to stay here! ’ I thought;
‘ it is just the place to suit me, I am sure;
and Mrs. Grandison, though she does look
so severe, and is so stately, what a lady-
like woman she is! and under all that cold
exterior I am sure she has a warm heart,—
I know I could serve her well.’ Oh, Mrs.

thoughts of the past rush through my
mind!—my wilfulness towards those who

have been so good to me ever since I was
born, and who must now think me a
regular monster of ingratitude, must feel
that so much kindness and affection, so
freely bestowed, have been utterly thrown
away. The feelings of my heart must have
been in a state of total apathy, for from
what I now experience, they must have
been always there; but bound fast by pride
and folly, never did I realize their natural
workings until suddenly they seemed to
burst forth when I was with you, dear,
dear Mrs. Lewis! Those words you bid
me utter, ‘ God be merciful to me a sinner,’
and which, after a hard struggle with my
rebellious nature, I have been able to re-
peat with sincerity, seemed to break open
the fast-closed gates of my cold, hard heart,
and oh, what a flood of torturing thoughts
did then enter into my benighted soul!

how kind they were, the friends of my

coldness, disrespect; no answering love.

CHAPTER X.

It was with very red eyes that Linda found
herself in the presence of Mrs. Grandison,
who, having divested herself of her travel-
ling costume, stood before her, more frigidly
stately than ever, in her full-skirted, hand-
some silk dress and imposing-looking cap.
She stiffly made an inclination, to express
that her guest should walk first into the
dining-room, and treated Linda with the
grave courtesy due to a stranger during
the meal, and when it was concluded they
retired in the same order into the room
into which they had first been ushered.

“My pupils are gone home for their

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

141

Christmas vacation,” she said, when they
were seated. “I have no company to
welcome you, Mrs. Lindsay.”

Linda soon began to feel oppressed by
the weight of the atmosphere of frigidity
which Mrs. Grandison’s present manner
cast around her. What was she to do
during this long evening ? she thought,
whilst casting her eyes despairingly around.

Mrs. Grandison immediately began to
examine the direction of a number of letters
placed upon a small table, on which stood
a lamp by the side of a fauteuil. Linda,
seated opposite, had nothing else to do but
to watch the movements and countenance
of her hostess. She saw her look abstrac-
tedly at the directions of several letters,
but at last she came to one which had been
hidden under the others, all of which she now
hastily cast on one side, and then, with an
impatience very unlike her usual collected

Digitized by LjOOQie
142 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

demeanour, hurriedly opened it, and was-
soon deep in its contents.

Linda thought it must be a foreign letter
from the appearance of the paper. What a
change did its contents produce upon the
countenance of that stem woman! Her face
became paler, but a softness came over its
expression, quite transforming its character;
tender smiles ever and anon played around
her mouth, and then again some tears were
wiped away; and when the last words
seemed to have been read, the first sheet
was taken up again and every word re-
perused. And even when it was at last
reluctantly put down, and Mrs. Grandison
took up the other letters to examine ab-
stractedly their contents, the mind cer-
tainly was not with the task; for often
were they again thrown aside, and again
the other taken up, and some passages
dwelt upon, Linda could easily perceive,

Digitized by

Google
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

143

with such fondness. Once she saw her
press the lines with fervour to her lips,
and they moved as if ejaculating a name!
Could that be the stony-looking woman
who, like a clothed statue, had just done
the honours of her table ?

Linda’s very expressive eyes were fixed
on Mrs. Grandison’s face whilst these ideas
were passing through, her mind, and sud-
denly the lady, who, whilst reading her
letter had totally forgotten even the exist-
ence of her guest, suddenly looked up and
perceived that she was watched. Her face
flushed, and evidently a displeased expres-
sion overspread it; but with cold civility
she said, with her usual dignified manner,—

“ I suppose you have not unpacked your
work-box, Mrs. Lindsay; it must be irksome
to you, I should imagine, doing nothing;
you will find some books and prints upon
that table.”

Digitized by LjOOQie
144 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

“ And Linda, feeling like a detected
criminal, immediately rose to obey her
orders, looked over the prints, and finally
settled herself with a book. After a time
Mrs. Grandison spoke.

“ Have you selected a book you like ? ”
she politely said.

“ Yes, I am very fond of Alfieri.”

“Do you speak Italian?” was asked with
some interest.

“Quite as fluently as English, much
better than French. I never cared for that
language; German, even, I like better.
Italian is my mother tongue.”

There was a long pause. Mrs. Gran-
dison, Linda could perceive, although now
she only very stealthily turned her eyes
towards her, was still absorbed by her
letter; but at length again she spoke.

“ You must be tired to-night, Mrs. Lind-

145

sey, I should imagine, or I would ask you
to give me a little music.”

“ Not at all tired, I can assure you,” Linda
exclaimed, starting up with alacrity; “I
shall be too happy to play or sing.”

“ But you have not, I daresay, unpacked
your music?” Mrs. Grandison said, as she
proceeded to ring the bell for lights for the
pianoforte.

However, saying she should not require
any to-night, indeed, had brought no music
with her, and would prefer not having
lights, Linda gladly sat down to the occu-
pation which almost she loved the most;
and choosing a song which she thought,
in Mrs. Grandison’s present mood, would
be most calculated gently to mingle with
the feelings of tenderness drawn forth by
that foreign letter, Linda sang an Italian
canzonette, of such pathetic pathos, in a
voice of such exquisite plaintive melody,

VOL. I.	L

that soon the heart which had already
heaved high with that sweetest and tender-
est, though saddest of emotions, caused by
the words (though they were but written
ones) from one beloved in a far distant land,
ceased almost in its beatings, whilst in rapt
attention she listened to the strains.

Linda noted the effect she was pro-
ducing. She felt a sort of exultation at the
idea of the power she possessed of melting
the soul; not that she meant to be cruel, far
from it, for with all her faults, the girl
possessed a compassionate heart, but with a
sort of instinctive conviction that she knew
a song which would particularly touch the
heart of her listener, and with an impulse
of curiosity to discover the extent of her
power in exciting her feelings (after having
finished the Italian arietta she had before
commenced), she at once broke forth into
that plaintive air “the Exile’s Home”:—

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

147

“ Where, tell us where, for hearts in sorrow pining,
Where dwells the calm that shall our toil allay ?
Tell us, ye stars, above in glory shining,

Where lies the shore that yet shall all repay ?

Oh there, only there!

“ Shades of the past, whose pilgrim cares are over,
Say ye in dreams who round us kindly come;

Ye from the skies, that here in pity hover,

Where is the wanderer’s home—the exile’s rest?
Oh there, there!”

Every word fell with liquid clearness
upon Mrs. Grandison’s listening ear, and
soon Linda was startled and terrified when
she discovered what passionate emotions
her spell had conjured up. A sudden vibra-
tion on some of the most sensitive chords
of her heart seemed to run through the
whole frame of the stem-looking woman,
and in a moment to open the flood-gates of
her tears. Uncontrollable was the emotion
which now shook the whole frame of one
apparently so strong-minded. She could
l. 2

Digitized by LjOOQie
148 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

not suppress her sobs, which sounded so far
more painful than the ordinary emotion of
women, proceeding from one who seemed so
little given to such tender weakness.

Linda, as usual the creature of impulse,
in a moment was on her knees before Mrs.
Grandison, imploring her forgiveness for
being the cause of her emotion.

“ I ought not to have sung that song; I
know it was wrong of me; it is so sad, it al-
ways makes me feel inclined to weep when
I sing it. But yet, dear Madam,” Linda
continued, “the words must be so comfort-
ing to an exile. Yes, I feel its influence; I,
a poor, miserable, forlorn exile, now know,
that ‘ There, only There,’ can there be rest
for me.”

And Linda buried her face on Mrs. Gran-
dison’s lap, and wept for her own woes.

No words were spoken for some time, but
much was accomplished during that brief
space; and it was a true and honest, though

a rash, wild young heart you pressed to
yours, Mrs. Grandison, and one which kind-
ness would melt and mould to your will.
You may trust her now; though faulty
and impetuous, she will be true to you.

The value of adversity depends upon

Fire will inflame straw, soften iron, or

the object with which it comes in contact.

Linda’s previous existence had been one
of prosperity, but not one of love. It was
a cold atmosphere which she had ever
breathed, and this impetuous nature longed
for something more; her energetic soul
would fain be doing, not merely existing;
she had ever fretted and chafed at her life

of vacuity;—no one to love her, as she fain
would be loved; nothing to do but to saun-
ter through life a nonentity.

Adversity had at once done its trans-
forming work upon her very peculiar tem-
perament. Her very entrance into what
ought to be termed life had become to her
a snare, a peril. She had rushed into it with
a heart as buoyant as a fresh morning to the
skylark, but for every step she had taken in
that path she had now something to mourn,
to deplore. But sorrow had been good for
Linda. They were now seated side by side,
the lady and the girl on the sofa—Mrs.
Grandison talking long and in a gentle
voice. She was uninterrupted by her
listener, who sat drinking in every word
she spoke, and then, when the lady ceased
to speak, she murmured: “All, all shall
be done as you wish; you will not repent,
dear Madam, that you have befriended me;”
and she erected her head with a degree of

dignity, a new phase in her deportment.
“I hope, with all my faults, I possess an
honourable heart; and believe me when I
say, though my present appearance may,
under such mysterious circumstances, belie
my words, that I am no low-born adven-
turer, I shall never at least, come what may,
be a disgrace to you; and oh, Madam, how
can I sufficiently express my overwhelming
gratitude ? ” she added, melting into tears
of tenderness.

Music, which she was called upon every
night to perform, was evidently the greatest
source of delight to Mrs. Grandison, who
soon discovered how soignie the young
girl’s education had been; and then her
manners and language, how perfectly lady-
like and well-bred they were!

“ Yes, she is exactly what I want,” was
the reiterated exclamation. “ But this silence,
this mystery!—I know not how to decide.”

But few days more and the pupils were to
arrive.

Mrs. Grandison became grave and ab-
stracted, and Linda’s heart began to sink.

“ I shall have to go,” she would exclaim
when she was alone in her little room.
“Yes, I see plainly Mrs. Grandison will
not keep me any longer without some ex-
planation ; but I cannot, I cannot tell her.”
And it was with very red eyes the poor
girl again encountered Mrs. Grandison;
and so passed the three next days, nothing
having transpired upon that subject.

She little guessed what a reciprocal feeling

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

153

was struggling in the heart of her formid-
able-looking hostess.

At length the crisis came. They had
finished breakfast, which had been a silent
meal, both evidently engrossed by troubled
thoughts. With a start Linda heard her-
self addressed:

“ Mrs. Lindsey, the time has arrived
when we must come to some understanding
or part. 'Your own good sense will point
out to you how impossible it will be for me
to retain you under my roof, as the com-
panion to my twenty pupils, unless I know
something of your previous history.”

Mrs. Grandison paused, but no answer
did she receive. Linda sat speechless, her
hands pressed tightly together, looking the
pale image of despair.

At last she rose, and said in a voice,
almost inaudible from choking sobs she in
vain endeavoured to restrain,—

“Yes, Mrs. Grandison, I know that I
must go, for I cannot, must not, tell you
who I am; you have been kind, most kind,
and I shall be always grateful for what you
have already done. You are quite right;
you could not let me stay, still doubting
me; though God is my witness when I
declare that you have not been sheltering
one of whom you need be ashamed. I have
been, no doubt, a very foolish girl, but not a
disgraceful one. I can swear solemnly that
I was lawfully married, but,” and she
clasped her hands in agony, “ my husband
is gone from me for ever; and as for my
friends, I never will return to them. This
I can solemnly declare; parents, I have
none.”

And thus having spoken, Linda rushed
from the room, and regained her sleeping
apartment in a state of excitement and
agony truly pitiable.

“ Oh, Mrs. Lewis, Mrs. Lewis! ” she ex-
claimed, “ you are the only one who really
compassionated my forlorn condition; you
did not turn from me, though I told you
as little as I have done Mrs. Grandison.
Yes, I must go, and that immediately,” and
with her usual impetuosity Linda dragged
forth her trunk, and began hastily to
deposit in it the contents of the drawers,
her tears all the while falling thickly whilst
thus engaged. She little imagined that a
pair of eyes were intently watching her
movements.

The door of the small room leading into
the one occupied by Mrs. Grandison was
ajar, and that lady, who had soon followed
Linda, really distressed at the state in
which she had quitted her presence, had
intended, although, indeed, her intentions
were very vague and undefined, to persist
in her endeavours to prevail upon her to

Digitized by LjOOQie

be more explicit; but the sight of the poor
girl thus engaged, the wretchedness of her
appearance, her unfeigned grief, and evident
determination to rush upon the wide world
rather than tell who she was, touched the
really warm heart of the cold seeming
woman.

It was affecting to see the poor childish-
looking girl endeavouring, with her trem-
bling hands, to perform what was evidently
an unaccustomed labour, that of packing.
Her widow’s cap had been flung off, as it al-
ways was when she was alone, and her
hair, hanging wildly about her tear-stained
face, impetuously every moment was thrust
back, displaying her face disfigured by
weeping.

“ Poor, poor child! ” Mrs. Grandison’s
heart began to suggest, “ how unfit she is
to be sent abroad to buffet with this rude
world!—but what can I do ? With all these

pupils given so confidingly to my care,
how should I be able to answer to their
parents, their guardians, if any evil came
from companionship with this stranger?
I have watched her well during the month
she has been with me, and I have detected
nought that is wrong in her, save a childish
impetuosity of character, which, with time
and proper management,would, I am certain,
be soon controlled. She has been evidently
educated in a superior manner, and possesses
first-rate abilities'; and, as far as I can judge,
and I have studied her deeply, has no guile
in her naturally, but rather, on the contrary,
though rash and impulsive, is more inno-
cent and backward, with regard to anything
approaching to evil, than most girls of her
age; but this mystery and her obstinate
silence, what can they mean ? But, good
heavens! how can I turn her out of the
house without a friend to protect her?”

And now Mrs. Grandison, evidently pain-
fully perplexed, walked several times to
and fro across the apartment. Most cer-
tainly there was a hard struggle in her
heart going forward between compassion
and prudence, and again she went and looked
through the half-closed door, and then she
saw Linda still on her knees, endeavouring
to make room for the last article, which
she was vainly trying to press into the
trunk. Prudence was fairly beginning to
give way to the overpowering effects of
the compassion rising in so full a flood in
Mrs. Grandison’s heart. “ Poor, poor child,
she is in no way fit to go alone; come what
may I will give her a trial. At the very
shadow of anything approaching to evil
she shall go; but now, weak mortal as I
really am, I cannot send her away.”

And, without giving herself time for any
more reflection, she gently entered unper-

ceived, and laid her hand upon the shoulder
of the still kneeling girl.

Linda started and looked round; what
an altered face she beheld! All sternness
had passed from Mrs. Grandison’s expres-
sion ; tears stood in her eyes. It was like
the look Linda had seen when the foreign
letter was being read,— so tender and yet
so sad,—that at once the impulsive girl
was on her feet, her arms encircling the
neck of the woman of whom, but a brief
hour ago, she stood in such solemn awe,
sobbing forth —

“Then you will trust me—you will
not send me away ? ”

Linda had secured a friend.

In vain Mrs. Grandison endeavoured to
look stem and dignified, to keep up the
character she ever tried to enact: she was,
indeed, in heart but a weak woman.

It would not do; her softer nature soon

Digitized by LjOOQie
160 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

rose to the ascendant; and she could not
repulse the poor clinging girl, but tenderly
pressed her to her heart.

“ Oh, Mrs. Grandison! ” Linda now
sobbed, “ then I may stay ? And you will
never have reason to repent of your kind-
ness. I will work for you day and night,
so joyfully, so earnestly; it will be my
only happiness on earth to please you.
How can I express my gratitude, my thank-
fulness? I have not words to tell all I
feel.”

“ You need not express it,” interrupted
Mrs. Grandison; “ deeds, not words, will
amply repay me. Now go and unpack
your trunk, my dear.”

And the lady arose, — again the stately,
stern-looking woman.

and the young teacher might be seen taking
her part steadily, assiduously, in all the
duties of her present vocation. Marvel-
lously altered in appearance seemed Linda.
She was just of an age when every day
makes a difference in the looks of a girl;
and her very altered expression of coun-
tenance, added to the other visible changes
in her demeanour, was most striking. ,

The eyes once so restless, emitting such
quick glances around, were now softer, more
fixed and meditative, as if the thoughts of
-her heart were graver, calmer. There was
■ more of peacefulness in her look; and
though she smiled often and pleasantly, the
boisterous, though at the same time me-
lodious laugh which echoed through Mrs.
Lewis’s small abode, was never heard.

A change had, indeed, come over Linda.

“ Now, Miss Caroline, pray don't make
all this dreadful noise. Cannot you come
into a room without making such a racket,
startling the poor baby in its sleep ? ” ex-
claimed, in an irritated tone, an important
looking nurse, who was seated before the
fire with a child on her knee. This ad-
monition was addressed to a girl who
rushed impetuously into the nursery.

“ Oh, you grumbling old creature, I shall
do the brat no harm; don’t you know that
‘ nought is never in danger,’ and a seventh
son! of what use can he be ?”

The nurse shrugged her shoulders, and
looked daggers at the speaker.

“ Yes, of what use can he be ? Mamma
ought to be ashamed of herself for going
on having so many children, and with a
daughter of nineteen, presuming to own one
so young. These tiresome monkeys coming
into the world only to curtail their elders
of every enjoyment;— pests and plagues in
every sense of the word!”

“ Oh, Miss Caroline, Miss Caroline, it is
quite dreadful to hear you talk,” said the
nurse, in a tone of deep concern; and then
she added, indignantly, “But don’t come
talking in that wicked manner here; you
have no business in my nursery at any rate,
and I won’t have you in it talking this way,
that’s just the long and short of the matter;

so if you cannot---”

“ Hoity, toity, old woman! ” said the girl,
putting her hand before the nurse’s mouth,
and preventing her from finishing her
speech, at the same time throwing an arm

caressingly round her neck and kissing
her, “ what a bad humour you are in, you
old bore, taking all I say for gospel! — you
know I dote upon, and am very sorry for
that poor little wretch (darling, I mean, of
course), but at the same time you must
forgive me for my lack of any great tender-
ness towards him, for, do you know, my
head was felt the other day by a phreno-
logist, and he discovered that I do not
possess in the slightest degree the bump
of philoprogenitiveness, so how can I help
it?”

“Bump of nonsense! ” the nurse exclaimed,
“ Oh, Miss Caroline, many a heartache you
give me, that I can say with truth; don’t
I often tell you, Miss Geraldine, how un-
happy I am when I think of your sister’s
strange sayings and doings ? ”

which, for fear of Mrs. Nelson’s indigna-
tion, she tried to smother by pressing her
pocket-handkerchief against her mouth.
When she had recovered her composure
she continued: “ Ah, poor Gerry, you are
the very person I came to seek. I knew
you would be moaning here with this cross
old woman, Nelson, and weeping over that
animated piece of flesh, our blessed seventh
brother.”

This tirade was addressed to a pale, grave-
looking girl of sixteen, who was sitting in a
desponding attitude dose to the nurse.

“So, unfortunate little misery, you are
really to be off to-morrow to Paris, to be
again incarcerated for one whole year within
the walls of that dungeon-looking abode,
watched over by the grim she Cerberus who

cheer you up, and have a look at Paris, but
he will not hear of it! Expense again! —
always, always talking of that odious money,
or rather the want of it; and what provokes
me more than anything, always ringing the
changes with that horrid speech about ‘ the
large family; ’ upon my word, people are so
anxious to marry, and what for I should
like to know? but ‘to suckle brats and
chronicle small beer.’ ”

“ Now, seriously, Miss Caroline, this will
never do; the rubbish you talk beats my
understanding. No wonder your Papa and
Mamma go to the expense of sending your
sister away, to get her out of sight and
sound of you and your bad example; I
wish with all my heart you were married
and done for.” And Mrs. Nelson waxed
exceeding wrathful, but Car, who delighted
in exciting a rise out of the nurse, by ex-
posing her very ultra views upon most

subjects, went on to say: “ Mamed! I marry!
defend me from that dreadful alternative
for many a long day; some ten years hence
I may begin to think of it; not before, I
can tell you.”

Mrs. Nelson groaned, and rocked the
child, who began to move, with an im-
patient gesture.

“ Oh, Car! ” now interposed the gentle
voice of Geraldine, “ and yet how you went
on, and what trouble you gave about all
those men you flirted with! ”

“ Oh, hold your tongue, you little idiot,”
interrupted the sister; “ what do you know
about the matter? ‘ Went on,’ indeed, and

play a new game, but I’ll have none of your
young ones, your boys, I can tell you. I
intend to marry for position, and I don’t
care how old, ugly, or disagreeable the
creature may be; my mark will be the
loaves and fishes.”

“ But, Car, some of them were not so very
young, and had position as you call it—I
mean Lord —:—”

“ Hold your tongue! ” again interrupted
Car Eversfield ; “ I flirted with them out of
pure mischief; I was determined to get
them into my clutches, that was all. But
come away, Gerry; don’t you hear that
odious sound, that din of worse than battle-
field, the Philistines approaching ? Oh,

nursery door opened, and a host of hats
and feathers appeared, worn by small child-
ren, and their elder sister, with a gesture
of disgust, rushed past them, and in a

moment disappeared. Geraldine remained,
and was soon surrounded by the little
group, assisting in removing their walking
things, and caressing them with the femi-
nine tenderness of an elder sister. And
nurse Nelson looked at her, and with a sad
shake of her head was thinking, “Who
could believe those two girls were sisters,
— children of the same parents ? ”

The girls we have just brought before
our readers were the daughters of General
Sir Hector Eversfield and Lady Julia his
wife. He was an officer of much distinc-
tion, possessing what would be considered
an ample fortune, were it not for the
incumbrance of the twelve children his
daughter has informed us were added to his
possessions.

Caroline was the eldest of the family, a
son the next, who had just entered the
foot-guards; the rest of all ages, a nursery

fall of little ones, to the great disgnst of
the vivacious Car, who was far too full of
her own special plans of amusement, to
bear with patience the largely divided share
of her parents’ attention to her exigeantes
demands.

In a large family it is surprising to ob-
serve how strangely the several members
of which it consists, vary in every respect—
appearance, temper, in every quality, both of
the mind and heart — with the same blood
running through the veins, how totally
opposed in character as well as features,
partaking little apparently of the nature
even of the parents who gave them birth.
And a contrast indeed it was to look upon the
mother and the daughter, as Car Eversfield,
on her way from the nursery, passing an
open door, abruptly entered the room, and
stood before Lady Julia Eversfield, a fair
faded woman, who was busily employed in

superintending the packing of a trunk des-
tined for Geraldine.

“ My dear Car,” she exclaimed, in a low-
voice, “ you really always startle me by the
noisy manner in which you rush into a
room; when will you, darling, ever learn to
be more gentle, more, really I must say it,
ladylike?”

“ Oh, Mamma, it is not my nature, I never
shall be different, nor do I much care to be
what people call ladylike, and what I call
a piece of stupidity; you are always finding
fault with me, but others do not think my
manners so disagreeable.”

And Car pouted, doing no disparagement
to the reddest and fullest of beautiful lips.

M My dear child, I must find fault with
you until I find your manners ’soften and
improve. I can assure you, your Papa was
talking only this morning of your boisterous
ways, of the manner in which you conduct

Digitized by LjOOQie
172 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

yourself; so differently from what we like
to see in our daughters; even, he says, when
you are riding in the park, for instance.”

“ Oh good gracious, Mamma, if you go on
in this manner I shall be off,” cried the
impetuous girl, putting her hands to her
ears, and rushing forth, never stopping
until reaching the drawing-room, where,
seeing the window open, and hearing the
sound of a military band, she was in an in-
stant upon the balcony, watching a battalion
of the foot-guards marching past from the
park, and kissing her hand with much era-
pressement to some of the officers who cast
their glances upwards from amidst the
overhanging shade of their bearskins.

A beautiful Hebe-looking creature was
Car Eversfield, her complexion clear and
blooming, with the bright hue of health and
youth; her eyes dark and dazzling, lips full
and red, and when parted by those dimpled

smiles which were ever hovering round her
mouth, disclosing the finest and whitest of
teeth. And her figure was symmetry itself;
above the middle height, but every limb so
beautifully rounded, rather inclining, we
might add, to embonpoint. Yes, she was, to
use rather a broad term, voluptuously lovely,
this girl, as she stood thus conspicuously
on that balcony, surrounded by plants and
flowers, waving her handkerchief as the
soldiers passed by, greeting several acquain-
tances amongst the gallant band with—

“ Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles,

Such as hung on Hebe’s cheek,”

forming a most alluring picture to all the
present passers by, excepting one individual,
who at that moment crossed over the street
—her father. Car’s quick eye soon saw
him approaching, and also noted the annoyed
expression upon his kind face.

“ Oh, good gracious! ” she exclaimed “ now
I’m in for it with a vengeance! Now that
dear man, though he is what he is called, an
indulgent father, is at this moment thinking
that he would dearly like to shut me up in
the guard-room, or put a log round my leg, or
even, though I suppose that fashion has gone
by, summoning a drum-head court-martial
. and inflicting fifty lashes upon his wicked
daughter. Oh, here he comes; well, I must
bluster it out, or coax him, as well as I can.”

And Car turned her face towards her
father, so animated and brilliant, and at once
exclaimed, approaching the General who en-
tered the room, caressingly: “Nowdarling
Papa, don’t scold me; remember I am a sol-
dier’s daughter and can never resist the sound
of the drums and fifes; I could not help step-
ping out into the balcony to look at those fine
fellows. Now you shall not be angry with
me,” she continued, as the General began

in a severe manner with “Really, Car,”
stopping his mouth by many a sweet kiss
and blandishment, and ending at length by
fairly vanquishing the man who was stout-
hearted as a lion but in one small corner of
his heart, and that was his too yielding
love for this, his headstrong daughter.

“ Well, I won’t be angry, then,” at length
he found means to say; “ but------”

“ Oh! that ‘but,’ that horrid ‘but,’means
all sorts of dreadful things. That it was
wicked of me, I will confess, to be seen on
the balcony bowing to the officers, and un-
ladylike, as mamma would say; and that
no wonder you are shocked and ashamed
of your poor Car. But she will change and
be a piece of starch, stiff formality, or you
will cease to love her and make her so
happy by your love as you have always
hitherto done, darling, darling Papa, ever
since she can remember anything.”

And now the girl tried to play the pathetic,
and certainly looked so very beautiful in
this well-acted expression of her counte-
nance, that the doting father, quite softened,
only said,—

“ Well, well, we will say no more about
it at present; but, Car, you cannot imagine
how bold you looked standing there, the
wind blowing about your petticoats, nod-
ding so familiarly to those men. It is not
the habit of modest girls to make them-
selves so conspicuous.”

“ Well, dear Pappy, I won’t do it never
no more. The next time I hear the band,
I will let down the blinds and shut the
shutters, and only peep through the cre-
vices. And please don’t tell mamma, for
you see she is already in a fuss about
Geraldine to-day, and that makes her a little
cross,— nervous, of course, I mean,— and
she has a bad enough opinion of poor me
already.”

The General promised silence. And
thus it was that Car Eversfield generally

very soft and yielding under the influence

At this very moment a carriage passed,
out of which was seen the brightest of faces
and one kissing her hand to the two young
men with the utmost empressement.

“What a lovely creature she certainly
is!” exclaimed Captain Ashton, the elder
of the two officers. “I remember last year,

in love with her.”

“ Well, it was certainly something of the

is not half slaked. She evidently now has
her eye upon Lawless, who will prove such
an easy victim with his uncontrollable feel-
ings. If I had daughters,” the young man
continued to soliloquise, “I would rather
see them unformed, old-fashioned, awkward
country girls all their lives, than the most
vaunted, the most admired of London young

bring them here at all; the very atmosphere
is tainted,' poisonous to simplicity and mo-
desty ; and a girl in some sets, after what is
called a regular London season, comes up to
my idea of that very trite old remark, of
the bloom being rubbed off the peach, no
longer fresh, or pure, or desirable, after hav-
ing been seen and handled by so many; my

I am,” he sighed, “ how am I ever to catch
the mother of my daughters ? ”

These two young men had been friends
from childhood; Cyril Ashton the elder by a
few years of the two. Norman Lawless was
an only child, with far higher prospects. His
father was an Irish viscount, who had mar-
ried a Scotch heiress of considerable wealth,
which was very necessary to prop up his
wasted fortune and repair the walls of
Castle Lawless, the family seat in Ireland,
which, from want of means, was speedily
falling into utter decay.

We fear that it was dire necessity alone
which had induced Lord Turraghmore to
offer his handsome person and empty purse
to this very unattractive Scotch woman.
Norman Lawless, whom we have just

ir 4

introduced to our readers, was the only son
of this marriage. From his earliest days
he had exercised unlimited control over his
stem and frigid mother. Soldiering hav-
ing been his hobby ever since he had been
strong enough to wield a baby sword,
after Eton, and a year or two at Oxford,
he had wrung from his parents a reluctant
consent for him to go into the Guards,
and we now present him to our readers at
-the age of twenty-two, having joined at a
late period. But that little mattered to
one who had no need of the army as a pro-
fession. He was a fine-looking young man,
certainly; monopolising the beauty of the
family, and inheriting much of his father’s
Irish nature and little of his mother’s cold,
calculating prudence.

Never having been controlled as a boy,
now as a man he brooked no interference
which militated against his inclinations, or

thwarted his indomitable will. Norman
Lawless could be an agreeable companion,
open-handed and hearty in his demeanour
to those he liked, and who were subservient
to his will, but cross his path, interfere with
his determined will, and then did his expres-
sion change, his countenance assume a look
so sinister and excitable as to cause an un-
pleasant feeling to those who looked upon it.

In a short time after Norman Lawless
had passed, mounted on his beautiful horse,
he might again have been seen, his arm
leaning upon the window sill of Lady
Julia’s close carriage, in which, much to her
daughter’s disgust, she was incarcerated
this beautiful afternoon. One of the chil-
dren had been indisposed, and was having
its first airing. Car’s horse was lame, and
she could not have her ride, and as for
leaving her at home alone, Lady Julia never
considered that an expedient act.

was also cast upon some other passer-by,
who looked with envious eye upon the place

Oh ! ye mothers of England who groan,
beneath the burden of large families, cease
to murmur, and bear the weight with forti-

It is a comforting adage to those who
consider their quivers rather over full, that
“ large families generally do best,” and cer-
tainly it is wonderful to observe how often
a numerous progeny do get on mighty well,
in households where one might have sup-

But numbers certainly do greatly in-
crease our family cares; it is quite an
erroneous theory, whatever may be said, on
the subject of only children being the hea-
viest of burdens to parents. Our cares are
at least concentrated when there is only one,
instead of the poor divided heart, here and
there and everywhere, yearning after sons
and daughters, either separated by distance
or troubling the mind by other anxieties
equally distressing. It is the idea of Car
Eversfield which has induced us thus to
digress so gloomily; this one of a large
family, a girl so fair, so bewitching to look
upon, and yet the one who added a hundred
fold of weight to the cares of her parents,
her mother in particular.

The General was too much under the
spell of the fascination of his beautiful
daughter, to look upon her faults and fail-
ings with eyes rendered so clear-sighted

by anxiety as her mother’s; but poor Lady
Julia, who was of a nervous temperament,
and her health rather delicate, watched
with daily increasing affright the develop-
ing character of this daughter (who, though
she had always been a troublesome child to
manage, enraging the nurses, waging war
with the governesses, tormenting, not so
much in malice as in fun, her brothers and
sisters), had been nevertheless a favourite
with every one. We fear her beauty had
much to do with the supremacy she ac-
quired, her playful vivacity adding to her
attractive charms, her faults all seeming, in
those young days, to spring from a love of
mischief more than naughtiness. Certainly
she was petted and indulged far above the
other more deserving children, and it be-
came the custom of the house to succumb
to her whims and fancies, perhaps as much
for the sake of a quiet life as for any other
reason.

Lady Julia, when the General was away,
had often tried to exercise some discipline
upon her volatile daughter, but any little
improvement that had been achieved was
soon entirely destroyed on her father’s
return.

His unbounded love and admiration
blinded his eyes to the perils which sur-
rounded this spoilt one, and the mother
felt powerless to interfere.

Sometimes, after too glaring an escapade,
the General was roused to anger and dis-
approbation, but this soon melted away, and
was forgotten, after a few sharp words had
been spoken, and a tear dropped from the
bright eyes of his offending daughter.

“ Never mind, Julia,” he would say in
private to his wife; “ she will be all right,
when she is a little older, she will steady
down, depend upon it; you think far too
seriously of her madcap ways; I wish she

could impart a little of her exuberance to
Geraldine. What a quiet little mouse she
is!”

“Yes, compared to her sister most cer-
tainly,” was the reply; “ but oh, Hector,
defend me from two Cars. I look with
terror upon all the other girls, fearing they
may have some of her nature in them; but
as yet, I am thankful to say, I have not
perceived anything approaching to her dis-
position. But ‘ forewarned, forearmed.’
Car was always indulged and encouraged
in her wayward flights. I take care to
bring the others up very differently. Dear
Geraldine is all that I can desire as a
daughter, gentle, obedient, and affectionate.
I grieve to part with her, but it is quite
necessary. I cannot keep her here at her
age, her mind in a transition state between
a child and a woman, with such an example
before her as poor Car.”

“ Upon my word, my lady,” exclaimed

Digitized by LjOOQie
192 I'ASSAGES IN THE LIFE OE

the General, waxing rather wroth at this
censure of his darling, “ I think you take a
most harsh view of the innocent foibles and
follies of your daughter. I see nothing in
them but the exuberance of high spirits.
Car enjoys everything with all the energy
and freshness of youth and light hearted-
ness. She has no guile in her composition,
depend upon it, and when a little sobered
(I must allow she requires some bringing
down from her high stilts), will do very
well. We must try and find her by and by
some husband who will take care of her;
some quiet prudent man, no highflyer like
herself.”

Lady Julia shook her head despondingly,
and then said with a sigh,

“ Oh that is a very sore subject to me.
Such a husband as you describe, I fear she
will never attain; and do you know,
Hector, that one of my great sources of
disquiet on Car’s account is the manner in

which she scouts the idea of matrimony,
always declaring that it will be many a
. day before she gives up her ‘ glorious
liberty,’ as she calls it; not, she says, till
she is at least eight-and-twentv, and then
she intends to marry for position, not love ;
such unfeminine, unnatural ideas for a
young creature like her! ”

The General knitted his brows for a
moment,' and then the partial smile beamed
again.

“What a curious girl she is!” he said.
“ But Julia, you take far, far too seriously
all the nonsense she talks ; just wait till
the right man comes, and then see if Car
will not tell a different story; a few years
hence, when she is older and steadier.”

, “ A few years hence,” groaned the
mother; and she added, with a deep sigh,
“ she will have worn me to death long
before a few years have passed.”

“ I suppose we of the fast sort think so,”

over the radiant face; “that would, indeed,
be a dreadful way of gaining liberty, even
if by that means it might be gained. But

far heavier than those I already wear,
although they might be made of gold; just
look at him, for here he comes! did you
ever see such a silly, dolorous-looking
creature ? It amuses me to tease and vex
him sometimes, to make him think that I
am coming round, after all; although lately
he has been queerish in his ways, I can tell
you, beginning, I believe, to understand
me too well. But you know, Milly, I have
just now another victim caught safely in
my net; that young Lawless!—so I could
amuse myself very well, if it were not for
Mamma, who is so -—”

Car was interrupted by the sudden prox-
imity of the two strings to her bow, of
which she was at this moment boasting.
A good-looking, very young man had
ridden up to her side from the opposite
direction; so close, indeed, was he at her
elbow, that she was startled by the thought

Digitized by Google
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

197

that he might have heard his name, just
fallen from her lips, and the sudden blush
which rose to her cheeks not only made
her more than ever beautiful, but impressed
the young officer with the delightful hope
that it might be some favourable feeling
toward* nimselt which'caused the tell-tale
suffusion.

But only for a second was this pleasing
idea allowed to remain upon his mind; for
Car, with some petulance, exclaimed —

“ How you startled me, Mr. Lawless! if
it had been my brother Albert, I should
most assuredly have boxed his ears. Don’t
you know that I am as nervous as a deer ?”

“ No, certainly, I did not,” was the re-
ply. “ Of all people in the world I should
have said that you were the last to come
at all under the class of nervous subjects.”

“ Now, Mr. Lawless, if you mean that as
a compliment, you have quite missed your

Digitized by LjOOQie
198 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

mark. You meant to insinuate that 1 am
a hard, ironminded girl, with none of the
pretty weaknesses^ of my sex; a bold, strong
creature, possessing nerve sufficient to do
anything, beginning from dancing upon the
tightrope (which, by the by, I have always
longed to do) to thrusting my head into a
tiger’s mouth and taming wild beasts; now
is not that what you really think ? You
cannot deny it, — I see by your guilty
face.”

Young Lawless began an earnest refu-
tation of this accusation, but Car had ceased
to listen to him ; she was engaged in talk-
ing to Lord Sinclair, who was now riding
on her other side.

Lord Sinclair was about thirty-two or
thirty-three years old; looking perhaps
older than his age, his countenance grave
and thoughtful; the very last man one
might have imagined to be captivated by a

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

199

girl like Car Eversfield, whose appearance
and manners were the very reverse of what
we could have imagined to be his beau ideal
of a young lady.

But there is no accounting for such ir-
regularities in the human mind. Love, or
that attraction of the fancy which leads to
the desire of possession, is quite a discon-
nected feeling in the nature of man; it
does not hinge upon a single characteristic
of an individual, nor on any of his previous
tastes, habits, or feelings, but

“ ‘ The power of Love! ’

Who can withstand its all-powerful influence ? ”

And so it was with Lord Sinclair. His
reigning passion from a boy had been
music, in which he excelled as a performer;
and, till he had seen Car Eversfield, any
attention he had hitherto paid to young
ladies was circumscribed towards those

O 4

Digitized by LjOOQie
200 PASSAGES IN THE LITE OF

who could enter into this his absorbing
taste. There were several debutanti furiore
who had hoped they had gained some foot-
ing in his heart by the pleasure he had
evinced in their performance, and the
hours he had willingly spent in their
society, practising with them, accompany-
ing the pianists with his cornopean, or even
violin, and joining his fine barytone voice
in their duets and trios. But they would,
indeed, have been mortified, these hopeful
aspirants, had they been aware that they
were considered, by this most valuable parti,
merely in the same light as a musical in-
strument, or professor of some utility.
Nothing further ever resulted from these
marked attentions; although his family
were always of opinion that whenever he
did marry it must surely be to some finished
musician; and Lady Sunderland, most
anxious to see her only son settled in life,

Digitized by

Google
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

201

spared no pains to draw around her all the
singing and playing young ladies of any
consideration, in the hope of seriously at-
tracting his attentions.

But vain were the endeavours; a mother’s
labour in the case of matrimony is too often
lost time and trouble.

It was at a concert, in the midst of the
most absorbing music, that Lord Sinclair’s
attention was attracted, by the feeling of
great annoyance he was undergoing, by
hearing the sound close behind him of in-
cessant talking and laughing going on, at a
crisis of a song which ought to have en-
raptured every one and silenced every
tongue; no longer able to endure it, he
suddenly and angrily turned round and
faced the offender. And there she stood,
that dimpled Hebe — Car Eversfield, her
bright eyes sparkling with light and fun.
At once she understood the state of the

Digitized by LjOOQie
202 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

case; perfectly was she aware how she had
disgusted and outraged this well-known
fanatico per la musica — but what cared
she ?

Indeed, from that moment a thought had
darted into her versatile mind.

“ I’ll make him think of something else
besides that tiresome music,” was her de-
termination ; and, without losing any more
time, her eyes were fixed steadily, with a
glance she knew well how to bend, upon
those of the now abashed and stricken Lord
Sinclair, who felt at once their miraculous
power. How changed in a moment were
his feelings, considering himself the culprit
for having dared with so impatient a ges-
ture, and so frowning a brow, to look
upon one so surpassingly lovely. When
the song was ended, Car whispered in his
ear—

“ Lord Sinclair, I ought, I know, to apo-

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

203

logise for my want of taste and good-breed-
ing in making such a noise when Novello
was singing. I fear you will henceforward
shun my proximity in a concert-room.”

She had never been introduced to Lord
Sinclair, hut she knew him well by sight,
as they met frequently at the same parties;
and Lord Sinclair may have also known
her by name, and perhaps, in a general way,
in person, but probably had really never
looked at her before; but Car cared not a
rush for this.

She felt determined to make his acquain-
tance and hook the shy fish, as she afterwards
told Millicent Danniers, her intimate friend
and gossip; by that she meant, “make him
in love with her.” And Lord Sinclair, per-
fectly overwhelmed with contrition, his blood
tingling with a new-born sensation, whilst
under the influence of those dazzling eyes,
now so beseechingly fixed upon him, stam-

Digitized by LjOOQie
204 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

mered oat something about his being the
person to apologise, and then offered his
arm to lead her into the refreshment-room,
the first part of the concert being over.

From this moment may be dated poor
Lord Sinclair’s defeat; for the first time in
his life he felt irretrievably attracted, even
after he had heard from her own lips that
she cared little for music, and that no master
or mistress could ever succeed in teaching
her. Not even then did his admiration cool,
—no, Car was determined that it should not;
and she told him the truth with such a. de-
preciating expression, was so sorry, she de-
clared, to be obliged to confess this lowering
fact, that a man, who had proclaimed that
music was a sine qud non in a woman, began
to think that it could not add to the per-
fection of the lovely one before him.

And thus it went on, Car glorying in this
conquest above any that she had ever yet

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

205

made. “ This man of all others,” she would
boast, “the grave, impenetrable old fogy,
who had never considered a woman but in
the light of an embodied pianoforte, now to
be over head and heels in love with me, who
do not know a crotchet from a quaver,
or ‘ God save the Queen ’ from ‘ Hoop-de-
dooden-do.’ ”

And so it went on; poor Lady Julia re-
joicing, though in trembling, thinking what
a safe, excellent marriage this would be for
her most .troublesome child, —splendid as to
position, — and what was much better, the
really right-minded woman thought,—such
a good man.

“ But,” she repeated, “ what an extraordi-
nary marriage it would be for Lord Sinclair
to make! — the very last likely to suit his
tastes and habits; and Car, what a changed
life it would be to her! ” Thus Lady Julia
thought and felt during this second season

Digitized by LjOOQie
206 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

of her daughter’s appearance in the gay
world, whilst she watched Lord Sinclair’s
unceasing attentions, and also with terror
Car’s escapades, her perfect disregard of
the proprieties of life, receiving attentions
from every man who came near her; at one
moment overwhelming Lord Sinclair with
her fascinating wiles, the next plunging him
into despair by her outrageous conduct
towards others.

The General was a great deal away on
military business this spring, and the poor
mother had to accompany this vexatiously
anxious charge to every description of
dissipation; herself in delicate.health, and
her heart in her nursery full of babes.

In vain she talked and lectured; Car

/

laughed at all she said. But one day after
Lady Julia had implored her to be more cir-
cumspect for the sake of her future well-
being, “ for,” she added, “ you may depend

207

upon it, Car, Lord Sinclair will never propose
to you if you continue to conduct yourself in,
I really must call it, so improper a manner;
last night, for instance, were you not miss-
ing for hours at the ball ? and then you
appeared from the garden with young Law-
less. I watched Lord Sinclair’s countenance,
he looked thoroughly disgusted and an-
noyed”—“Lord Sinclair!” Car exclaimed;
“and do you think I care that for what he
thinks ?” and she snapped her fingers with
a contemptuous gesture. “ I’ll make him
propose to me before the week is out, and
then you will see what I shall do.”

And thus saying, she bounced out of the
room, leaving her poor mother more than
ever overwhelmed, her only comfort at the
moment being to sit down to write to Sir
Hector, imploring him, if possible, to come
to her rescue, for that, really, Car was far
beyond her management.

“ Propose to me he shall! ” was Car Evers-
field’s fixed determination; “ as for marrying
him,” she continued to ponder, “ catch me
doing such a slow thing; he is the very
last man on earth I could endure to wed.
I would rather live in a barrack all my life
with one of those young guardsmen, with
twopence a year, than encounter the dul-
ness of a splendid existence with Lord
Sinclair; however, I am not going to be
dropt by him. No, he shall ask me, just
that I may have the pleasure of saying
‘No.’”

So resolved, at the ball that night, our

so superior one might have imagined to the
allurements of such a girl as Car Eversfield,
who possessed no one attraction but her
beauty.

But so it is, and so it ever will be.

Strong men have always one vulnerable
spot, however iron-cased appear their na-
tures. Only find out what that weakness
is, and the result is certain.

Car Eversfield, quick-sighted in such
matters, had speedily discovered that this
grave, pre-occupied-looking man, his imagi-
nation fenced around hitherto by the pur-
suit which had been from his infancy the
absorbing delight of his life, had scarcely
yet given a thought to other attractive
feelings.

What a triumph to be the first to thaw;
that frozen heart!

And this she had accomplished; her
witcheries had infected his whole being, he
was an altered man, and would gladly have
succumbed at once without a struggle.

But Car, as soon as she perceived that her
end was gained, and that her victim was
fairly entangled in the meshes of her net,
was quite satisfied. She cared not for more,
and leaving him to struggle free as he might,
flew off to some new scheme of conquest,
fixing upon young Lawless as her next
prey.

Lord Sinclair’s eyes began to see more
clearly what was the nature of the woman
he now loved with the intensity of a first
grande passion. He knew her to be false,
fickle, cruel, but still he could not disengage
himself from the chains with which her at-
tractions had loaded him ; — no, still he
fiercely loved, though it was with a different
feeling that he regarded her; it was pas-

sion, not the reverential devotion of a man,
who considers the goddess of his idolatry
more in the light of an angel than a woman.

However, of late he had ceased to impor-
tune her with his marked attentions; he en-
deavoured to struggle against the infatua-
tion which was changing his very nature,
lowering him in his own estimation, and at-
tracting the attention of his own family by
the alteration of his habits and demeanour.
No ! it would never do; he must shake it
off, cost what it might; he would leave
London as soon as he possibly could,—some
important business at the moment detained
him there; in the meantime, should he meet
her again, he would be decided in his changed
manner towards the girl; would show her
that he did not choose to be made a fool
of. He acted upon this resolve, and
Caroline soon perceived that two could play
at the same game, and that Lord Sinclair,

desperately in love as he decidedly was, did
not intend to stand any more nonsense.

So, acting upon this discovery, the heart-
less coquette changed her tack, and again
put forth the whole artillery of her charms
to draw once more to her side her receding
lover. Splendidly handsome she looked

that night at D-----House, where a large

ball was given. Her dress was exquisite
in its simplicity and good taste. Before
starting, when Car had entered the drawing-
room, ready to depart, her opera cloak
covering her neck and shoulders, Lady
Julia had requested that she would remove
it, that she might see the effect of the new
ball dress; — Lady Julia, poor woman,
^always dreading to think how far she
might have reason to be shocked at the
too great exposure of those white shoul-
ders and beautiful bust.

This night the mother’s heart sank as she

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

213

gazed at the dicolletS state of her young
daughter; and she exclaimed in an accent
of dismay, “ Car, I will not go with you in
that state; I consider your dress indecently
low. Can anything be done to it ? If not,
you must change it for some other; and she
rang the bell and desired that Miss Evers-
field’s maid might be sent for.

A scene of most disagreeable altercation
ensued; Lady Julia, generally so passive,
was now determined and firm. She would
not allow her daughter to leave the house at-
tired in so unseemly, so immodest a manner.
After many angry and disrespectful words
addressed to her mother, tears of rage
coursing each other down her cheeks, she
was obliged to submit, whilst the maid drew
the dress over the exposed shoulders, and
with the aid of lace, endeavoured to veil the
charms so unrestrainedly exposed to the
public gaze.

The brow of the beauty was louring,
and the poor exhausted Lady Julia looked
paler and more careworn than ever when

they entered the splendid saloons of D----

House. The very first person they en-
countered was Lord Sinclair, in the act of
making his way through the crowd in order
to facilitate his escape, but, like a sunbeam
darting through the gloom of a sombre
cloud, a smile arrested his progress, and a
pair of eyes were fixed on him with an ex-
pression quite unusual, drawing the in-
fatuated man, like the needle to the load-
stone, to the fair one’s side.

“ You are late, Miss Eversfield,” were his
Lordship’s first words.

“ Yes,” she replied pensively, and in so
subdued a maimer to her usual sprightly,
off-hand address; “but 1 daresay you did
not miss me.”

“ Why should you think so ?” was eagerly
demanded.

“Because, lately, you have seemed to shun
me, Lord Sinclair; I can assure you I have
felt the difference in your manner,—I,
who really was so proud of your friend-
ship.”

“Miss Eversfield,” exclaimed Lord Sin-
clair, greatly moved, “ can you really mean
what you are saying, or is it only amusing
yourself at my expense ?—you know that you
are apt to do such things sometimes. Will
you dance this quadrille ? ” and he offered
his arm, which she immediately accepted;
and what happened during a long interval
which elapsed, Lady Julia had no means of
ascertaining, as her daughter never ap-
proached her, and the crowd was so great
that she. could not make her way for some
time into the dancing room, out of which
were conservatories and gardens illumined
by coloured lamps. But Car was busily
engaged; she achieved much business dur-

ing the time; drew from poor Lord Sinclair
a proposal of marriage, which she neither
accepted nor declined, but only begged for a
little time to consider such a serious step;
to-morrow she would give him an answer.
And now, having gained her point com-
pletely, she turned her thoughts into
another channel.

“ This will never do,” she cogitated; “ I am
not going to have a dull evening, and waste
my time in playing good and gentle by
that old man’s side (Lord Sinclair was only
thirty-three); there is poor Lawless half
dead with fury and jealousy; I really
must comfort and cheer him a little.”

“ "Will you take me to mamma?” she said,
demurely, as she rose from her seat.

They had been sitting in the garden,
and had entered the conservatory in order
to reach the house, when Car encountered
the gloomy young guardsman, who had

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

, 217

been hovering about, watching with terrific
glances the pair, and noting, with torturing
feelings, Lord Sinclair’s looks of love and
devotion, as he sat whispering into the ear
of his captivating companion. As Car
passed him she again put forth all the
artillery of her smiles and looks, seeing at
once the state of his mind; and whilst Lord
Sinclair turned away for a moment to speak
to a lady, she whispered—

“ What is the matter ?—are you not going
to ask me to dance to-night ? ”

Poor young man! in a moment what a
change was wrought by those looks, those '
words! With a sigh of thankfulness he
asked her to waltz, and Lord Sinclair was
civilly informed, though in sweet-sound-
ing words, that—“he might go about his
business.”

“ But I thought you wished to be taken
to Lady Julia ? ” he expostulated, not at all

relishing the idea of leaving her, to whom
he had plighted his faith, in the hands of
that young guardsman, whom he had dis-
liked and feared as a most dangerous rival.
But Car Eversfield little cared what he
might think; she had accomplished all she
wished; and what he thought or felt was
perfectly indifferent to her. The rest of
the evening was spent quite to her satisfac-
tion, conducting herself in a manner which
quiet, undemonstrative young ladies can
little imagine, and which would make the
uninitiated in such ways, wonder and
exclaim how such things could possibly be,
and how men, even the most satiated, who
do certainly admire, respect, and sometimes
worship modesty,—in their sober moments
desiring, above all other qualities, that spe-
cial one in their wife,—should be so com-
pletely enthralled, heart and soul, in the
allurements of a Delilah, for.it does seem,

to the inexperienced in the way of modern
society, antagonistic in the extreme. But
we will not for a moment desecrate the feel-
ing with which men regard these fast girls,
with the name of love; it has no affinity to
that more refined passion.

The conquered Lord Sinclair had to
make his way alone to Lady Julia, and
when by her side he told her what he had
done, that he had offered to her daughter
his hand, his heart.

For a moment the mother’s heart beat
high with joy. Such a marriage for her un-
promising child — such a man! just the one
to guide and guard one so young and
thoughtless; and she asked eagerly—

“ And has she accepted you ? ”

“ I could not induce Miss Eversfield to-
give me a decided^ answer; she begged I
would leave her till to-morrow to consider.
But, Lady Julia,” he asked anxiously, “ you

do not think I have any reason to fear a
refusal ? ”

Poor' Lady Julia in her sinking heart
felt that there was, indeed, great fear;
all she could say was, with much earnest-
ness and warmth,—

“ Oh, Lord Sinclair, if Car were to be
your wife, her lot, I feel, would be indeed a
most happy one.”

CHAPTER XVII.

Lady Julia was far too much exhausted,
when at length Car was caught and with
difficulty persuaded to return home, to be
able to enter upon the subject uppermost
in her thoughts, until she had recruited her
strength for what she might hear; and it
was late in the following afternoon before the
fair one, wearied also by her various exer-
tions of mind and body, had opened her eyes,
after the fatigues of the preceding night.

When at length she did appear before
her mother, then the tug of war commenced.

“ What an idiot the man is to have told
you anything about it I ” Car exclaimed, after

Digitized by LjOOQie
222 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

Lady Julia had spoken. “ He is only ex-
posing himself. I’m not going to marry him,
I can tell you, mamma,” she said. Lady
Julia’s heart sank.

“ "What can you then have meant, Car, by
the manner in which you encouraged him
last night ? I saw plainly that Lord Sinclair
was rather inclined to avoid you when we
first entered the room, and that you actually
forced yourself upon his notice.”

“I meant nothing at all but to have a
little amusement at his expense; he has
been showing me the cold shoulder lately —
and I will not bear that from any man,” the
girl said, defiantly. Lady Julia was speech-
less with dismay; with hands clasped to-
gether she sat, her eyes fixed upon her
daughter’s face, despair at her heart.

What was to become of this girl ? — what
terrible complication of evils would not her
conduct produce, not only to herself but to

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

223

all those belonging to her?—what would
be the end of all this ?

“ And you intend, then, to refuse Lord
Sinclair ? ” at length Lady Julia faltered.

“ I would just as soon marry old Thomp-
son, the butler,” Car replied. “ That dismal-
looking piece of propriety! a pretty slow life
I should have with him ! No, no, I thank
you, he is not at all of my sort; I have
brought him to his senses, and now I shall
wish him good morning.”

“ Very well, Car, then I desire you
will write his dismissal. I shall have nothing
to do with it,” Lady Julia resumed, with
grave displeasure. “ Your conduct has been
improper in the extreme. You have fallen
low, indeed, in my estimation. I pray that
none of your sisters may be in any one
respect like you.”

“ Oh, mamma, do you mean that I ought
to marry a man without feeling one atom of

Digitized by LjOOQie
224 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

love for him, just because he will be an earl
with an immense fortune? I thought you
would be the last person in the universe to
advocate such worldly views,—you, who are
always preaching duty and principle, and
all that sort of things.”

“ No, Car; what shocks and thoroughly
disgusts me in this case, is the shameful
conductyou have pursued towards that man,
so superior in every way to your own un-
worthy self; how completely you have lured
him on to commit himself by offering his
hand to you. I trust, much as I desire to see
you well married, that I am still quite in-
capable of asking or wishing any daughter
of mine to accept as a husband, a man,
however desirable, that she could not regard
with sufficient affection to enable her to
look forward, without shrinking, to be his
wife. No, Car, I watched you attentively
last night before you vanished for so long

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

225

from my sight with Lord Sinclair, and for
a few minutes my heart was filled with
pleasure; for I thought surely no girl could
look as you did, act as you did, and not
feel love towards the man whom she thus
looked upon.” Car laughed mockingly.

“ You did not before give me credit, I
suppose, for being such a good actress?
No, I do not care that" and she snapped
her fingers, “ for him, or his title, his for-
tune, or his worthiness: the latter musty,
fusty qualification, the last in the world to
be any recommendation to me.”

“ Well, I have quite done with you,”
Lady Julia indignantly rejoined. “ I shall
write to your father and tell him the
whole story; and, until his return, I shall
beg to decline everything in the shape of
going out. And now I will leave you to
compose your letter of dismissal to Lord
Sinclair, rejoicing, for his sake, that he has

escaped such a destiny as a future life with
you must surely have proved.”

Car began to cry; she saw before her
more difficulties than she had bargained
for. Her father’s displeasure, the only
thing on earth that ever touched her; and
then to be shut up like a nun in that dull
house with her mother, whom she never had
considered a lively companion; and such a
pleasant new flirtation she had just com-
menced, which she really found so pecu-
liarly agreeable and piquante; and, to crown
it all, to have a letter of so difficult a nature
to concoct to Lord Sinclair,—she, who was
such a bad hand at anything of the sort.

“ Oh, mamma,” she began, deprecatingly,
“ do pray help me, and just tell me what I
ought to say—you know I shall never be
able to do it—you always tell me that I do
not even spell properly; you do not wish
me to expose my ignorance, do you?”

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

227

“ I care not what you do,” Lady Julia
said, quite irritated into petulance, as she
left the room; “ only I beg you will write,
and not give me any further annoyance on
the subject.”

And the mother, with grief and anger at
her heart, left the presence of a daughter,
once so petted and idolised, but now sunk
so low in her estimation; one whom she con-
sidered so terrible a trial, standing at the
head of so large a family of sisters.

What a disadvantage must she prove to
those other four young creatures!

“ God grant that they may be kept from
following in her footsteps,” was the poor
woman’s inward cry, as she hastened to the
sanctuary of her own room, where, having
first locked her door, her anger melting into
sorrow, with tears streaming from her eyes,
she lifted up her heart in prayer, imploring
mercy for herself, her erring daughter, and

ft 2

for her other children’; beseeching that her
own sins might not be visited upon them.

And whilst thus laying bare her heart
to the great Searcher of Hearts, how fear-
fully acute became the remembrance of her
sins of omission and commission, especially
those which hinged most immediately upon
the present subject of her distress.

It is an awful, fearful retrospect for
parents to look faithfully and steadily back
upon their whole conduct as fathers or
mothers, commencing from the very begin-
ning of their children’s career; and, with
eyes cleared from the mist of partial blind-
ness, to trace, step by step, their own mis-
doings, their selfishness, indolence, vanity,
pride, cupidity,—all mingling in the bring-
ing up of their families; yes, and their
neglect of constant, earnest prayer for di-
rection in the course of the education and
advancing years of their sons and daughters;

dazzled as they too often are by those ad-
ventitious circumstances which are merely
earthly and carnal.

Many an affrighted, repentant parent has
seen the reflection of their own sins in a
child most fondly loved, and that sin by
degrees changing itself into a scorpion, to
wound the hand of one, whose whole heart
and soul has been engaged in administering
to the happiness of a child far more pre-
cious than life itself.

Yes, it is indeed a true and faithful
saying, that “the sins of the fathers are
visited upon the children.”

Cab, when left alone, gave way, as she
always did, to loud bewailings. When she
wept, it was with more violence than
grown-up persons in general think it at all
necessary to pour forth their woes; her
lamentations, like her laughter, were loud,
not deep.

“ How cross mamma is! ” she sobbed
forth. “ Oh! I wish I had any other
woman in the world for a mother; she
has become so prim and particular, never
letting one have a moment’s peace; and
she will write, and make out a pretty story

And not to be allowed to go out anywhere
till papa returns—I, who made an appoint-
ment with young Lawless to meet him this

And the brilliant Car now played the
part of a weeping Niobe. The door just
then opened.

“ If you please, my lady, the woman is
come about the children’s hats,” said Mrs.
Nelson, the nurse, looking round the room
in search of Lady Julia. “But what is
the matter, Miss Caroline ? ”

“ The matter ? plenty’s the matter. I am
the most miserable wretch in the world!”

And now Car flew to the nurse, and
throwing her arms round her, began afresh
her noisy moanings.

“Now, my dear, compose yourself,” was
the soothing answer. “ I daresay you have
been doing something to vex your mamma,
and you are sorry for it, and you ought to
be; for oh! Miss Car-------”

“Sorry for it!” cried the girl, starting
back, and looking fiercely at the nurse; “ I
am not sorry for that! I am the ill-treated
one; — yes, you may look as if you did not
believe me, but it is true, notwithstanding,
Madam nurse! ”

Mrs. Nelson still shook her head dis-
believingly. “ Your mamma never acts un-
kindly by any of her children, my dear.”

“ Will you just listen, you very wise old
woman, to what I am going to say, and an-
swer me truly ? Do you think it is kind of
a mother to be angry with a daughter for
not wishing to marry an ugly, dismal, cross

light of a sign-post than a man?”

“ That, I am sure, your mamma never
would do. I have not served her for nine-

pretty well; and I can vouch for her Lady-

that you would turn upon me like the rest.

“ I fear, Miss Car, that you are rather an
ungrateful girl, considering how many
friends you have, and all so inclined to be
kind to you. But I must go, for I have

is really cruel. Do you know she has de-
sired me to write a letter of refusal to this
man? and she will not assist me, and I can-
not do it. I write such bad letters, and he
is such a particular old prig. I do not like
to expose myself to him. He thinks me a
piece of perfection now, and I daresay
fancies I do everything well; and, Nelson, I
don’t know what to say. By the by, per-
haps you can help me?”

“I, Miss Car ? I don’t know how to refuse
gentlemen, particularly old men; I never did
such a thing in my life.”

“ Oh, Nelson,” said Car, now bursting out
into one of her merry laughs, though the
tears were still wet on her cheeks, “ I am
sure you have. Now just recollect; —was
there not a dismal, worthy old cheese-
monger on Holborn Hill, whom you refused
just before you came here to nurse me ? ”

“ Miss Caroline, Miss Caroline, what are

you dreaming about ? I refuse an old
cheesemonger! I don’t believe I ever spoke

in the way of business.”

“Well,” persisted Car, “ would not that
have been in the way of business, nursey ?
I am sure I think this offer of mine, business,
and a very bad business indeed. Now tell
me the truth, for it is of great importance
that I should know, what did you say to
the old gentleman ? ”

Mrs. Nelson looked quite alarmed.

“ My dear, what is the matter with you,
talking such nonsense? I never had an
offer from an old cheesemonger. If I had,
maybe I should have been, perhaps, too
glad to have accepted it,—I, at that moment
in such a poor plight, a widow with a baby,
no money, no friends, and no home, till I
was so blessed as to find home and friends

“ Yes, you were a sweet pretty baby,

still, though you do sadly vex me, I must
always continue to do so. But oh, my dear
child, you give me no end of heartaches, both
on your own account and all the others’.”

“ Oh, nursey,” said the girl, in a sweet
coaxing tone of voice, whilst she caressed
Mrs. Nelson, for, with all her grievous
faults, she could be, or seemed to be, affec-
tionate to those she loved, and her foster-
mother had, perhaps, as large a place in her
heart as any one save her father, “ I know
I am a naughty girl, but really I cannot
help it; I suppose it is my nature, and I am
doomed to be bad.”

the same a hundred times at least before.
And, really, you must assist me with this

would you have said if you did not choose
to have him ? ”

“But, Miss Caroline, I cannot suppose any
such stuff and nonsense, and don’t know
about anything of that sort. When my
poor husband asked me to marry him, and
he was the only person who ever did so, I
just said ‘ Yes,’ and there was an end of it.”

“Well, but you must assist me,” said
Car, sitting down to the writing-table and
preparing to write. “ Now I will begin,”
and she scrawled, “Beat Lord Sinclair.”

“ Lord Sinclair?” Mrs. Nelson exclaimed,

with dismay.

ought to be proud to marry; so rich and
noble too; and, what is better, who bears
such a character! Well,” she added, waxing
very wroth, “ I don’t wonder at your poor
mamma’s vexation; and you, whom I saw
riding in the park with him, he close by
your side,— and you making so much of
him. Oh, fie, fie, Miss Caroline!—I’ve no
patience any longer with you.”

And so saying, she hurried out of the

room; and when she had got rid of the
straw-hat woman, and put the baby to
sleep, she sat down to have a good cry.

“ Oh, that girl, that girl, she’ll break all
our hearts! ” was the burden of her song.

Car was thus left alone with her letter.
Many a blotted and smeared sheet was
scribbled over, tears of vexation dropping
upon the writing. At last the following
words were produced with the aid of a
dictionary:—

“ Dear Lord Sinclair,

“ I am very sorry, but I find on re-
flection that I cannot accept your kind
offer, though I feel very much obliged by
it. I really have no wish to marry. Pray
forgive me, if you think I have in any way
done wrong,

“ And believe me,

“ Truly yours,

“ Caroline Eversfield.”

With the deepest groan of relief, after
having read the common-place production
for the last time, she placed it in an enve-
lope, and then ringing the bell, desired the
servant to send it directly.

“Yes,” she murmured, “it shall go at
once, or there is no saying what may happen,
they all seem in such a state of frenzy upon
the subject. Heigho, what a bore all this
is! A pretty life I shall lead; quite enough
to make me cut my throat, and that poor
dear boy, Lawless, what will he do ? Oh,
Albert,” she sobbed forth, as her brother,
the very juvenile guardsman, entered the
room, “ I am so miserable.”

“What’s the row now?” inquired the
youth.

“ Oh, Albert, mamma is so ill-natured,
so unkind! I am to be shut up till papa
returns, just because I have refused to
marry that horrid Lord Sinclair.”

“ And more fool you! ” was the consoling
answer; “ the best match in London, and a
brick of a fellow into the bargain. I don’t
wonder mamma is angry.”

Again the noisy weeping commenced,
mingled with affronting, speeches aimed
at the offending brother. “ Everybody
against her! ” she cried, passionately and
vehemently; her brother, her mother, her
nurse, all alike!—including poor Lord Sin-
clair, were mingled in the general abuse.

Car was good-tempered enough in a
general way, her feelings were not suffici-
ently sensitive to cause her to be easily
touched — but rouse them by some unusual
means, and then a sudden blaze would flash
forth of fearful, startling, unfeminine signifi-
cance. Her brother, strong in the early
importance of his manhood, his profession,
his independence, cared little for this ebul-
lition, till words spoken disparagingly of his

he loved so dearly.

Then in his turn he became irritated
beyond control, ordered his sister to hold
her tongue, and not presume to speak thus
of her mother.

“ I see what you are at now,” he said,
“ you want to play the old game with Law-
less. I can only tell you, I for one am tho-
roughly ashamed of you and your ways; ”
and thus saying, he left the room, rushing
hurriedly upstairs to find Lady Julia, in
order to vent his anger against his sister,
and to assure her of his mighty protection
and preservation from the airs and im-
pertinence of that most odious and un-
manageable of girls.

CHAPTER XIX.

The London season was nearly over, and
the Eversfields were preparing to go into
the country. Sir Hector had lately come
into possession, by the death of his father,

of a place in A-----shire. The children,

governess, and nurses, with the exception
of Mrs. Nelson and the youngest boy, were
already despatched to Everslee; Lady
Julia and Sir Hector, with their eldest
daughter, having been long engaged to stay
at several country houses before returning
to their home.

Unfortunate Lady Julia! how she hated

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

245

the fatigue, expense, and gene of these visits!
and how she envied the young ones, and
longed to be included in the party, when
they set off so merrily on a fine summer’s
morning, leaving her so exhausted after her
troublous spring, alone with the restless
spirit Car!

Yes, let no mothers consider themselves
over-burthened by the troubles of nurseries
and school-rooms; rather let them sigh over
every discarded frock, and every tuck let
out in the dress of their girls; every change
from frock to jacket, jacket to tail-coat, in
their boys,—in fact, every sign and symbol
savouring of emancipation from the gentle
cares of their infancy.

It is really true that the bread-and-butter
time is the halcyon period of a mother’s
life; before the cup of almost unmixed
pride and pleasure in the possession of her
children, is mingled with anxieties impos-

And Lady Julia’s was a very divided
heart: with little ones to engross her
thoughts, and the requirements of those
who were growing up; their maturer
ages necessarily bringing forward graver
duties and responsibilities. How she
panted, as we have said, to be in the
country, for ever so short a breathing-time,
without the constant irritating anxiety of
poor Car! But it could not be; al-
though, indeed, Lady Julia was looking
so ill and worn that Nurse Nelson, as a
very privileged person in the establish-
ment did venture to say to the General—

“ Really, Sir Hector, my lady looks very
delicate; do not you think this visiting
about will be too much for her ? It would
have been better had she gone quietly into
the country with us.”

Sir Hector looked annoyed.

“ She does look ill, certainly, Nelson,”
he answered; “ but what am I to do about
Car ? She would not like to give up West-
over Castle, and all the other visits; and I
should be afraid to undertake the girl with-
out her mother. The fact is, I really cannot
manage that restless spirit; and, strange
to say, Lady Julia, gentle as she is, has
far more control over her daughter than I
have.’1

“ There’s the pity, Sir Hector. The fact
is, you have always spoilt Miss Car. Surely,
she is old enough, and ought to be wise
enough, to know how to conduct herself by
this time.”

Sir Hector only shrugged his shoulders
and shook his head, as much as to say,
“ But she is not.”

# * * *

It had been a stormy time since Car’s

refusal of Lord Sinclair. Her father, on
his return, had been seriously displeased;
her heartless conduct towards a man so su-
perior to herself in every way, her drawing
him on merely for the amusement of re-
fusing him, had filled him with disgust.

She had really been in disgrace with
every one. And the gentle Geraldine, who
was returning to her school in Paris, was
distressed to leave her usually joyous, over-
bearing sister,—always the first and fore-
most in the house, her voice and laughter
ringing on every ear,—for the first time in
her life, subdued and crest-fallen; her father,
even, scarcely noticing her.

Geraldine Eversfield was, indeed, the very
reverse of her elder sister in every respect.
No positive beauty characterised the pale
face and unpretending features of this
second Miss Eversfield; her appearance was
only distinguished by the amiability of her

expression and her gentle retiring manners.
How Lady Julia loved this young daughter,
who had been to her a constant source of
comfort and consolation, her right hand in
every matter in which she could assist her
mother; so kind to the little ones, so affec-
tionate and attentive to herself, not a sel-
fish feeling discernible in her nature ! But
she was growing fast towards the dreaded
period when she also must make her dibut
in the gay world, and Lady Julia thought
with deep distress of her sister’s hitherto
objectionable career; not that she doubted
her gentle child, but it had really come to
this state of things, that, under the present
circumstances, it would be disadvantageous
to the girl to see such glaring examples of
want of retenue constantly before her eyes,
and to hear so much that was unfit for the
innocent Geraldine’s ears.

When the General, after leaving Geral-

Digitized by LjOOQie

dine, returned from Paris, he found his
wife certainly in no state to accompany him
to the gay country house, where every kind
of festivity was to take place, and where she
must dress and exert herself from morning
till night.

Car had been unusually subdued and
quiet during the General's absence; she
had been in some degree sobered by the
disgrace into which she had fallen. Mrs.
Nelson had spoken kindly, but severely, to
her; and no one exercised so much in-
fluence over the wayward girl as her foster-
mother, who was a sensible, superior woman,
loving her nursling with the most maternal
affection,—every word she uttered coming
straight from her tender, honest heart.

“Oh! to think you were once such a
sweet, innocent little baby!” she would
sometimes exclaim.

“ And what am I now, nurse ? ” Car asked

one day as she sat at her feet, disconsolately
leaning her head upon her knee.

“ What are you ? Oh, Miss Car, you know
well enough what you are,” was the response.

“ Yes, tell me the truth ; you may just let
it all out, and abuse me right and left as
you please.”

“ Oh, my child, I don’t want to abuse you,
I am sure; you know I would give my right
hand to do you good — to make you what
you ought to be—a comfort to your dear
papa and mamma, instead of seeing you,
whom we used to be proud as well as fond
of, only a trouble and distress to them;
and oh, Miss Caroline, your poor dear
mamma--------”

“ What of her ? ” exclaimed Car, suddenly
raising her face.

“ WTiat of her, child ? ” answered the

where the baby lay.

“ Alone; no, my place has been filled all

that conceited chit, Albert, who takes upon
himself all the airs and graces of a man;
even presumes to lecture me. It is all very
fine parents’ talking about having no favou-
rites ; I am sure that is not the case with
mine; for instance, Geraldine and Albert,
— mamma does not consider me worthy to
be called their sister.”

“ Oh, fie, fie, Miss Caroline! ” reproved the
nurse.

“ Yes, it is quite true, Nelson,” was
the indignant rejoinder; “ and I can tell you
that several times to-day I went into

young brother of mine, looking daggers at

him — affected fellow!—holding mamma’s

“ Dear boy! ” exclaimed Mrs. Nelson,
“just like him; he always was a tender-
hearted child — so fond of his mamma.”

“ A stupid milksop! — not like a man,”
Car persisted, waxing ireful.

“ I beg your pardon, Miss Caroline,” inter-
rupted the nurse, indignantly; “ I have lived
many years longer in the world than you
can count, and of one thing I am quite sure,
that the bravest and the best of men have
always been those who have the softest
hearts towards their mothers, and, indeed,
towards all who are weaker than themselves,

particularly their own mothers. Yes, dear
boy!—you will see that he is no milksop, but
a true son of his father; and when he is called
upon to show his manhood, he will prove as
fearless a soldier, as noble a man, as the
General has been before him. Mr. Albert
a milksop, indeed! ”

“ Oh, yes, youcan take everybody’s part
but mine. I, of course, am the black sheep of
the family, just because I have good spirits
and enjoy fun, and because I do not choose
to marry a prig of a man I could never like.
Who would expect me, young as I am, to
turn into a demure grand lady, and play at
propriety till I became a dried-up mummy,
no longer the merry, light-hearted Car
Eversfield ? No, Madam Nelson, in spite of
all the gloomy looks and cold words which
are for ever cast upon me from every direc-
tion, I can just tell you ,/or once and for ever,
that I intend to enjoy life whilst I can. I am
sorry to see mamma look ill, and I am still

for really, I am very fond of the dear old

“ Oh, Miss Caroline, Miss Caroline! ”
groaned the nurse, raising her hands in
horror.

“ Yes,—don’t interrupt me, you old goose!
—and, to finish what I was saying, in spite of
everything bothering, — and they do worry
me past endurance, — I intend to take my
own way; depend upon it, I shall do very
well and take good care of myself. Lord
Sinclair will keep, — he will do very well for

to alter me. No, it’s just lost labour to en-
deavour to make a good woman of me. By

which it had been resting, she saw that tears
were coursing one another down the cheeks

started the wayward girl, her arms were flung
round the good woman’s neck, and covering

for earnest,” as Mrs. Nelson endeavoured to
disengage herself from Car’s embrace. “ I
am only in fun.”

“ Such things are inexcusable to say even
in fun; such light talk amounts, indeed, to
downright wickedness,” was Mrs. Nelson’s
remark, as, rising to go to the child who was
now awake and crying, she determinately
extricated herself from Car’s pertinacious
caresses, and walked, with sternness upon
her brow, to the crib at the other side of the
room.

CHAPTER XX.

Lady Julia, as well as the baby, became too
ill for her to think of putting the visiting plan
into execution. The medical man decidedly
forbade it. “All that her Ladyship can do,”
he said, “ is to go quietly into the country,
and there remain and take care of herself,
for she is in a very exhausted state; and as
for the child,” and he shrugged his shoulders,
“ Mrs. Nelson will be able to manage him.
I fear he will be a delicate plant to rear.”

Sir Hector would most gladly have given
up all these visits and accompanied his
wife to Everslee, but Lady Julia implored
him, at least, to take Car to Westover
Castle.

VOL. i.	s

“ It will be a dreadful disappointment to
her,” she urged ; “and Lady Westover will,
I am sure, look after her in some measure.
Lady Millicent, though a lively girl, has not,
I think, any guile in her; and, dear Hector,”
the invalid added sadly, “I believe her
absence, poor child, will be beneficial to me.
I require repose of mind, which I cannot
have whilst she is with me. It is very sad,
very dreadful, to be obliged to say anything
so harsh of one’s own daughter, but it has
come to this at last. I suppose it is my
state of health that renders me thus sensi-
tive, but I live in constant terror of that
girl doing something to annoy me; and my
nerves are so irritable that, no doubt, I
magnify everything she says and does, far
beyond what really is meant. It will be
better for her, as well as for me, that we
should be separated for a short time.”

Sir Hector acquiesced, as he generally did,

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

259

in every wish of his wife’s, and it was
settled that, as soon as Lady Julia was strong
enough to travel, she should proceed to
Everslee, and Car and himself to Westover
Castle; these projects, however, did not take
place till the second week in August.

Car received this intelligence, given to
her by the General, with inward exultation:
it was just what she wanted. However, she
restrained all demonstration of satisfaction,
and listened very demurely whilst her
father severely admonished her as to what
her conduct must be whilst under his sole
charge.

He certainly had been far less indulgent
lately towards this daughter, whom he really
so fondly loved, not being able to forgive
the trouble and distress she was constantly
causing her mother. The General was ever
endeavouring to be austere and cold in his
manner towards this hitherto petted girl, but
• 2

Digitized by LjOOQie
260

PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

the attempt generally proved a failure;—Car
knew too well how to manage him.

A well-timed flood of tears — stopping
with the tenderest kisses the mouth from
which was about to proceed words of severe
import—soon defeated the General; but still
his grave, sad countenance, though it soft-
ened under her resistless influence, did not
now beam upon her with its wonted bright-
ness.

His heart was heavy, both on her account
and that of his wife. But still he thought,
“ Poor girl, what is to be done about her I
do not know; perhaps when she is older her
wild ways will tame down. I cannot be-
lieve that there is any real harm in her;
and lately, how much more quiet she has
been! Certainly, her manner has been more
subdued, and she would, I am sure, be atten-
tive to her mother, if my dear wife would
allow her to be more with her; but the very
presence of the girl seems to agitate her, and

to bring that flush of weakness into her
face; and, certainly, Car is wonderfully awk-
ward in a sick-room. It is extraordinary
to see the difference between her and
Albert in that respect; he, so gentle
and handy; she always coming in like a
whirlwind, upsetting everything before her,
speaking in her usual tone of voice, not re-
membering that, even her clear musical
tones are all too loud for the sensitive ear
of an invalid; and yet,” and the father
sighed painfully, “ with all her faults she is
really such a pet of mine.”

We are not to imagine that the dull
weeks that elapsed before Car Eversfield
left London were passed without excite-
ment and amusement to herself. No! —
although evening gaieties were at an end,
she was playing a game which answered
every purpose pour le moment.

She must have walking exercise, she

piteously told her father; and, of course, she
could not take it during the later part of the
day, now the governess and her sisters were
away, and he was so very busy;—so she
proposed that she should get up very early
and walk in the park with Louise, her French
maid — nobody could object to that, she
thought.

And the General, thinking no evil, let
her go.

Our readers may wonder how this
young lady managed to eke out the very
lengthened time which passed before she
returned every morning, looking so bright
and fresh from her walk, to join her father
at breakfast.

“Well, indeed, Miss Car, you have cer-
tainly turned over a new leaf—you who used
to be the last to appear downstairs. Where
have you been walking this morning?” the
General remarked, as he looked at his bloom-
ing daughter.

“ Oh, papa, I generally contrive to get
into Kensington Gardens; I have a friend
there, one of the gardeners; — I gave him
half-a-crown, and I am always admitted, even
before the usual hour for opening the gates.
It is so delicious to sit under the trees with
a book!”

Yes, Caroline did go to Kensington
Gardens every morning, and there she
lingered till the time warned her that ten
o’clock was near at hand, and she must be
at home to appear before her father at the
breakfast-table.

Her home was close at hand, in one of the
houses overlooking the park, in Bayswater,
so it took but a few minutes to return.
And was it only with a book that Car sat
under the shade of one of those beautiful
trees?

The book might be there indeed—some
French novel Mam’selle Louise had contrived

S 4

Digitized by LjOOQie
264 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

to obtain for her —but it was seldom even
opened at that time. One sat by her who
required every glance of those bright eyes
to be cast upon himself alone.

Yes! —there might be seen, close beside
her, the tall, handsome young Lawless, drink*
ingin rich draughts of passionate love, as he
gazed on his beautiful companion, that arch
deceiver, who, without the slightest com-
punction, merely for her own amusement
and to while away the tedium of her present
existence, was driving the impetuous youth
into a whirlpool, a dizzy round, too likely
at last to precipitate him into destruction.

It was a picture a Watteau might have
coveted for a subject, to behold those two
young beings seated there in that beautiful
spot beneath one of those unbrageous trees,
the glory of all Londoners; the brilliant
morning’s summer sun softly tinting
with its rays all around, shining upon the

265

water, brightening the colour of the foliage,
and bringing forth from the dewy turf the
fragrant odours of vegetation.

Yes, there they sat; the girl with her
straw hat removed and thrown carelessly at
her feet, displaying fully that bewitching
face—bewitchingly dangerous indeed!—her
light muslin dress, so gracefully draping
her faultless form, her eyes so varying in
expression, now lifted up, animated with
lively glee, and then again assuming an
aspect of languid softness, still more danger-
ous to the unfortunate who gazed into their
very depths with earnestness amounting to
agony.

And the young man, what a fine speci-
men he was of an Englishman in early
youth! or rather, we ought to say, one bred
up in England, for the blood of our sister
countries flowed in his veins,—his Irish
nature no doubt preponderating, if we may

Digitized by LjOOQie
266 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

judge by the rash impulsive feelings which
characterised his every action.

But he was quite the man to lay hold of
the heart of an unsophisticated girl—a
hero of romance, we might have supposed, to
all soft maidens’ hearts. And Car Eversfield
did think him very handsome, and liked to
meet him, to look at him, to talk to him, to
hear him pour forth his whole soul to her; in-
deed, even her unimpressible heart throbbed
often wildly whilst under the spell of his
gaze. It excited her not a little, and
flattered too her vanity,—sent her homewith
many feelings, brightening her countenance:
but not one atom of genuine bond fide love
was mingled in these sensations.

“ It is very pleasant to meet the hand-
some fellow,” she would soliloquise, “ and
I like it very much, and must go on with
it whilst I am thus moped up, for I should
die of the dumps if I did not have this

little amusement; but, upon my word,
I bad better take care, for I cannot marry
him. I know perfectly that I should soon
get dead sick of him, in spite of his hand-
some face. And,” she continued, “the
more I think of it, the more certain am I
that I could not marry; that is to say, if I
am expected to behave myself afterwards;
but this boy—for I can scarcely fancy him
a man, he looks so fair and young—will insist
upon talking of marriage, and how I shall be
able to say a final ‘ No,’ I cannot imagine.
I wish, to goodness, mamma were well
enough to go to Everslee, and that Papa
and I were off to Westover Castle; we
shall miss the Brookwood races for a cer-
tainty, mid I shall go mad with spite.”

And thus it went on for some time, till
at length one morning might have been
seen under those same trees, another picture,
which might well have served for a pendant

life, no village girl and rural Strephon.

This was their last interview under the
trees in Kensington Gardens, for Car was
to leave London the next day with her
father for Westover Castle.

“ Miss Eversfield! —beautiful Caroline! ”
exclaimed the enamoured youth, as she
rose to depart, “ for the hundredth time I
implore you to give me a final answer—
may I hope to call you my own?—my
wife ? ”

“Oh, Norman Lawless,” she petulantly
replied, “ why will you continue to torment
me by that ceaseless question?—I have told
you a thousand times that I have no inten-
tion of marrying at present.”

“And do you then not love me?” he
vehemently cried. “ And after all that has

passed between us, Caroline, do you think
I can exist, after these weeks of bliss, these
daily meetings, all those joyful moments
in which I have felt so blest—judging by
your looks, your words, that our love was
mutual—now to be thus discarded, without
one hope left, upon which to exist! ”

And with almost abject entreaty, this
young man, so strong in frame, so generally
undaunted in the fierce expression of his
handsome countenance, cowered beneath
the influence of that young girl, whilst he
seized her hands, imploring her not to leave
him thus in despairing wretchedness.

Car really felt rather sorry for him, as
she turned her head away, whilst the young
lover still held her hands; but even in that
brief moment the old ideas floated through
her mind.

“ What am I to do ? If I say I will marry
him, it is all up with me ; in no time I

Digitized by LjOOQie
270 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

shall be chained for life, and all ray fan
over. Bat I do like him; and I have not
the heart quite to dash his hopes for ever;
and I certainly have given him an awful
deal of encouragement.”

And the thought of how much it had
really been, made her cheek, even, bum with
blushes.

“Well, Caroline,” again spoke Lawless,
“ why this silence ?—have you no word of
hope to give me ? ”

Again the girl paused, and thus she
thought, as now she struggled to extricate
her hands freon his firm grasp —

“I suppose that I cannot get off; oh,
what a fool I have been! but I will not
speak the decisive word—no, I cannot.”

“ I will not let you go until you decide
my fate,” Lawless said, now sternly, his
countenance assuming its natural expres-
sion of defiance; am I to believe that, after

Digitized by LjOOQie

all that has passed between us, you mean
positively to refuse me ? ”

“Oh, no, no, Lawless!” Car answered,
beginning to feel rather frightened, “ only

wait a very short time, and then------”

“ You will accept me for your husband?”
Lawless interrupted. “ Answer this simple
question ere we part.”

“We shall meet at Brookwood, and there
all shall be settled.”

And Car turned upon her agitated and
now incensed lover, one of those glances
which she knew were all-conquering; and
the parting was in no ways like that of
lovers with hearts so totally dissimilar;
— one, with all its faults, true to the
passionate love which filled it; the other,
void of every feeling save that of self-
indulgence, vanity, and the momentary

gratification of its senses.

Snt Hector and his daughter went to
Westover,— he, poor man, low and de-

the same morning, with the sick child still
much of an invalid, and also dreading the
task he had imposed upon himself, that of
being his troublesome Car’s sole guardian
during their visit to this gay country
house.

She was in mad spirits, much to the
disgust of Mrs. Nelson, who, full of sorrow-
ful forebodings, both for her lady and the
child, was busy packing, when Car as usual
bounced into the nursery.

“ Well, old woman, so we shall be off at
last, and hurrah! I say. But I should like
to know why I am to have that formal old
maid Fenton to go with me instead of
Louise ? She does not understand dressing
my hair half as well, and, besides, I have a
personal dislike to her. I suppose, therefore,
she is to be in the capacity of keeper.”

“Perhaps so, Miss Caroline,” was the
answer.

“You may as well advise her not to
meddle with me; or, just to torment the
piece of propriety, I’ll lead her a pretty
dance. I don’t much care, only it is a bore,

staying in a large country-house. She tells
one a little of everything, and poor little
creature, she is so disappointed.”

“ No doubt, Miss Caroline,” was the su-
percilious reply.

“ Oh, I see you are in a bad humour, and
no mistake, Madam Nelson.”

“ I am in a very sorrowful humour, Miss
Eversfield, and I wonder you are quite so
gay when your mamma is so ill, and the
poor baby in such a failing state. Doc-
tor L. thinks he cannot be reared.”

Car looked a little grave.

“I am very sorry, Nursey,” she said,
“ but I hope country air will do them both
good. Doctor L. always croaks. I daresay
little Henry will live to be as great a bully
as any of the rest.”

The nurse shook her head.

“ I hope, my dear, you will not add to

your mamma’s troubles by vexing her by
your conduct. Pray be steady while you
are away; your poor papa, I can tell you, is
quite nervous at the idea of having the sole
charge of you.”

Car burst into one of her fits of laughter.

“ Upon my word, it amuses me. I believe
I am considered in the light of some wild
animal in a menagerie, which terrifies every
one, even its keepers; but I tell you what)
—for the sake of the timid souls about me,
I really think I will marry after all, and rid
them of the plague of me.”

“ Oh, don’t think, my dear, they want you
to marry merely to get rid of you! No,
indeed, you misjudge the best of parents;
but should you meet with a husband with
whom you could live happily,— and Miss
Car,” Nelson added severely, “ respectably,
it would be best for all parties.”

“ Respectably! Ha! ha! Oh, Nursey,

that is quite in your cheesemonger’s line.
Respectably! — I hardly know the meaning
of the word.”

“ Oh, I will tell you what it is, Miss
Caroline. Respectably means ”—

“ Oh, hold your tongue, you most tire-
some of old creatures,” cried Car, putting
both her hands to her ears. “ I don’t want
to hear you prose about what I shall never
be, nor ever wish to be.”

Mrs. Nelson turned up her eyes and shook
her head, sighing hopelessly.

“ If I marry,” the girl continued, “ it will
not, I can tell you, be to please myself. I
shall hate and detest selling myself just to
please others, and upon my word, I don’t
think, when it comes to the scratch, I shall
ever be able to do it. So good night, you
crossest of the cross!”

And now Caroline found herself at length
on the road to Westover Castle. It saddened

T 3

her father still more as he, with his heavy
heart, travelled with her into Sussex, that
not a trace of feeling did she evince at hav-
ing just parted from her mother and the
little brother, whose death-like countenance
gave little hope of final recovery.

Albert, the boy guardsman, had taken a
daughter’s place towards his mother, and
obtained a short leave of absence to escort
her to Everslee, and it was with real com-
fort the General placed his wife under his
charge.

The father, whollyabsorbed in meditation,
scarcely looked at or heeded his daughter,
for some time after they were seated in the
railway carriage, nor had he remarked that,
whilst on the platform of the terminus, she
had her own business to transact.

In a sharp tone of voice, Car said to the
grave-looking maid, who, according to in-
structions given to her from home, was
standing close to her side,

Digitized by LjOOQie
A PAST YOUNG LADY.

“ Fenton, in the name of patience, why
don’t you go and look after the luggage; in
all this confusion, that stupid Thomas will
be sure to make some blunder. I shall
not at all like to have no dress to-night for
dinner, in consequence of my trunk having
been put into some wrong place; and besides,
I don’t want you to stand here guarding
me, as if I were a child, or an idiot.”

Fenton was obliged to obey. And as she
departed a young officer rapidly advanced.
“I could not resist coming here to have
one more glimpse of you, Caroline,” he ex-
claimed in an agitated tone of voice, “ and
again to remind you of your promise; re-
member, at the Brookwood races I am to
have your final answer, and oh! for mercy’s
sake, let it be a favourable one, dearest
Caroline.” And her hand was seized and
pressed with genuine fervour.

“ Yes, yes,” she hastily replied, every

Digitized by LjOOQie
280 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

moment expecting her father’s return.
“ But, Mr. Lawless, I must tell you, it will
not be given till the last day of the races;
I have a particular reason that so it shall
be.” “ Yes,” she thought, “ let me put it off
till the very last moment, and enjoy myself
whilst I may.”

“ You are as cruel as you are beautiful,”
the young man replied, as he gazed on the
dazzling face before him.

“ This is my final resolve, however,” Car
added pettishly, “ and now pray go. I see
my father coming.”

Lawless stepped aside, and soon he beheld
his insidious charmer whirling off rapidly
from his sight. She had with mocking
kindness put her head out of the window,
in order that the unfortunate youth might
carry away with him still more of the subtle
poison derived from the destroying passion,
which was undermining every healthful
spring of his soul.

How brilliant was the countenance of
the girl, when Sir Hector at last looked
upon her! the face so flushed, heightening
the carnation on her cheek, her eyes flash-
ing with an expression which the father’s
heart trembled to observe.

Now it was not that of the careless light-
hearted glee with which they were wont to
sparkle so merrily; no, it seemed to him, that
some fiercer feeling than usual was agitating
her mind. There was a smile upon her lips,
but it was one which partook of scorn and
defiance, assimilating with the expression
of the lustrous eyes.

“ Car, what are you thinking about? ”
the General at length asked, after he had
contemplated his daughter for a brief
space.

Car started, and then blushed crimson.
“ Thinking of, Papa,” she said, “ thinking
of? Why, a thousand things. Why do you
want to know ? ”

“ Only because I have been watching your
countenance, and I never before remember
seeing it look as it has done for the last ten
minutes. My madcap Car seemed to be
coming out in quite a new character; instead
of a light-hearted, thoughtless Bacchante,
you looked as if you were for the first time
in your life reflecting seriously, and upon
no peaceful subject, most certainly.”

Car laughed her usual light laugh. “ Pray
Papa don’t liken me to a Bacchante, it
sounds so very horrible. I who never drink
any wine but champagne, when I can get
it; it just shows what a bad opinion you
must have of my looks and tastes. A
Bacchante indeed! ”

The General laughed. “ Well Car, what
was it that transformed you at that moment
into a fierce Gulnare? A penny for your
thoughts, my child.”

“ I was thinking that I must, as Nelson
says, ‘ turn over a new leaf,’ and give up

enacting the Bacchante, as you call me!
Heigho! it will be a great bore, for I have
had such fun.”

No more could be said upon the subject,
as they had just stopped at a station, and
passengers wpre climbing into the carriage,
some of whom proved to be acquaintances,
who were also en route for Westover
Castle.

With what light-hearted glee Car Evers-
field jumped out of the carriage which had
met them at the station, when it stopped
before the door of the stately mansion!

In the hall she was informed that Lady
Millicent requested that Miss Eversfield
should be at once conducted to her Ladyship’s
dressing room, as she had just returned
from a long ride. And away went Car,
flying up the wide staircase, pursued more
leisurely by the groom of the chambers, who
could imagine no possible reason for such
unwonted haste.

And soon noisy greetings resounded
through the pretty sanctum of Lady Milli-
cent.

“Oh! Milly, how glad I am to find
myself here at last! ” Car exclaimed, as
she hugged and kissed her Jfriend, who,
having just thrown off her riding-habit,
had replaced it by a dressing-gown, — her
hair tucked under a net displaying a face
not very handsome, but with bold good-
nature in its expression. With reciprocal
warmth she welcomed her favourite gossip,
Car Eversfield.

“ Such a time I have had of it since I
saw you, darling Milly!” Car continued,
trying to look doleful.

“ Yes, dear—but Car, you wicked one, did
you not contrive to amuse yourself not-
withstanding ? However, first have some
tea to refresh you, and then we will talk
thirteen to the dozen, as the bakers say.

Of time, and Mamselle Louise need not hurry
her unpacking.”

“ Louise, poor Louise, she is not here,” was
the response, made in a tone of querulous
dissatisfaction, “ that is just one specimen of
the manner in which I am worried. No, for-
sooth!—she was not thought steady enough
to be my keeper! Poor little soul, I left her
sobbing her heart out with disappointment.
That grim old maid of mamma’s, whom I
never could endure, has been sent with me,
no doubt with all sorts of injunctions to
watch me narrowly. I’ll try to lead her a
dance, and drive her half-mad- if possible.”

“ And no doubt you will succeed, you in-
corrigible creature,” laughed Lady Millicent;
but you may give her rest just for one night,
for we shall be quite alone to-day, excepting
the few dull people you met in the train.
Our party does not begin till to-morrow,
and then, Car, we shall have some of all
sorts for you to try your flirting manoeuvres

upon. Who of all men in the world do you
think is coming ? ”

“Not Lord Sinclair, I hope, or Norman
Lawless. I really must have a little rest from
them?” Car demanded eagerly and in real
alarm.

“ Oh no, but the hero you have so long
been expiring to know. For some reason
or another papa could not help inviting him,
for mamma has been hot against it. People
are beginning to think it is not the proper
thiog to ask him into their houses. At a
dinner party in London, it does not much
signify, but the intimate association of a
country house is considered deteriorating
to the morals of us innocent maidens.”

“Oh, I know whom, you mean,” exclaimed
Car with brightening eyes, “ it is that man so
all-powerful in every way, that all-conquer-
ing hero, both as a warrior and a lady-
killer—that delightful wicked one, Lord
Glendinnon.”

“ Yes, Car, so I advise you to take care.
Mamma will look sharp after you, I must
warn you; Lady Julia has placed you as
solemnly in her hands as if--”

“ Oh please don’t talk of mamma’s absur-
dities!” exclaimed the undutiful daughter;
“upon my word,’’she continued, her eyes now
sparkling with anger, “ they will drive me
into doing something outrageous, by making
mountains into mole-hills, talking of me in
that manner to people; but, Milly,” and her
countenance again changed, “ I really have
got into a scrape, and how to get out of it
without getting deeper than ever into the
mire, I have no idea.”

“What’s the matter now?” Lady Millicent
inquired.

“Well, you see, for the last month
London has been detestable to me; I have
been a regular prisoner—mamma so ill,
and papa both grumpy and out of spirits—
I should have regularly died of it had it not

been for a little diversion I got up with
young Lawless. You know, my dear, that
when men once take to smoking they can’t
live without their cigar. It is the same with
flirting,—if a girl ever takes to flirting
she cannot exist without it, it becomes meat
and drink to the unfortunate individual; and
the fact is, in my weariness and want of any-
thing else to do, just in the same way as
a man would treble his number of cigars
when suffering under a fit of ennui, I in-
dulged in an unusual fit of flirting.”

“ Under those circumstances it must have
been indeed something tremendous,” said
Lady Millicent laughing, “considering what
I have already witnessed.”

“It was tremendous,” Car continued
solemnly, “ and I own to being a great fool
to have gone as far as I did, for I really be-
lieve, darling,” and she began to whimper,
“ that I shall be obliged after all to marry

that tiresome man, for I have all but pro-
mised to do the horrible thing ; and how to
get out of the scrape I cannot imagine, for I
have discovered that he is one who will
stand no nonsense, and 1 have been — so
foolish.”

“Well, never mind, Car,” was the consol-
ing rejoinder, “ the deed must be done some
time or another, and Lawless is really a
handsome fellow, and an excellent parti;
and because you are married, I suppose you
need not be miserable. Look at the young
married women in London—they are far
more jolly and happy than we spinsters; I
believe life only begins when women marry
well (and I mean by marrying well, position
and money of course), and the husband is a
sensible man who lets his wife take her own
course, and he his own, and does not trouble
her by too exigeant affection.”

“ Oh, hut, Milly, fancy the troublesome

lasting babies. I believe she was once up*
on a time beautiful, and now how wan and
faded she looks! The idea of running one’s
head into a chance of such a horrible fate
makes me shudder. And after all, I believe I
do possess some very, very faint glimmering
of a conscience, for knowing myself so per-
fectly as I do, and having had well dinned
in my ears many virtuous precepts, I
think perhaps I had better wait till I am

feel convinced that I should weary of that
youth in a week, and then a pretty life for

him too much to wish him such a misfortune

“ Ah! but you are far wiser than I am,”
sighed Car.

“ Perhaps so, and perhaps not quite so
cold-blooded as you, fair Caroline,” Lady
Millicent replied, “and my advice to you,
Car, is to give up some of your very
foolish ways, and ‘ strike while the iron’s
hot.’ You were a goose to lose an ex-
cellent chance in Lord Sinclair; but young
Lawless is quite another thing; with all that
hot Irish blood in his veins, he is charming
and original. Heigho! I wish he had taken
a fancy to me.”

“ Do you really?” Car asked, rather im-
pressed by her friend’s words.

“ Yes I do, although I warn you that he
is not really quite the man he generally
appears. One would imagine him a careless,
joyous, lighthearted being, every quality of
his mind appearing on the surface. But
you know I am a bit of a physiognomist
and phrenologist, and I have studied both

in him as well as I was able without mani-
pulating his head, and of one thing I am
perfectly sure, that he will be an awkward
customer to deal with, if thwarted. His
bump of firmness rises conspicuously even
amidst those clustering curls, and this, with
but a small amount of conscientiousness and
a preponderance of the basilar regions, as
they are phrenologically termed, is not
likely to render him a very easy subject to
manage.”

Car put her hands to her ears.

“ Oh, Milly, don’t talk in that incompre-
hensible manner; I don’t care anything
about phrenology—that hard name is as
much as I can pronounce—as for under-
standing anything about it, I might just as
well try to speak Hebrew. Norman Law-

“ Oh, Car, what a little goose you are! I

too,” placing her hand on the small head,
and then she added, “and the absence of

The dressing-bell rang.

“ Oh, good gracious!” cried Car, starting
up, “that reminds me of horrid Fenton.

CHAPTER XXII.

Lady Millicent, when she had finished her
toilette, repaired to Car’s room to escort her
down stairs.

What a scene of confusion met her eyes!
The young lady had evidently carried out
in full her intention of worrying the poor
lady’s maid. The contents of every drawer
seemed to have been ruthlessly ransacked,
and their contents flung upon the floor; the
bed was covered with artificial flowers,
wreaths, and bouquets of all hues and kinds,
and now Car was vehemently gesticulating,
whilst the poor woman, with a heated face
and trembling hands, was lacing up the
tight-fitting bodice of the impatient girl.

“ Oh, Millicent, I dare say I am late, but
it is not my fault; how can I possibly dress
with a maid who knows nothing on earth
about my ways? I never wear artificial
flowers when I am in the country; Louise
always makes me the loveliest things for my
head; the idea of asking me to put on one of
these horrid things! ”

“I had not time, you know, to-day, to
make up anything, Miss Eversfield. To-
morrow you shall have a wreath,” replied
Fenton.

“ You make up a wreath! Thank you, I
would rather be excused wearing anything
of your making.”

“ I made many of those you used to wear,
Miss. When Louise was busy I generally
made them.”

“ I am sure your hair is perfectly done
to-night, Car; such beautifully smooth thick
rolls.”

“ They have, however, been down several

times already I can tell you, and I dare
say, at dinner you will see one of them fall
and drop into my neighbour’s soup. My
hair feels so loose and uncomfortable. Now
give me my gloves, and pocket-handkerchief,
and be quick; don’t you see Lady Millicent
is waiting ? ”

And away she flounced, and as soon as
the door was closed began to laugh.

“ Now haven’t I paid her off properly?
She’ll think it no treat to come out visiting
with me another time.”

“ No, I should think not indeed,” replied
Lady Millicent; “ I must say I pity the poor
woman from the bottom of my heart.”

Car continued to laugh until they entered
the grand saloon where the company had
assembled for dinner. She immediately
went up to Lady Westover, whom she had
not yet seen, and who greeted her affection-
ately, and then she turned to seek Lord
Westover, whom in the absence of more at-

Digitized by LjOOQie

tractive sports she did not at all object to
flirt with, and he, notwithstanding his sixty
years and more, was always delighted to be
even second best with the beautiful Caro-
line, whose charms he most fully appre-
ciated.

He was standing at some distance, talking
to a tall man, whose back was turned
towards her. Car was instantly struck by
the appearance of the stranger, though
even thus imperfectly seen. He could
not be any one of those guests Millicent
had enumerated.

She however fearlessly advanced, longing
to see the face of this stately, imposing-
looking figure, and said,

“ Lord Westover, you have not yet spoken
to me.” His Lordship was most tender in
his welcome to his fair guest.

Depend upon it, the older a man becomes,
the greater his admiration for youthful

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

301

beauties increases ; at least so we have
generally observed.

Lord Westover had taken possession of
both the fair hands that were held out to
him, and gazed with undisguised delight
upon the bright face which looked up to
his with such flattering empressement.

But Car, whilst she thus was apparently
engrossed by hey noble host, had managed
also to cast her eyes upon the object of her
curiosity, the tall man, who still stood dose
behind them.

Never did she appear to more advantage,
for although her dress was only white mus-
lin, enlivened by a gold band round her
waist, it fitted exquisitely, displaying her
beautiful figure to the fullest perfection,
and her simple coiffure, glossy luxuriant
hair, unencumbered by flowers, or any of
the superfluous ornaments with which
young ladies will disfigure themsdves,

allowed the beholder to feast his eyes upon
the statue-like shape and proportion of the
small undecorated head.

And Car was at that moment thoroughly
pleased, and that alone gave an additional.
charm to her face.

She saw in a moment that the stranger
was gazing upon her with unmistakable
admiration, and she had also instantly re-
cognised his identity. He was the far-
famed Lord Glendinnon — far-famed in
many ways, besides being a military man
of the highest reputation.

Having listened to many pretty compli-
mentary speeches from Lord Westover,
addressed to the now blushing girl, whose
heart was already fluttering under the gaze
of this hero in love and in war, who was
attentively observing her, Car, seeing her
father enter the room, said hastily,

u I must go and speak to Papa. Do you

know, Lord Westover, that I have been so
inattentive, I have never seen him since I
arrived, and I promised Mamma to take such
care of him; ” and she darted off, but not
before her quick ear had heard some ex-
clamations from both gentlemen, which
dimpled her cheeks with exulting smiles.

“Oh, darling Pappy,” she exclaimed, link-
ing her arm in his, and looking up in his
face with the most endearing expression;
“how careless you must think me not to
have visited you in your room, and asked
about your headache; but how is it ? Mil-
licent and I had so much to say, and then
the dinner-bell rang, and I had not time,
for Fenton was so stupid, and I so missed
Louise.”

“However, I think poor Fenton has
turned you out quite well enough,” the
father said, as he gazed with fond admira-
tion on his beautiful child. And certainly

Digitized by LjOOQie
304 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

Car’s forte must have been acting, for a
most graceful tableau did she enact for the
benefit of the two Lords, who were follow-
ing with their eyes her every movement,
as she hung about her careworn-looking
father, her every look and attitude ap-
parently emanating from the impulse of
natural grace.

Dinner was announced, and she relin-
quished her father’s arm to take that of a
shy eldest son of one of the neighbouring
elite. Lord Westover had told her to
mind that she was to sit on his left
side, the right of course being occupied by
the greatest lady present, to whom, we fear,
his Lordship did not give the largest portion
of his attention. How could he, with such
a magnet so near at hand ?

And Car heard how it was that Lord
Glendinnon had arrived sooner than he was
expected. He had mistaken the day.

“ You must take care of your heart, fair

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

305

lady,” he continued, “ his Lordship is con-
sidered, I can tell you, irresistible.”

“ Oh, no fear of me,” Car answered,
laughing. “It is always being dinned in
my ears that I have no heart.”

And at that moment her eyes turned to-
wards the head of the table, where Lord
Glendinnon was seated by Lady Westover,
Sir Hector occupying the opposite place by
her side. Car was almost startled on per-
ceiving how earnestly he seemed to be re-
garding her.

The colour mounted to her cheeks, caused
by gratified vanity — she felt at once that
her conquest was certain over that fierce-
looking man.

“ It will be delightful,” she thought,
“ something so new. I am so tired of
the same thing over and over again with
all those young Guardsmen, and the other
stupid men, young and old, I have made

fools of. After all, I care not much to waste
my time on boys — they are so silly —
but this splendid-looking creature, neither
young nor old, such a regular lion as to
courage, and looking almost as fierce as any
of the forest monarchs,—Oh ! would it not
be glorious to make him crouch at my feet
for one smile ? ”

And again she looked towards him, and
caught another fixed gaze from his eyes,
which she understood well how to return.

Alas for her young lover! no longer did
this unprincipled girl feel even pity for him.
Before the dinner was concluded, Lord
Glendinnon and Car Eversfield, without
any introduction, and at the distance of the
intervening space of the top and bottom of
a long table, had become perfectly acquaint-
ed with each other.

“ Car,” said Lady Millicent, as they
walked on the terrace on leaving the dinner-
table, “ I am rather alarmed about you.”

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

307

“ Why, what is the matter now ? ”

“ I have been watching you all the time we
were at dinner, and I am quite sure that it
is your intention to commence a flirtation
with Lord Glendinnon.”

“ And why not, pray ? ” asked Car, red-
dening, for Lady Millicent looked graver
than usual. “He is just the man to talk
and laugh with, for every one knows that
he is a safe subject enough, having a wife
somewhere.”

“ Upon my word, Car,” Millicent replied,
“ I used to think I was very bad, hut I have
come to the conclusion that I am a saint
and angel compared with you. Yes, you
may laugh, but I must just again warn you
to take care how you behave to Lord Glen-
dinnon, who is one of the most profligate
men in London. He has been for years
separated from his wife, and is so notori-
ous in his career that few people will now

invite him to their country houses. Mamma
does not at all like his coming here, and
will be greatly disgusted if she sees you
encourage him, and I am sure the General
will be much displeased. I heard him say
that he certainly should not have come to
Westover, had he known Lord Glendin-
non had been invited, which indeed he was
not— he as good as asked himself, and
Papa had not the presence of mind to refuse
him. Mamma hates his being here.”

“I am sure I am glad he did come,”
was Car’s rejoinder. “It does one’s eyes
good to look at such a splendid specimen of
the human race. That is what I call a man,
very unlike those whey-faced youngsters I
am accustomed to see.”

“Yes, and by the bye remember, Car,
what you have just told me about young
Lawless. I consider that you are actually
engaged to him, and after what has passed

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

309

and that ring on your finger, you cannot
possibly get off without a pretty row.”

Car, as usual when vexed, began some
noisy whimperings.

“How cross you are, Milly! just like
the people at home. You of all girls in
the world are the last to have a right to
talk in this manner! A pretty number of
scrapes you have very nearly got into! No
girl in London has ever been more fast than
Millicent Danvers; but just because you
have been so sly and have never been found
out, you fancy yourself so much better than
others. And I am come here to be so happy,
and you are trying to make me miserable.”

And now she began fairly to cry.

“ You had better not disfigure those mis-
chievous eyes,” said Lady Millicent, laugh-
ing, “ for behold, the conquering hero is ad-
vancing. We'had better turn into the flower
garden, that you may have time to shake
the rain-drops from the rose.”

CHAPTER XXIII.

That same night Sir Hector called his
daughter into his room, and spoke to her
very seriously about Lord Glendinnon.
Not that he had observed anything as yet
in her conduct to give him uneasiness, for
Car was rather startled by what her friend
had said, and was afraid of showing any
public demonstration of her determina-
tion to commence a flirtation with Lord
Glendinnon, although she had not lost all
her time, even this evening, for she well
understood the science of by-play.

“ I must just warn you, Car,” her father
said, “ that if I see the slightest inclination

Digitized by LjOOQie
A FAST YOUNG LADY.

311

on your part to receive any attentions from
Lord Glendinnon, I shall take you home
immediately. Nothing -will turn me from
this determination. Had I known he was
to have been here, I should have declined
the invitation at once.”

“ Oh, papa! what does Lord Glendinnon
signify to me?” Car exclaimed petulantly,
“ I shall not be the only girl in the house if
he wishes to amuse himself; there are several
coming to-morrow.”

“ I dare say, but they will probably have
their mothers with them,” and the General
sighed, his thoughts reverting to his sick
wife at home. “ However, Car,” he con-
tinued, more sternly than was his wont
when speaking to his daughter, “ I insist
upon your remembering what I have said;
I am perfectly in earnest.”

But the next morning brought its chan-
ges. Before Car had lifted her head from

x 4

the pillow her father again appeared before
her. The post had brought a letter from
Portsmouth, stating that his second son
Ernest, who had just gone into the navy, had
met with a severe accident, and was left at
the hospital at Portsmouth. He was in no
danger, but the authorities had thought it
expedient to inform Sir Hector of his son’s
state.

“I shall be off immediately. If you write
to your mother to-day, don't mention what
has happened — it would only alarm her,
and I hope I shall find my dear boy in no
kind of danger, indeed they say the hurt he
has received is of no vital importance. How-
ever I could not feel a moment’s peace until
I have seen him, and shall start in half an
hour. Now, Car, do not add to my many
anxieties, by misconducting yourself whilst
I am away. Do you hear, child ? ”

“ Yes, darling Pappy,” the girl cried, start-

ing up and throwing her arms round his
neck — “I shall be so good—don’t fear for
me — and I am so sorry for poor Emy.”

And she looked so lovely, this young
brilliant creature, in all the dishevelled care-
lessness Of her sleeping attire, the glow
of childlike sleep flushing her soft cheeks,
— her dark hair, loosened from the net
which usually confined it, falling on her
white neck—that the doting father, as he
pressed her in his arms, could not keep up
any demonstration of severity.

‘‘ God bless you, my darling,” he mur-
mured as he extricated himself from her em-
brace, “ and keep you in safety. I shall be
back again as soon as possible, I hope, if Emy
is pretty well.” And Car fell back upon her
pillows, and wept, and her tears this time
flowed from a softer, purer source than usual.
“ Poor darling papa! ” she sobbed, “ how
much he always has to vex him. Oh, how

I -wish, I wish I could be good, and not add
to his vexations, but I fear I cannot; and
poor Erny!—he is my favourite brother—a
mad-cap like myself—I really will try to be
sedate, and what is more to the purpose, I
will stay at home to-day. I ought not to go
to the races whilst the poor boy is so ill. I
shall hear to-morrow, andif he is better, then
I can enjoy myself. And I won't go down to
breakfast. I really never was so unhappy! ”

Lady Millicent found her still in bed, so
changed from the brilliant Car of yester-
day,—her eyes, so unaccustomed to shed
tears of sorrow, so red and swollen, that her
friend was quite sorry for the distressed
girl, and said all she could to console her.

“Poor Ernest,” she said, “I know him well,”
though I have not seen him for a year or
two. He is very like you, Car, is he not ?
both in mind and looks, a regular scape-
grace, if I remember right.”

“ Yes, the best of the family,” sobbed Car.

“If he is exactly like you, Car, depend upon
it he will do very well. The bad ones always
outlive the good ones; you and Ernest will
see out all the rest. But you must get up!
"We breakfast unusually early, to be ready
for the races; the drive to Brookwood is a
tedious business.”

“I’m not going to the races,” groaned Car.

“ Not going to the races! Nonsense,
you silly one! ”

“ No indeed ! it would be very unfeeling
to go when my brother is so ill.”

“ After all,” persisted Lady Millicent,
“he has only had a slight crack on the
head, poor boy, and if, when every middy had
a fall, their sisters were to take to their
beds, the world would indeed come to a
pretty pass. Now, Miss Caroline, you shall
just be allowed to have your breakfast up
here, and then, if you please, begin to gird

316 PASSAGES IN THE LIFE OF

your armour on. You have a good deal of
business on hand to-day, remember.”

Yes, Car did remember, and felt at the
moment really averse to going to the races.
She was as sorry for her brother as she
could be for anything, and she did not
feel strong enough to encounter her ardent
young lover, Norman Lawless.

But she was fated to go. Lady Millicent
soon returned to say that Sir Hector’s last
words to Lady Westover before he went,
were, “ "Well, my dear Lady, you will take
care of that madcap child of mine at the
races to-day.”

“ So you see your father expects you to
go, and that he would not do if he appre-
hended any danger to Ernest. No, depend
upon it, this being the first time he has
knocked his head out of reach of Mrs. Nel-
son and her pommade divine, the boy has
made the most of it.”

“ Come now, I shall ring for Mrs.
Fenton, and do you set about your toilette
with all speed. Papa would never get
over it if you did not go. He intends to
drive you in his phaeton, and I believe
Lord Glendinnon and some other man are
to sit in the rumble. And oh! such a
parasol my revered parent has just pro-
duced, which he intends presenting to you.
Were I Mamma I would not allow of such
doings. It must have cost a pretty sum! He
never gives me such things. Now! fair
lady, make haste! By the bye, I hear you
have such loves of bonnets.”

“ Yes, poor Louise made them all, and
they cost next to nothing. She is so clever;
and after all her trouble not to see them on
me,” sighed Car.

Lady Millicent’s inducements were irre-
sistible, and before the toilette was half com-
pleted, Caroline was herself again, quarrel-

ling with the maid one moment, chattering
to Lady Millicent, who looked in ever and
anon to see how she was going on, and
at length finally forgetting all about poor
Ernest and his broken head.

And we must allow that beautiful the
girl looked when at last the unfortunate
abigail had completed her labours, and saw
her young lady leave this room of confusion
worse confounded—dresses ,here, bonnets
there, gloves and small boots littering the
floor. Car had never been so anxious to
make a soignde and becoming morning toi-
lette, and not having Louise to give her
advice, on which her mistress generally
relied as infallible, she became irritable and
impatient to a frightful extent.

She had no opinion of Fenton’s “ dowdy
old taste,” as she called it—was dissatisfied
with everything she said or did, and made
the poor woman so nervous that she felt

Digitized by LjOOQie

inclined to give it up and run out of the
room. At length, after Car had dragged
off a bonnet from her head and thrown it
to the other end of the room, declaring that
Fenton had entirely put it out of shape by
her clumsy manner of handling it, and had
torn off her back a beautiful, new, expensive
French muslin, because she insisted that
the flounces had not been properly ironed
out, the poor woman could bear it no
■longer.

Bursting into tears she declared that
having done her best to please, and totally
failing, she really could do no more.

“I shall speak to the General when he
returns, Miss Eversfield, and tell him that
I am of no use to you, and entreat him
to send me back.”

Car was alarmed. In a subdued tone she
said,

“ How silly you are, Fenton!—don’t you

know it’s my way ? I often get into rages
with Louise even. I think nothing of
slapping her face when I am in a passion.
I don’t mean all I do and say.”

“ But I do, Miss Eversfield, and cannot
stand it any longer; and to think of your
destroying that expensive dress and that
pretty bonnet, and your papa and mamma,
with their large family, little able to afford
such extravagant waste. No, indeed, I
should go into a fever if I were to wait
upon you much longer, Miss Car.”

“ Oh, good gracious! ” thought Car,
“ what in the name of patience am I to do ?
Now this botheration old creature, what a
scrape she will get me into if she complains
to papa, and just now too! ”

And Car was obliged to do violence to
her feelings, and beg pardon, and coax, and
fondle the good woman, who had been with

Lady Julia many years, ever since Car could
remember.

You wouldn’t be so cruel as to tease
papa just at this moment, when he is so
miserable about poor Emy,—your favourite
Emy, Fenton ? ”

“ I am very, very sorry for your papa and
Master Ernest,” Fenton replied, “ but he is
not my favourite, Miss Car. My favourite
is that dear, good son, Mr. Albert.”

“ Ah, that’s a cut at me. Ernest is too
like a certain bad girl called Caroline to be
your dearest, Fenton;” and she looked
slyly at the maid. “ Ah, yes, I see that is
the reason; you cannot deny it;” and seeing
a half-smile on the tear-stained face of the
poor woman, Car thought her victory won,
and putting her two hands upon her shoul-

said,—

“I shall not let you stir, Fenton, till you
say you have forgiven me, and that you
will not tell papa. You will see how pretty
behaved I shall be. You will even fancy
you are waiting upon Gerry.”

“ Oh, I shall never take you for dear
Miss Geraldine,” Fenton replied, with an
ironical emphasis in her tone, “ but as you
say you will behave better, Miss Caroline,
of course I must try to remain with you
whilst you are here; but oh!” she exclaimed,
taking up the remains of the pretty French
muslin, “ what in the world can be done
with this ? It is past my skill at mending.
And to think of the money it cost! ”
