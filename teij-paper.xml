            <p>Any expansion of the TEI beyond its traditional user-base involves a recognition of
               differing answers to the traditional question <q>What is text, really?</q> [<ref
                  target="#B06">de Rose et al 2002</ref>; <ref target="#B05">Caton 2013</ref>; <ref
                  target="#B10">van Zundert and Andrews, 2017</ref>], and hence a rethinking of some
               aspects of TEI praxis. We report on work carried out in the context of the COST
               Action "Distant Reading for European Literary History" (CA16204), in particular on the TEI-conformant schemas
               developed for one of the Action's principal deliverables: the European Literary Text
               Collection (ELTeC). </p>
            <p>The ELTeC will contain comparable corpora for each of a dozen European languages,
               each being a balanced sample of 100 novels from the 19th century, together with
               metadata situating them in their contexts of production and of reception. We hope
               that it will become a reliable basis for comparative work in data-driven textual
               analytics, enabling researchers to go beyond a simple <soCalled>bag of
                  words</soCalled> approach, while respecting views of "what text really is"
               currently dominant in such fields as statistically-derived authorship attribution,
               topic modelling, character network analysis, and stylistic analysis in general. </p>
            <p>The focus of the ELTeC encoding scheme is not to represent texts in all their
               original complexity, nor to duplicate the work of scholarly editors. Instead, we aim
               to facilitate a richer and better-informed distant reading than a transcription of
               lexical content alone would permit. Where the TEI permits diversity, we enforce
               consistency, by defining encodings which permit only a specific and quite small set
               of textual features, both structural and lexical. We also define a single
               TEI-conformant way of representing the results of textual analyses such as named
               entity recognition or morphological parsing, and a specific set of metadata features.
               These constraints are expressed by a master TEI ODD, from which we derive three
               different schemas by ODD-chaining, each associated with appropriate documentation.

            <head>Introduction</head>
            <p>Comity is a term from theology or political studies, where it is used to describe the
               formal recognition by different religions, nation states, or cultures that other such
               entities have as much right to existence as themselves. In applied linguistics, the
               term has also been used by such writers as Widdowson or Aston [<ref target="#B01"
                  >Aston 1988</ref>] seeking to demonstrate how the establishment of comity can
               facilitate successful inter-cultural communication, even in the absence of linguistic
                  competence<note place="foot"><q>Those participating in conversational encounters
                     have to have a care for the preservation of good relations by promoting the
                     other's positive self-image, by avoiding offence, encouraging comity, and so
                     on. The negotiation of meaning is also a negotiation of social relations.</q>
                  <ref target="#B11">Widdowson, 1990, p. 110</ref></note>. We appropriate the term
               here in this latter sense, as a means of re-asserting the inter-disciplinary roots of
               the TEI. </p>
            <p>Recent histories of the TEI (e.g. <ref target="#B07">Gavin, 2019</ref>) have a
               tendency to under-emphasize the multiplicity of disciplines gathered at its birth,
               preferring to focus on those disciplines which can be plausibly framed as prefiguring
               our current configuration of the <soCalled>digital humanities</soCalled> in some way.
               Yet the Poughkeepsie conference and the process of designing the Guidelines which
               followed alike were kickstarted by input from corpus linguists and computer
               scientists as well as traditional philologically-minded editors and source-driven
               historians. The TEI belongs to a multiplicity of research communities, dating as it
               does from a period when computational linguists and traditional philologists alike
               were beginning to wake up to the implications of the advent of massive amounts of
               digital text for their disciplines. The steering committee which oversaw its
               development and the TEI editors alike conscientiously attempted to ensure that the
               Guidelines should reflect a view of text which was generally shared and generic,
               rather than specific to any discipline or to any particular usage model. </p>
            <p>The TEI's radical proposition that there was such a thing as a single abstract model
               of textual components, which might usefully be considered independently of its
               expression in a particular source or output, or its use in any particular discipline,
               was necessarily at odds with at least two prevailing orthodoxies: on the one hand,
               the view that a text is no less and no more than the physical documents which
               instantiate it, and can be adequately described and represented by its salient visual
               properties alone; on the other hand, the view that a text is solely a linguistic
               phenomenon, comprising a bag of words, the statistical properties of which are
               adequate to describe it. But the TEI tried very hard to prefer comity over conflict,
               not only in its organization, which brought together an extraordinarily heterogeneous
               group of experts, but also in its chief outputs: a set of encoding Guidelines which
               while supporting specialization did not require any particular specialisation to
               prevail. </p>
            <p>Old orthodoxies do not die easily, and it is interesting to hear how some of the same
               arguments are still being played out in the somewhat different context of today's DH
               theorizers. But in our present paper, we simply want to explore the extent to which
               the TEI's model of text can be adapted to conform to the model of text characterising
               such fields as stylometry, stylistics, textual analytics, or (to use the current
               term) <soCalled>distant reading</soCalled>. We hope also to explore the claim that by
               so doing we may facilitate the enrichment of that model, and thus facilitate more
               sophisticated research into textual phenomena across different corpora. And we hope
               to demonstrate that this is best done by cultivating mutual respect for the widely
               differing scientific, cultural, and linguistic traditions characterising this
               cross-European and cross-disciplinary project, that is, by acknowledging a comity of
               methods as well as languages.</p>
            <p>Our approach focuses on using the TEI predominantly as an format for exchange and as
               a starting point for further transformation, conversion and enrichment processes that
               might result in different formats. </p>

            <head>The COST Action “Distant Reading for European Literary History” </head>
            <p>The context for this work is the EU-funded COST Action “Distant Reading for European
               Literary History” (CA 16204), a principal deliverable of which will be the European
               Literary Text Collection (ELTeC).<note place="foot"><p><ref
                        target="https://www.distant-reading.net"
                        >https://www.distant-reading.net</ref></p></note> This is a set of
               comparable corpora for each of at least a dozen European languages, each corpus
               being a balanced selection of 100 novels from the 19th century, together with
               metadata situating them in their contexts of production and of reception. It is hoped
               that the ELTeC will become a reliable basis for comparative work in cross-linguistic
               data-driven textual analytics, eventually providing an accessible benchmark for a
               particular written genre of considerable cultural importance across Europe during the
               period between 1840 and 1920. </p>
            <p>Two significant decisions made early on in the planning of the COST Action underlie
               the work reported here. Firstly, it was agreed that the ELTeC should be delivered in
               a TEI-encoded format, using a schema developed specifically for the project.
               Secondly, the design of that encoding scheme, in particular the textual features it
               makes explicit by means of markup, should be defined as far as possible by the needs
               of the distant reading research community, rather than any pre-existing notion of
               textual ontology, to the extent that the needs of that community could be determined.
               The target audience envisaged includes experts in computational stylistics, in corpus
               linguistics, in computational literary studies and in traditional literary studies as well as more general digital
               humanists, but is probably best characterized as having major enthusiasm and
               expertise in the application of statistical methods to literary and linguistic
               analysis, and only minor interest in the kinds of textual features most TEI projects
               have tended to focus on. </p>

               is carried out in four Working Groups: WG1 Scholarly Resources is responsible for the
               work described in this paper; WG2 Methods and Tools is concerned with text analytic
               techniques and tools; WG3 Literary Theory and History is concerned with applications
               and implications of those methods and for literary theory ; WG4 Dissemination is
               responsible for outreach and communication. </p>
            <p>The design and construction of the ELTeC is the responsibility of WG1, as noted
               above. Initially, this work was split into three distinct tasks: First, defining
               selection criteria (corpus design); second, developing basic encoding methods (both
               for data and for metadata); and third, defining a suitable workflow for preparation
               of the corpus. Working papers on each of these topics plus a fourth on theoretical
               issues of sampling and balance were prepared for discussion and approval by the
               members of WG1, and remain available from the Working Group's website. <note

            <head>The ELTeC Encoding Scheme/s</head>
            <p>The encoding requirements for ELTeC were perceived by WG1 to be somewhat different
               from those of many other TEI projects. Distant Reading methods cover a wide range of
               computational approaches to literary text analysis, such as authorship attribution,
               topic modelling, character network analysis, or stylistic analysis but they are
               rarely concerned with editorial matters such as textual variation, the establishment
               of an authoritative text, or production of print or online versions of a text.
               Consequently, the ELTeC encoding scheme was deliberately not intended to represent
               source documents in all their original complexity of structure or appearance, but
               rather to make it as simple as possible to access the words of which texts are
               composed in an informed and predictable way. The goal was neither to duplicate the
               work of scholarly editors nor to produce (yet another) digital edition of a specific
               source document. Rather, the encoding scheme was designed in such a way as to ensure
               that ELTeC texts could be processed by simple minded (but XML-aware) systems
               primarily concerned with lexis and to make life easier for the developers of such
               systems.</p>
            <p>Next to the application scenarios for distant reading, the multi-lingual and European
               perspective of ELTeC poses further requirements for the encoding. The encoding should
               be applicable to different languages as well as language- or context-specific
               publication traditions and realisations during the entire period and across Europe.
               We need to expect different realisations of text and chapter structure as well as
               paratextual organisations. Here, an encoding schema should ensure that we achieve
               uniformity in concentrating on uniform characteristics without considering specifica
               of certain printing houses. </p>
            <p>An important principle following from this latter goal is that ELTeC markup should
               offer the encoder very little choice, and the software developer very few surprises:
               the number of tags available is greatly reduced, and their application is tightly
               constrained. It facilitates processing greatly if access to each part of the XML tree
               can be provided in a uniform and consistent way across multiple ELTeC corpora.</p>
            <p>By default, the TEI provides a very rich vocabulary, and many subtly different ways
               of doing more or less the same thing. TEI encoders have frequently taken full
               advantage of that to produce texts which vary enormously, both in the subset of XML
               tags used and in the range of attribute values associated with them. It is tempting,
               but entirely mistaken, to assume that the allegedly TEI-conformant deliverables from
               project A will necessarily be marked up in the same way as the allegedly
               TEI-conformant deliverables from project B <note place="foot">A large-scale project
                  called MONK (Metadata Offer New Knowledge) demonstrated some of the technical
                  consequences of this for integrated searching of TEI resources: see further <ref
                     target="http://monk.library.illinois.edu"
                     >http://monk.library.illinois.edu</ref></note>. On the contrary, all that
                  <soCalled>TEI conformance</soCalled> really guarantees is that the intended
               semantics of the markup used by the two projects should be recoverable by reference
               to a published standard, and are not entirely ad hoc or sui generis. (This may not
               seem much of an advance, though it is: see further [<ref target="#B04a">Burnard
                  2019</ref>]). </p>
            <p>Following this No Surprises principle, the simplest ELTeC schema (the <soCalled>level
                  zero </soCalled> schema) provides the bare minimum of tags needed to mark up the
               typical structure and content of a nineteenth century novel. All preliminary matter
               other than the title-page and any authorial preface or introduction is discarded; the
               remainder is marked as a <gi>div</gi> of <att>type</att>
               <val>titlepage</val> or <val>liminal</val>, within a <gi>front</gi> element. Within
               the <gi>body</gi> of a text, the <gi>div</gi> element is also used to make explicit
               its structural organization, with <att>type</att> attribute values <val>part</val>,
                  <val>chapter</val>, or <val>letter</val> only<note place="foot">An exception is
                  made for epistolary novels which contain only the representation of a sequence of
                  letters, with no other significant content: these may be marked as <tag>div
                     type="letter"</tag></note>. For our purposes, a <q>chapter</q> is considered to
               be the smallest subsection of a novel within which paragraphs of text appear
               directly. Further subdivisions within a chapter (often indicated conventionally by
               ellipses, dashes, stars etc.) are marked using the <gi>milestone</gi> element; larger
               groupings of <gi>div</gi> elements are indicated by <gi>div</gi> elements, always of
               type <val>part</val>, whatever their hierarchic level. Headings, at whatever level,
               are always marked using the <gi>head</gi> element when appearing at the start of a
                  <gi>div</gi>, and the <gi>trailer</gi> element when appearing at the end. Within
               the <gi>div</gi> element, only a very limited number of elements is permitted:
               specifically, in addition to those already mentioned, <gi>p</gi> or <gi>l</gi> (verse
               line). Within these elements we find either plain text, <gi>hi</gi> (highlighted),
                  <gi>pb</gi> (page break) or <gi>milestone</gi> elements. After some debate, the
               Action's Management Committee agreed that it would be practical to require only this
               tiny subset of the TEI for all ELTeC texts. </p>
            <p> It should be noted that the texts included in an ELTeC corpus may come from
               different kinds of sources. For some language collections, no digital texts of any
               kind exist: the encoder must start from page images, manually transcribe or put them
               through OCR, and introduce ELTeC markup from scratch. For others, existing digital
               texts may already be available: the encoder must research the format used and find a
               way of converting it to ELTeC's TEI encoding schema. In some cases, a TEI version may
               already exist; in others a project Gutenberg HTML version; in yet others the text may
               be stored in a database of some kind. Whichever is the case, if it is possible to
               retain distinctions which the ELTeC scheme permits, this is clearly desirable;
               perhaps less obviously, it is also necessary to remove distinctions made by the
               original format which the ELTeC scheme does not permit. This diversity of source
               material was one motivation for permitting multiple encoding levels in the ELTeC
               scheme: at level zero, only a bare minimum of markup is required or permitted, while
               at level 1 a slightly richer (but still minimalist) encoding is also defined. At
               level 2, further tags again are introduced to support linguistic processing of
               various kinds, as discussed further below. Down-conversion from a higher to a lower
               level is always automatically possible, but up-conversion from a lower to a higher
               level generally requires human intervention or additional processing. </p>
            <p>At level 1, the following additional distinctions may be made in an encoding: <list>
                  <item>the <gi>label</gi> element may be used for heading-like titles appearing in
                     the middle of a division; </item>
                  <item>the <gi>quote</gi> element may be used to distinguish passages such as
                     quotations, epigraphs, stretches of verse, letters etc. which seem to
                        <q>float</q> within the running text; </item>
                  <item>the <gi>corr</gi> element may be used to indicate a passage (typically a
                     word or phrase) which is clearly erroneous in the original and which has been
                     editorially corrected; </item>
                  <item>the elements <gi>foreign</gi>, <gi>emph</gi>, or <gi>title</gi> are
                     available and should be used in preference to <gi>hi</gi> for passages rendered
                     in a different font or otherwise made visually salient in the source, where an
                     encoder can do so with confidence; </item>
                  <item>the element <gi>gap</gi> may be used to indicate where some component of a
                     source (typically an illustration) has been left out of the encoding; </item>
                  <item>the elements <gi>note</gi> and <gi>ref</gi> may be used to capture the
                     location and content of authorially supplied footnotes or end-notes; wherever
                     they occur in the source, notes must be collected together in a <tag>div
                        type="notes"</tag> within a <gi>back</gi> element.</item>
               </list></p>
            <p>This list of elements may seem distressingly small. It lacks entirely some elements
               which every TEI introductory course regards as indispensable (no <gi>list</gi> or
                  <gi>item</gi>; no <gi>choice</gi> or <gi>abbr</gi>; no <gi>name</gi> or
                  <gi>date</gi>...) and tolerates some practices bordering on tag abuse. For
               example, all the components of a title page are marked as <gi>p</gi> since no
               specialised elements (<gi>titlePage</gi>, <gi>docImprint</gi> etc.) are available. In
               the absence of specialised but culture-specific features (for example, publisher
               name, imprint, imprimatur, etc.) the encoding identifies only fundamental textual
               features common to every kind of text. Nevertheless, we believe that the set of
               concepts it supports overlaps well with the set of textual features which almost any
               existing digital transcription will seek to preserve in some form or another. This
               may explain both why the majority of the texts so far collected in the ELTeC have
               been encoded at level 1 rather than level 0, and also the speed with which the
               collection is growing.</p>
            <!-- example? -->
            <p>ELTeC level 1 is intended to facilitate a richer and better-informed distant reading
               of a text than a transcription of its verbal content alone would permit. ELTeC level
               2 is partly intended to provide a consistent and TEI-conformant way of representing
               the results of such readings, in particular those concerned with linguistic
               annotation. Its primary goal is to represent in a standard way additional layers of
               annotation of particular importance to distant reading applications such as
               stylometry or topic modelling. Enrichment of each lexical token to indicate its
               morpho-syntactic category (POS) or its lemma, and identification of tokens which
               refer to named entities are both well within the scope of existing text processing
               techniques, and are also routinely used in distant reading applications. The
               challenge is that the input and the output formats typically used by such tools are
               rarely XML-based, and seem superficially to have a model of text quite different from
               that of the <soCalled>ordered hierarchy of content objects</soCalled> in terms of
               which the TEI community traditionally operates. For many in the distant reading
               community (it seems), a text is little more than a sequence of tokens, mostly
               corresponding with orthographically-defined words, though there is some variability
               in the principles underlying the process of tokenisation, for example in the
               modelling of clitics, compound forms, etc. Each token has a number of properties,
               which might include such attributes as its part of speech, its lemma, or its position
               in the sequence of tokens making up the document. Information about a token which in
               an XML model would be properties of some higher level construct such as its status as
               dialogue, quoted matter, emphasis, etc. is occasionally considered as well, but is
               typically modelled as an additional property of the token.</p>
            <p> If a community is defined by its tools, it would appear therefore that the distant
               reading community has not fully embraced the notion of XML as anything other than a
               rather verbose archival format. However, communities are not defined solely by their
               tools: by seeking a way of reconciling these differing views of what text really is
               in a spirit of comity we hope to demonstrate that there are advantages both for the
               distant reader or stylometrician and for the literary analyst or textual editor. </p>
            <p>At ELTeC level2, all existing elements are retained and two new elements <gi>s</gi>
               and <gi>w</gi> are introduced to support segmentation of running text into
               sentence-like and word-like sequences respectively. Individual tokens are marked
               using the <gi>w</gi> element, and decorated with one or more of the TEI-defined
               linguistic attributes <att>pos</att>, <att>lemma</att>, and <att>join</att>. Both
               words and punctuation marks are considered to be <soCalled>tokens</soCalled> in this
               sense, although the TEI suggests distinguishing the two cases using <gi>w</gi> and
                  <gi>pc</gi> respectively. The <gi>s</gi> (segment) element is used to provide an
               end-to-end tessellating segmentation of the whole sequence of <gi>w</gi> elements,
               based on orthographic form. This provides a convenient extension of the existing
               text-body-div hierarchy within which tokens are located. </p>
            <p>The elements <gi>p</gi>, <gi>head</gi>, and <gi>l</gi> (which contain just text at
               levels 0 and 1) at level 2 can contain a sequence of <gi>s</gi> elements. Empty
               elements <gi>gap</gi>, <gi>milestone</gi>, <gi>pb</gi> or <gi>ref</gi> are also
               permitted within text content at any point, but these are disregarded when
               segmentation is carried out. Each <gi>s</gi> element can contain a sequence of
                  <gi>w</gi> elements, either directly, or wrapped in one of the sub-paragraph
               elements <gi>corr</gi>, <gi>emph</gi>, <gi>foreign</gi>, <gi>hi</gi>, <gi>label</gi>,
                  <gi>title</gi>. To this list we might add the element <gi>rs</gi> (referring
               string), provided by the TEI for the encoding of any form of entity name, such as a
               Named Entity Recognition procedure might produce. </p>
            <p> This approach implies that <gi>w</gi> elements may appear at two levels in the
               hierarchy which may upset some software; it also implies that <gi>w</gi> elements
               must be properly contained within one of these elements, without overlap. If either
               issue proves to be a major stumbling block, an alternative would be to remove the
               tags demarcating these sub-paragraph elements, indicating their semantics instead by
               additional attribute values on the <gi>w</gi> elements they contain. </p>
            <p>This TEI XML format is equally applicable to the production of training data for
               applications using machine learning techniques and to the outputs of such systems.
               However, since such machine learning applications typically operate on text content
               in a tabular format only, XSLT filters which transform (or generate) the XML markup
               discussed here from such tabular formats without loss of information are envisaged.
               At the time of writing, however, Working Group 2 has yet to put this proposed
               architecture to the test. </p>

            <head>ELTeC metadata and corpus design</head>
            <p>Like every other TEI document, every ELTeC text has a TEI Header, though its
               organization and content alike are constrained much more tightly than is common TEI
               praxis, for the reasons already mentioned. The structure of an ELTeC Header is the
               same no matter what level of encoding applies to the text. It provides minimal
               bibliographic information about the encoded text and its source, sufficient to
               identify the text and its author, in a fixed and consistent format. It is assumed
               that if more detailed bibliographic information is required, for example about the
               author or work encoded, this is better obtained from standard authority files; to
               that end a VIAF code may be associated with them. </p>
            <!-- example here? -->
            <p>As noted above, ELTeC texts may be derived from many sources, each of which should be
               documented correctly in the header's <gi>sourceDesc</gi> element. After some debate,
               a common set of practices has been identified to distinguish (for example) ELTeC
               texts derived directly from a print source from those derived from a digital source,
               itself derived from a known print source, and to provide information about each
               source. In the following example, the source of the ELTeC version is a pre-existing
               digital edition provided by Project Gutenberg
               <!--the Bibliothèque nationale de France at the address
               specified (ARK -\- Archival Resource Key -\- is the acronym used by the BNF for the
               permanent identifiers it provides for its digital collections)-->,
               but the source description also provides information about the first print edition of
               the work concerned. <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">

               In most cases, the ELTeC text will correspond with the first edition of a work in
               book form; but even where this is not the case, or where information about the
               precise source used is not available, minimal information about that first edition
               should also be provided in order to place the work in its original temporal context. </p>
            <p>As with other TEI conformant documents, beside the mandatory file description, the
               TEI Header of every ELTeC text contains a publication statement which specifies its
               licensing conditions (all ELTeC documents are licensed CC-BY); an encoding statement
               specifying the level of encoding used; and a revision description containing
               versioning information. The TEI Header is also used to provide metadata describing
               the associated text in a standardized form; this is held in the <gi>profileDesc</gi>
               element which must specify the languages used by the text, may optionally include a
                  <gi>textClass</gi> element containing any culture-specific keywords considered
               useful to describe the text, and must contain a <gi>textDesc</gi> element which
               documents the text's status with respect to selection criteria discussed below. </p>
            <p>One of the knottier problems or (to be positive) more distinctive features of an
               ELTeC corpus is that it is not intended to be an <foreign>ad
                  hoc</foreign> accidentally constructed collection but a designed corpus. Its composition
               is determined not by the happenstance of whatever we can get our hands on, but is
               instead defensible, at least in theory, as a principled and representative
               selection.</p>
            <p>The big question is, of course, representative of <hi>what</hi>.</p>
            <p>It would be nice to say that it represents the production of novels in a specific
               language in 19th century Europe. WG1 has working definitions for both "novels" and
               "Europe" which we do not discuss further here, though both are clearly problematic
               terms. It is hoped that the ELTeC will provide data for an empirical discussion of
               such terms, feeding into the work of WG3 on literary theory and terminology. </p>
            <p> But we cannot make that claim without any data about the population we are claiming
               to represent -- which is hard to come by for many of the languages concerned. We know
               about the novels which we know about, which tend to be the ones that national
               libraries or equivalent cultural heritage institutions have chosen to preserve, which
               publishers over time have been able to sell, and which lecturers in literary studies
               have chosen to teach. More ephemeral titles may have been collected (for example by a
               copyright library); but equally well may have been discarded or even suppressed as
               unworthy of inclusion in the national patrimony. Titles and authors alike can go in
               and out of fashion. But how can we express opinions about changes in the nature of
               the published novel if the sample on which we base those opinions is wildly different
               in composition from the actual population? If our data leads us to assert that novels
               in a given language are never written by women, or are never of fewer than 100,000
               words is this simply because no female authors happen to have been preserved, or
               because short novels were routinely discarded from the collection? Or, on the other
               hand, does this actually indicate something fundamental, a characteristic of the
               population we are investigating? This matters particularly for ELTeC, one of the
               goals of which is precisely to facilitate cross-language comparisons.</p>
            <p>This problem of representativeness is of course one which every corpus linguist has
               to face, and discussions of its implications are easy to find in the literature <note
                  place="foot">Some notable examples include <ref target="#B02">Biber, 1993</ref>;
                     <ref target="#B12">Lüdeling, 2011</ref>; <ref target="#B03">Bode,
                  2018</ref></note></p>
            <p>Our approach is to sidestep the impossibility of representing an unknown (and
               sometimes unknowable) population by attempting instead to represent the range of
               possible variation in the values of a predefined set of variables, each corresponding
               with a more or less objective category of information available for all members of
               the population. To take a trivial example, every novel can be characterised as short,
               medium, or long; there is no possible fourth value for this category unless we revise
               our definition of length (elastic? unknown? instantaneous?). So, as a working
               hypothesis, we might say that a corpus in which roughly a third of the titles are
               short, a third are long, and a third are medium will represent the variation possible
               for this category. If we apply this principle uniformly across all our corpora, we
               can reliably investigate (for example) cross language variation in some other
               observable phenomenon (say a fondness for syntactically complex sentences) with
               respect to length. But note that we have made absolutely no claim about whether novel
               length in the underlying population is also divided in this way. </p>
            <p>The decade in which a novel first appears in book form is a similarly objectively
               characteristic, which in principle we can determine for every member of the
               population. We can also classify every title according to the actual sex of their
               author(s) (with values such as female, male, mixed, unknown). And we can likewise
               classify a title in terms of its staying power or persistence by looking at the
               number of times it has been reprinted since its first appearance. We suggest that
               texts which have been frequently reprinted over a long period may reasonably be
               considered <soCalled>canonical</soCalled> in some sense of that vexed term. The goal
               of our corpus balancing exercise is to ensure more or less equal time for each
               possible value for each of these four categories -- size, decade, author sex, and
               canonicity. </p>
            <p>Ideally, each corpus should have equivalent numbers not just for each value, but for
               each combination of values: so, for example, looking at the third of all titles which
               are characterised as "short", there should be roughly equal numbers for each decade
               of first appearance, roughly equal numbers by male and female authors, and so on.
               This may however be a council of perfection. It is already apparent that for some
               languages, it is very difficult to find any texts at all within some time periods, or
               by female authors. Similarly, our definition of "short" (10-50 thousand words),
               "medium" (50-100 thousand words) and "long" (over 100 thousand words) though
               objective and easy to validate, assumes that there will be enough novels of a given
               length in the underlying population for us to extract a balanced sample; but in some
               languages it may be that the distribution of lengths across the population is
               entirely different. We cannot tell whether (for example) the absence of any "long"
               novels at all in Czech, Serbian, or Norwegian is characteristic of those languages,
               or an artefact of the selection process so far. Another difficulty is that our corpus
               design deliberately seeks to include some forgotten or marginal works along with
               well-known canonical texts: this is relatively easy for traditions such as English,
               French, or German where copyright laws have led to the maintenance and documentation
               of large national collections, but less so for other less well documented languages.
               (For some initial data, see the summary page at <ref
                  target="http://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/"
                  >https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/</ref>)</p>
            <p>To encode these balance criteria in the TEI Header in as direct and accessible a
               manner as possible, we have chosen to re-purpose the little-used <gi>textDesc</gi>
               element, originally provided by the TEI as a wrapper for a set of so-called
               situational parameters proposed by corpus linguists as a way of objectively
               characterizing linguistic production <note place="foot">The <gi>textDesc</gi> element
                  is discussed in section 15.2.1 of the TEI <title>Guidelines</title> (<ref
                     target="https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CC.html#CCAHTD"
                     >https://tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/CC.html#CCAHTD</ref>).
               </note> In our case, we replace the TEI's suggested vocabulary for these parameters
               with a vocabulary representing our four criteria, expressed as new non-TEI elements
               in the ELTeC namespace. These elements (<gi>eltec:sex</gi>, <gi>eltec:size</gi>,
                  <gi>eltec:reprintCount</gi>, and <gi>eltec:timeSlot</gi>) are required by the ELTeC
               schemas and have an attribute <att>key</att> which supplies a coded value for the
               criterion concerned taken from a predefined closed list. So, for example, a long
               (over 100,000 words) novel by a female author first published between 1881 and 1900
               but only infrequently reprinted thereafter might have a text description like the
               following: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples">
                  <textDesc xmlns:eltec="http://distant-reading.net/ns">
                     <eltec:authorGender key="F"/>
                     <eltec:reprintCount key="low"/>
                     <eltec:size key="long"/>
                     <eltec:timeSlot key="T3"/>
                  </textDesc>
               </egXML>
            </p>
            <p>When complete, this information can be used to select subcorpora from the corpus
               as a whole, thus permitting more delicate cross-linguistic comparisons: for example
               between the lexis of male and female writers, or between the stylistic features
               typically associated with long or short texts. During the construction phase, these
               coded values also make it easy to monitor the emerging composition of the corpus, for
               example to detect whether or not the ratio of male to female writers is consistent
               across different time periods, by means of a simple visualisation like the following <figure>
                  <graphic url="https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/eng/mosaic.jpg"/>
               </figure></p>
            <p>This <soCalled>mosaic plot</soCalled> for the current state of the English corpus (91
               texts) shows that there are roughly as many female (blue) as male (pink) writers
               across the board, but that there is a preponderance of long texts and of titles
               published in time slot 3. </p>
            <p><figure>
                  <graphic url="https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/hun/mosaic.jpg"/>
               </figure></p>
            <p>For comparison, the same plot for the current state of the Hungarian corpus (100
               texts) shows significantly fewer female writers, and a higher proportion of short
               texts. Whether these variations are an artefact of the sampling process or represent
               differences in the underlying population is precisely one of the research questions
               which our approach requires us to address. </p>

            <head>Chaining ODDs</head>
            <p>The TEI's ODD (One Document Does it all) system [<ref target="#B09">Rahtz and
                  Burnard, 2013</ref>] is widely used as a means of customizing the TEI and
               documenting the customization in a standard way. When only a single ODD customization
               is used across a project, there is a natural tendency to produce broadly permissive
               schemas, to allow for the inevitable variation of requirements when material of
               different kinds are to be processed in an integrated collection. But this prevents
               the encoder from taking full advantage of the ability of an XML schema to check that
               particular documents conform to predefined rules, unless they are willing greatly to
               increase the complexity of their work flow. A better approach, pioneered by the
               Deutsches Textarchiv <ref target="#B08"> [Haaf and Thomas 2016]</ref>, has been the use
               of a technique known as ODD chaining <ref target="#B04">[Burnard 2016]</ref> Here, a
               project first defines a base ODD which selects all the TEI components considered to
               be useful anywhere and then uses this as the basis for smaller, more constraining,
               ODDs which select from the base only the components (or other rules) specific to a
               subset of the project's documentary universe. For example, an archive may have
               identified a common set of metadata it wishes to document across all of its holdings
               but also have particular metadata requirements for print and manuscript sources
               respectively. Simply defining two different ODDs, one for print and one for
               manuscript when many other components apply to either kind of source opens the door
               to redundant duplication and the risk of inconsistency. The ODD chaining approach
               requires definition of a base ODD which contains the union of the components needed
               for these two different ODDs, constructed as an appropriate selection from the full
               range of TEI components. The ODDs for print and manuscript are then defined as
               further specialisations or customizations of the base, ensuring thereby that the
               common components are used in a consistent manner, but preserving comity by allowing
               equal status to the two specialised schemas. </p>
            <p>In the ELTeC project, we begin by defining an ODD which selects from the TEI all the
               components used by any ELTeC schema at any level. This ODD also contains
               documentation and specifies usage constraints applicable across every schema. This
               base ODD is then processed using the TEI standard <ident>odd2odd</ident> stylesheet
               to produce a standalone set of TEI specifications which we call
                  <ident>eltec-library</ident>. Three different ODDs, eltec-0, eltec-1, and eltec-2
               then derive specific schemas and documentation for each of the three ELTeC levels,
               using this library of specifications as a base rather than the whole of the TEI. This
               enables us to customize the TEI across the whole project, while at the same time
               respecting three different views of the resulting encoding standard. As with other
               ODDs, we are then able to produce documentation and formal schemas which reflect
               exactly the scope of each encoding level. </p>
            <p> The ODD sources and their outputs are maintained on GitHub and are also being
               published on Zenodo along with the ELTeC texts. <note place="foot">The GitHub
                  repository for the ELTeC collection is found at https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ :
                  the Zenodo community within which it is being published lives at: <ref
                     target="https://zenodo.org/communities/eltec/"

         <div>
            <head>State of play and future work</head>
            <p>The ELTeC is still very much a work in progress and hence we cannot report that our
               design goals have been achieved with any plausibility. An initial release (v0.5.0) of the
               collection has been published on Zenodo in November 2019, and we expect several future releases
               before the target of 100 texts per language is reached. The corpora are also
               maintained as a collection of publicly visible GitHub repositories, as noted
               above.</p>
            <p>As well as continuing to expand the collection, and continuing to fine-tune its
               composition, we hope to improve the consistency and reliability of the metadata
               associated with each text, as far as possible automatically. For example, we have
               developed two complementary methods of automatically counting the number of reprints
               for each title, one by screen scraping from WorldCat, and the other by processing
               data from a Z39.50 server where this is available. These methods should provide more
               reliable data than has hitherto been available for the
                  <soCalled>reprintCount</soCalled> criterion mentioned above.</p>
            <p>The main area of future work we anticipate is however in the testing of the proposed
               ELTeC level 2 encoding and an evaluation of its usefulness. At a technical level,
               this may necessitate some changes in the existing markup scheme, but of perhaps more
               interest is the extent to which its availability will exemplify the virtue of
               striving for comity amongst the many ways in which TEI XML markup can be applied.
