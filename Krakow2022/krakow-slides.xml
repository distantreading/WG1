    <head>ELTeC is a collection; ELTeC-xxx is a corpus</head>
    <list>
     <item>We follow Sinclair (1991) in regarding a <term>corpus</term> as a special kind of
      <term>collection</term> of texts: <eg>“A collection of naturally occurring language text,
      chosen to characterize a state or variety of a language.” <lb/>
       (John Sinclair, <hi>Corpus, Concordance, Collocation</hi>, 1991)</eg></item>
     <item>ELTeC corpora are <emph>designed</emph>, in the sense that their components were chosen
      using explicit selection criteria</item>
     <item>ELTeC corpora <emph>representative</emph> with respect to those criteria, following Biber
      (1993): <eg>“Representativeness refers to the extent to which a sample includes the full range
      of variability in a population.” <lb/>
       (Douglas Biber, <hi>Representativeness in Corpus Design</hi>, 1993)</eg></item>
     <item>Hence, the project plan specifies <q>comparable corpora</q>, each providing a <q>balanced
      selection of one hundred novels from the period 1840 to 1920</q></item>

     <item>Defining the population we wish to sample : what is a "novel" ?</item>
     <item>Defining the sample : what are the selection criteria ? </item>

    <p rend="box">The answers to these questions turn out to be subtly different in different

   <div type="slide">
    <head>Our selection criteria</head>
    <list>
     <item>We specified four <q>balance criteria</q> : <list>
      <item>date of first publication in book form</item>
      <item>size in pages</item>
      <item>author gender</item>
      <item>"canonicity" -- operationalised as the number of times a work was republished </item>
      </list></item>
     <item>Criteria we did <emph>not</emph> consider include: <list>
      <item>genre</item>
      <item>topic</item>
      <item>intended readership</item>
      <item>... and many others</item>
      </list></item>
     <item>Partly on practical grounds but also to avoid the risk of circularity: we wanted to make it possible to classify texts automatically. </item>
     <item>The goal was to provide good coverage for each criterion, such that the sample would not
      be dominated by any specific author gender or canonicity-value. <list><item>This same concern to avoid
      bias led us to impose an additional constraint that no more than three works should be
      selected for any given author</item></list></item>
    </list>
   </div>
   <div type="slide">
    <head>What is a novel?></head>
    <list>
     <item>Our definition is fairly broad: <list>
      <item>continuous prose fiction </item>
      <item>first published between 1840 and 1920</item>
      <item>first published in the target language</item>
      <item>of size between 50 and 200 thousand words (so no collected short stories)</item>
      <item>intended for an adult audience</item>
      </list></item>
     <item>But ... <list>
      <item>these criteria effectively ruled out some significant language traditions (e.g. nothing
       or very little of any kind was published in Irish, Latvian, or Lithuanian before 1900)</item>
       <item>the concepts of “language” and “country” are problematic in the historical European
       context</item>
      <item>the ease with which balance criteria could be satisfied varied greatly across language </item>
      <item>for some criteria, notably author gender, identifying a balanced sample proved
       impossible.</item>
      </list></item>
    </list>
   </div>
   <div type="slide">
    <head>Language is a problem</head>
    <p>The association between languages, countries, and literary traditions is far from being
     unequivocal or simple. </p>
    <list>
     <item>Many European countries (Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, for example) have two or more
      official languages, each with its own publishing tradition. </item>
     <item>In many countries, particularly during the 19th century, the language of culture and
      consequently of publication was not the national language but rather German, French, or
      English. </item>
     <item>The same language or a dialectal variant of it may be found in several different
      countries (Swiss German, or Belgian French, for example). </item>
     <item>Different languages may be considered the cultural norm in different regions of a single
      country (Euskera or Catalan in Spain, for example), and will thus have a claim to be
      represented by their own language corpus.</item>
    </list>
    <p>A pragmatic approach lead us to exclude <list>
     <item>works by non-European authors (e.g. Henry James) </item>
     <item>Works published in a language other than that of their original place of publication
      (e.g. Kafka) </item>
     </list> but to include <list>
     <item>European authors publishing in some language other than their own (e.g. Conrad)</item>
     <item>additional language corpora such as ELTeC-gsw, ELTeC-eus</item>
     </list></p>
   </div>

   <div type="slide">
    <head>Sex is a problem</head>
    <list>
     <item>For some language populations, it is known that the proportion of female to male authors
      varies considerably over time</item>
     <item>For example, ATCL database lists 22,255 titles published between 1837 and 1901, produced
      by a total of 2067 women, 2497 men, and 623 unknown. </item>

    <head>Our workflow</head>
    <list>
     <item>The overall balance of each corpus was assessed during its development</item>
     <item>The E5C tool was used to assess objectively the degree of compliance for each corpus<list>
      <item>https://github.com/distantreading/WG1/wiki/E5C-discussion-paper</item>
      </list></item>
     <item>In some cases, an <term>extension corpus</term> was used to hold texts which disturbed
      overall corpus balance</item>
    </list>
   </div>

   <div>
    <head>ELTeC Levels</head>
    <p>At the start of the project, the concept of <term>level</term> was introduced to characterize
     the richness of the TEI encoding or annotation applied to an ELTeC text.
     <list>
     <item>level 0 : only a bare minimum of features are distinguished by the markup </item>
     <item>level 1 : some additional semantic features are marked up</item>
     <item>level 2 : additional annotation of linguistic features (pos code, NER etc.)</item>
     </list></p>
    <p>In practice almost all ELTeC texts are marked up at level 1, with a high degree of
     consistency as to which TEI elements are used and in what context. </p>
    <p>The definition of a schema for level 2 texts proved more problematic, for a variety of
     reasons, both personal and technical.</p>
   </div>

   <div type="slide">
    <head>State of play</head>
    <list>
     <item>There are 17 distinct ElTeC corpora (Czech, German, English, French, Swiss German, Croatian, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Slovenian, Spanish, Serbian, Swedish, and Ukrainian); in total about 107 million words. </item>
     <item>Only five of thes have an E5C score below 75%</item>
     <item>5 of them are also marked up to level 2</item>

     <item>The "extension" concept reapplied to corpora, such as eltec-fra-ext, which use a

    </list>
   </div><div type="slide"><head>Conclusions</head>
   <list>
    <item>We learned a great deal about collaboration, about the complexities of cross-cultural comparisons, about finding an appropriate technologies for literary studies ... and about the European novel!</item><item>We suggest that any effective computational infrastructure for literary studies will need to follow our example, if only in the creation of shared textual resources </item>
