-------------- Christof's Mail-------------------
Dear all, 


as part of our "final event", we will also have a        brief Core Group Meeting (Thursday, 9-10am). 
You can find a draft agenda here: https://wiki.distant-reading.net/index.php?title=April_2022_Core_Group_Meeting        

The Zoom access data is the following: 
Link: https://uni-trier.zoom.us/j/88079740955?pwd=ME9kOS9reXU1cEhuQmNCRTdSSWt1dz09
Meeting ID: 880 7974 0955
Passcode: 1qGzTVq6

Please, dear WG leads, prepare a brief statement        on the current state of affairs, recent developments or a last        set of plans for wrapping things up or sustaining activities        beyond the Action. 


Also, please send me and Maciej a brief statement        with a list of the 3-5 key things you believe your WG achieved        during the Action. We are expected by COST to make a brief        presentation on this topic as part of the closing conference and        your input will be very helpful to make sure Maciej and me don't        forget anything important. 


Please also note that there is a slot for WG        meetings on April 21st, from 11am to 1pm. We can use ths same        Zoom room and create breakout rooms for the WGs, for people to        move freely between rooms. You can use this meeting slot also to        make plans and/or to wrap things up. 


The overview of the meetings is here:        https://www.distant-reading.net/events/final-action-event/ 


I think we can just use the same Zoom room for the        whole morning, to make things easier. 


See you next week and best wishes, 
Christof
