1. Updates on ELTeC
Summary table: https://distantreading.github.io/ELTeC/index.html

Short report on the current status of the individual language corpora.

hun (GP)
not much happened since the last release. ~ 400 novels are in the own gitHub repository / thereof ~ 100 comply with the ELTeC criteria. Will include NER, reuse code that has to be adjusted. CS proposes to add a hun-ext to ELTeC repo. https://regenykorpusz.elte-dh.hu/

por (DS)
Level 2 is complete, waiting for decisions on level 2:  e.g. concerning NER

lit (AG)
All existing novels were recorded, there do not exist more. 

nor (MP)
55 level 2 (POS, but no NEs)
There are novels that do not meet criteria. CO proposes to add nor-ext; if you add more than three titles per author it decreases the score. 

srp (CK)
Already 100 novels. Will replace some of the novels with novels that better meet the criteria. The replaced ones will be included in the extension. 

eng (LB)
Working on level 2

fra (CS)
Level 2 present; 388 novels in the extension (= level 1), see: https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC-fra-ext. Another extension is coming, ca. 120 French novels published between 1750 and 1800.  

cze -- (MK)
Finished 100 novels in level 1

deu -- (CO)
Finished collection in level 1, no further main changes are planned


Encoding level 2
Notes from WG2 + WG1 meeting in September 2021 
https://github.com/distantreading/WG2/blob/master/other_notes/level2-status-2021.md 

Current status:
@pos exists in every level 2 encoding; 
some do sentence markers, some not

TE: we need a common XML schema for level 2. 
LB: for example, what if we say that every <pc> and <w> has to be in an <s>? 
Decision to create schema that imposes <s>. 
Action on LB: Add to readme what the difference between eltec-2.rng and eltec-2_strict.rng is (see https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/Schemas)

2. ELTeC Dissemination
What can we offer? We aim to have different dissemination strategies: CLS Infra, Zenodo, GAMS, TXM, etc.

GAMS: https://gams.uni-graz.at/
Sustainable service for managing, publishing and long-term preservation of data; repository for hosting data such as ELTeC
Sandbox ELTeC in GAMS: http://glossa.uni-graz.at/context:eltec
There will be a short meeting on the GAMS representation with MS on February 23.

Zenodo releases and doi should be made visible

Another service proposed by TE: https://www.clarin.si/noske/run.cgi/corp_info?corpname=eltec_slv&struct_attr_stats=1

Serge Heiden is willing to provide ELTeC in txm
