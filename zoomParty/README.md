# Virtual WG1 Meeting, Dec 7 2020

## Report on preparing texts for ELTeC

The goal of this event is to exchange experiences and workflows in preparing texts for ELTeC. 
A representative from each language collection will be asked to briefly present (10 minutes max) their preparation process.

Each report should cover, if possible:
- how was the project organized ? (personnel, managementâ€¦)
- what is the current state of the collection ? (E5C, encoding, open issues, etc.)
- how were texts selected? (source/s used; balancing methods etc, )
- how did you learn how to use TEI ? (self-study, training, previous knowledge? )
- how were texts processed? (software used etc.)
- what problems did you encounter?

You could also pre-circulate a longer written report if you wish.

During the wrap up discussion, we will ask
- if you were starting again, what would you do differently in the light of your experience so far?
- what do you plan to do for the remainder of the Action?
- how should the ELTeC be further developed?

We plan to record the proceedings, and use them as the basis for a future publication.
